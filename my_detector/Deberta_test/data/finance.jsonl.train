It may be worth saving up for a larger down payment if it means you can get a lower interest rate on your mortgage, or if it means you will have more equity in your home.

After expiration the option is worthless if it is out of the money but other than that has no hangover. Option prices normally drop as the time value of the option decays. An option has two values associated with it; time value and exercise value. Far out of the money (when the price of the underlying is far from the strike price on the losing side) options only have time value whereas deep in the money options (as yours seems to be) has some time value as well as the intrinsic value of the right to buy (sell) at a low (high) price and then sell (buy) the underlying.  The time value of the option comes from the possibility that the price of the underlying will move (further) in your favour and make you more money at expiry. As expiry closes it is less likely that there will be a favourable mood so this value declines which can cause prices to move sharply after a period of little to no revaluing.

They have cashed out at a price that suited them and limited what they will lose if they are right about the underlying.

The down payment can be used to lower your monthly payments, but it will not be applied to the purchase price of the car if you decide to buy it at the end of the lease.Mileage limits: Leasing contracts often have mileage limits, which means you are only allowed to drive the car a certain number of miles per year. If you exceed the mileage limit, you may be charged a fee for each additional mile. This can be an issue if you plan to drive the car a lot or if you are unsure how much you will be driving.Maintenance: When you lease a car, you are responsible for maintaining it in good condition.

It is typically expressed as a percentage of the home's purchase price. For example, if you are buying a home for $200,000 and you put down 20%, your down payment would be $40,000.

PMI protects the lender in the event that you default on your mortgage payments. The cost of PMI is typically added to your monthly mortgage payments, and it can be removed once you have built up enough equity in your home.Points: Points are a type of fee that you may be required to pay at closing when you take out a mortgage. One point is equal to 1% of the mortgage loan amount. Points are typically used to buy down the interest rate on a mortgage, which can lower your monthly payments. However, the decision to pay points is a trade-off, as you may pay more up front in exchange for lower monthly payments over the life of the loan.It's important to carefully consider all of these factors when buying a home, and to consult with a financial professional to determine the best options for your specific situation."}, {"label": 0, "content": "Academic research into ADRs seems to suggest that pairs-trading ADRs and their underlying shares reveals that there certainly are arbitrage opportunities, but that in most (but not all cases) such opportunities are quickly taken care of by the market.

The main problems with a high home bias is that the investment universe in your small local investment market is usually geared toward your coutries large corporations. Lack of diversification: In your case: the ASX top 4 are all financials, actually banks, making up almost 25% of the index. I would expect the bond market to be similarly concentrated but I dont know. In a portfolio context, this is certainly a negative. Liquidity: A smaller economy obviously has less large corporations when compared globally (check wikipedia / List_of_public_corporations_by_market_capitalization) thereby offering lower liquidity and a smaller investment universe. Currency Risk: I like your point on not taking a stance on FX. This simplifies the task to find a hedge ratio that minimises portfolio volatility when investing internationally and dealing with currencies. For equities, you would usually find that a hedge ratio anywhere from 0-30% is effective and for bonds one that ranges from 80-100%. The reason is that in an equity portfolio, currency risk contributes less to overall volatility than in a bond portfolio. Therefore you will need to hedge less to achieve the lowest possible risk. Interestingly, from a global perspective, we find, that the AUD is a special case whereby, if you hedge the AUD you actually increase total portfolio risk. Maybe it has to do with the AUD being used in carry trades a lot, but that is a wild guess.

Con: Credit cards are more risky. If someone finds your card, they can use it for online purchases without knowing any PIN, just by entering the card number, expiration date, and security code on the back. Worse, sometimes that information is stored in databases, and those get stolen by hackers! Also, you can have agreed to do periodic payments on some website and forgot about them, stopped using the service, and be surprised about the charge later. Debit cards usually need some kind of device that requires your PIN to do online payments (the ones I have in the Netherlands do, anyway), and automated periodic payments are authorized at your bank where you can get an overview of the currently active ones. Con: Banks get a percentage of each credit card payment. Unlike debit cards where companies usually pay a tiny fixed fee for each transaction (of, say, half a cent), credit card payments usually cost them a percentage and it comes to much more, a significant part of the profit margin. I feel this is just wrong. Con: automatic monthly payment can come at an unexpected moment With debit cards, the amount is withdrawn immediately and if the money isn't there, you get an error message allowing you to pay some other way (credit card after all, other bank account, cash, etc). When a recent monthly payment from my credit card was due to be charged from my bank account recently, someone else had been paid from it earlier that day and the money wasn't there. So I had to pay interest, on something I bought weeks ago... Pro: Credit cards apparently have some kind of insurance. I've never used this and don't know how it works, but apparently you can get your money back easily after fraudulent charges. Pro: Credit cards can be more easily used internationally for online purchases I don't know how it is with Visa or MC-issued debit cards, but many US sites accept only cards that have number/expiration date/security code and thus my normal bank account debit card isn't useable.

Construction loans typically require a down payment of at least 20% of the total cost of the project, and the loan is typically paid off once the construction is complete and the house is sold or refinanced.It's important to note that construction loans can be more expensive and have higher interest rates than traditional mortgages, as they involve a higher level of risk for the lender. You may also be required to have a higher credit score and a higher debt-to-income ratio to qualify for a construction loan.In addition to obtaining financing for the construction of the new house, you will also need to consider the financing for the land on which the new house will be built.

Long story short, a great deal of research has found that actively-managed funds underperform market indexes and passively-managed funds because of their high turnover and higher fees, among other factors.  Longer answer: Chris is right in stating that survivorship bias presents a problem for such research; however, there are several academic papers that address the survivorship problem, as well as the wider subject of active vs. passive performance. I'll try to provide a brief summary of some of the relevant literature.  The seminal paper that started the debate is Michael Jensen's 1968 paper titled \"The Performance of Mutual Funds in the Period 1945-1964\". This is the paper where Jensen's alpha, the ubiquitous measure of the performance of mutual fund managers, was first defined. Using a dataset of 115 mutual fund managers, Jensen finds that The evidence on mutual fund performance indicates not only that these 115 mutual funds were on average not able to predict security prices well enough to outperform a buy-the-market-and-hold policy, but also that there is very little evidence that any individual fund was able to do significantly better than that which we expected from mere random chance. Although this paper doesn't address problems of survivorship, it's notable because, among other points, it found that managers who actively picked stocks performed worse even when fund expenses were ignored. Since actively-managed funds tend to have higher expenses than passive funds, the actual picture looks even worse for actively managed funds. A more recent paper on the subject, which draws similar conclusions, is Martin Gruber's 1996 paper \"Another puzzle: The growth in actively managed mutual funds\". Gruber calls it \"a puzzle\" that investors still invest in actively-managed funds, given that their performance on average has been inferior to that of index funds. He addresses survivorship bias by tracking funds across the entire sample, including through mergers. Since most mutual funds that disappear are merged into existing funds, he assumes that investors in a fund that disappear choose to continue investing their money in the fund that resulted from the merger. Using this assumption and standard measures of mutual fund performance, Gruber finds that mutual funds underperform an appropriately weighted average of the indices by about 65 basis points per year. Expense ratios for my sample averaged 113 basis points a year. These numbers suggest that active management adds value, but that mutual funds charge the investor more than the value added. Another nice paper is Mark Carhart's 1997 paper \"On persistence in mutual fund performance\" uses a sample free of survivorship bias because it includes \"all known equity funds over this period.\" It's worth quoting parts of this paper in full: I demonstrate that expenses have at least a one-for-one negative impact on fund performance, and that turnover also negatively impacts performance. ... Trading reduces performance by approximately 0.95% of the trade's market value.  In reference to expense ratios and other fees, Carhart finds that The investment costs of expense ratios, transaction costs, and load fees all have a direct, negative impact on performance. The study also finds that funds with abnormally high returns last year usually have higher-than-expected returns next year, but not in the following years, because of momentum effects. Lest you think the news is all bad, Russ Wermer's 2000 study \"Mutual fund performance: An empirical decomposition into stock\u2010picking talent, style, transactions costs, and expenses\" provides an interesting result. He finds that many actively-managed mutual funds hold stocks that outperform the market, even though the net return of the funds themselves underperforms passive funds and the market itself.  On a net-return level, the funds underperform broad market indexes by one percent a year. Of the 2.3% difference between the returns on stock holdings and the net returns of the funds, 0.7% per year is due to the lower average returns of the nonstock holdings of the funds during the period (relative to stocks). The remaining 1.6% per year is split almost evenly between the expense ratios and the transaction costs of the funds. The final paper I'll cite is a 2008 paper by Fama and French (of the Fama-French model covered in business schools) titled, appropriately, \"Mutual Fund Performance\". The paper is pretty technical, and somewhat above my level at this time of night, but the authors state one of their conclusions bluntly quite early on: After costs (that is, in terms of net returns to investors) active investment is a negative sum game.  Emphasis mine. In short, expense ratios, transaction costs, and other fees quickly diminish the returns to active investment. They find that The [value-weight] portfolio of mutual funds that invest primarily in U.S. equities is close to the market portfolio, and estimated before fees and expenses, its alpha is close to zero. Since the [value-weight] portfolio of funds produces an \u03b1 close to zero in gross returns, the alpha estimated on the net returns to investors is negative by about the amount of fees and expenses. This implies that the higher the fees, the farther alpha decreases below zero. Since actively-managed mutual funds tend to have higher expense ratios than passively-managed index funds, it's safe to say that their net return to the investor is worse than a market index itself. I don't know of any free datasets that would allow you to research this, but one highly-regarded commercial dataset is the CRSP Survivor-Bias-Free US Mutual Fund Database from the Center for Research in Security Prices at the University of Chicago.

This can be done using publicly available data from a reliable source, such as a mutual fund database or financial news website.To make the comparison more meaningful, it is important to select low expense ratio and high expense ratio funds that are similar in other ways, such as asset class, investment style, and risk level. This will help ensure that any differences in performance are due to the expense ratio rather than other factors.Once you have gathered the necessary data, you can use a tool such as a spreadsheet or charting software to create a graph or chart that illustrates the performance of the low expense ratio and high expense ratio funds over time. This can help make it easier to see the difference in performance and understand the impact of the expense ratio on fund returns.It is worth noting that past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results, so it is important to consider other factors in addition to expense ratio when selecting an investment.

Some factors that may influence how much you should save include your age, your income level, your current debts, your expected expenses in the near future (such as the cost of buying a home or paying for a child's education), and your long-term financial goals (such as retirement).Here are a few general guidelines that may be helpful as you consider how much to save:Many financial experts recommend saving at least 20% of your income. This can help you build a solid financial foundation and ensure that you have the resources you need to meet your financial goals.If you are just starting out in your career and have a lower income, you may need to save a smaller percentage of your income. However, it is still important to start saving as soon as possible, even if it is only a small amount.If you are trying to pay off high-interest debt, such as credit card debt, you may want to save a higher percentage of your income until you have paid off this debt. This can help you get out of debt more quickly and save money on interest payments.If you are nearing retirement age and have not yet saved enough for retirement, you may need to save a higher percentage of your income to catch up.Ultimately, the best approach for you will depend on your specific financial situation and goals.

Invest the 300K in safe liquid investments then move the maximum amount each year into your retirement accounts. Depending on which company you work for that could include 401K (Regular or Roth), deductible IRA, Roth IRA. The amount of money you can transfer is a function of the options they give you, how much they match, and the amount of income you earn. For the 401K you will invest from your paycheck, but pull an equal amount from the remainder of the 300K. If you are married you can use the same procedure for your spouse's account. You current income funds any vacations or splurges, because you will not need to put additional funds into your retirement plan. By your late 30's the 300K will now be fully invested in retirement account. Unfortunately you can't touch much of it without paying penalties until you are closer to age 60. Each year before semi-retirement, you will have to invest some of your salary into non-retirement accounts to cushion you between age 40 and age 60. Invest/start a business: Take a chunk of the  300K, and decide that in X years you will use it to start a small business. This chunk of money must be liquid and invested safely so that you can use it when you want to. You also don't want to invest it in investments that have a risk of loss. Take the remaining funds and invest it as described in the no small business section. You will completely convert funds to retirement funds earlier because of a smaller starting amount. Hopefully the small business creates enough income to allow you to continue to fund retirement or semi-retirement. But it might not.

Investing in stocks: If your time horizon is short, then stocks are too volatile. If it drops just before you need the money, it might not recover in time. Final Advice: Get a financial adviser that will lay out a complete plan for a fixed fee. They will discuss investment options, types not particular funds.

Fast execution of trades is desirable in exchanges.  Imagine two exchanges:  One only executes trades once a month, the other executes trades once a week.  Which exchange would be more desirable?

HFT has been a controversial topic, with some arguing that it provides liquidity and other efficiencies to financial markets, while others claim that it can lead to market manipulation and instability.One argument in favor of HFT is that it helps to increase liquidity in financial markets by providing a source of demand and supply for securities. HFT firms may also provide price discovery services, helping to identify the fair value of securities and contributing to price efficiency. Additionally, HFT can help to reduce the cost of trading for investors by providing competition among market makers and contributing to tighter spreads between bid and ask prices.However, some critics argue that HFT can contribute to market instability and unfairness. For example, HFT firms may be able to execute trades faster than other traders, giving them an advantage in certain market conditions. There have also been concerns about the potential for HFT firms to engage in manipulative or predatory practices, such as placing and then quickly canceling orders in order to create the appearance of market activity or to manipulate prices.Overall, the economic value of HFT is a matter of debate.

In practice it's very tricky for you to successfully navigate paying arbitrarily more for a stock than it's currently listed for, and selling it back again for enough to cover the difference.  Yes, the price could drop to $28, but it could just as easily drop to $27.73 (or further) and now you're hurting, before even taking into account the potentially hefty commissions involved. Another way to think about it is to recognize that an option transaction is a bet; the buyer is betting a small amount of money that a stock will move in the direction they expect, the seller is betting a large amount of money that the same stock will not.  One of you has to lose.  And unless you've some reason to be solidly confident in your predictive powers the loser, long term, is quite likely to be you. Now that said, it is possible (particularly when selling puts) to create win-win scenarios for yourself, where you're betting one direction, but you'd be perfectly happy with the alternative(s).   Here's an example.  Suppose, unrelated to the option chain, you've come to the conclusion that you'd be happy paying $28 for BBY.  It's currently (June 2011) at ~$31, so you can't buy it on the open market for a price you'd be happy with.  But you could sell a $28 put, promising to buy it at that price should someone want to sell it (presumably, because the price is now below $28). Either the put expires worthless and you pocket a few bucks and you're basically no worse off because the stock is still overpriced by your estimates, or the option is executed, and you receive 100 shares of BBY at a price you previously decided you were willing to pay.  Even if the list price is now lower, long term you expect the stock to be worth more than $28.  Conceptually, this makes selling a put very similar to being paid to place a limit order to buy the stock itself. Of course, you could be wrong in your estimate (too low, and you now have a position that might not become profitable; too high, and you never get in and instead just watch the stock gain in value), but that is not unique to options - if you're bad at estimating value (which is not to be confused with predicting price movement) you're doomed just about whatever you do."}, {"label": 1, "content": "Yes, it is possible to profit from selling a put option on BBY, also known as writing a put.

However, if the stock price falls below the strike price before the expiration date, the put option may be exercised, which means you will be required to buy the stock at the strike price. If you do not already own the stock, you will need to purchase it at the current market price, which could be higher than the strike price.

Alan and Denise Fields discuss them in more detail in Your New House. Permanent work.  Where do you want to live?  Are there suitable jobs nearby?  How much do they pay? Emergency fund.  Banks care that you have \"reserves\" (and/or an unsecured line of credit) in case you have a run of bad luck.  This also helps with float the large expenses when closing a loan. Personal line of credit. Who are you building for?  If you are not married, then you should consider whether building a home makes that easier, or harder.  If you hope to have kids, you should consider whether your home will make it easier to have kids, or harder.  If you are married (or seriously considering it), make sure that your spouse helps with the shopping, and is in agreement on the priorities and choices.  If you are not married, then what will you do if/when you get married?  Will you sell?  expand?  build another house on the same lot?  rent the home out? Total budget.  How much can the lot, utilities, permits, taxes, financing charges, building costs, and contingency allowance come to?  Talk with a banker about how much you can afford.  Talk with a build-on-your-lot builder about how much house you can get for that budget.  Consider a new mobile or manufactured home.  But if you do choose one, ask your banker how that affects what you can borrow, and how it affects your rates and terms.  Talk with a good real estate agent about how much the resale value might be. Finished lot budget. How much can you budget for the lot, utilities, permits required to get zoning approval, fees, interest, and taxes before you start construction? Down payment.  It sounds like you have a plan for this. Loan underwriting.  Talk with a good bank loan officer about what their expectations are.  Ask about the \"front-end\" and \"back-end\" Debt-To-Income ratios.  In Oregon, I recommend Washington Federal for lot loans and construction loans.  They keep all of their loans, and service the loans themselves.  They use appraisers who are specially trained in evaluating new home construction.  Their appraisers tend to appraise a bit low, but not ridiculously low like the incompetent appraisers used by some other banks in the area.  (I know two banks with lots of Oregon branches that use an appraiser who ignores 40% of the finished, heated area of some to-be-built homes.)  Avoid any institution (including USAA and NavyFed) that outsources their lending to PHH. Lot loan.  In Oregon, Washington Federal offers lot loans with 30% down payments, 20-year amortization, and one point, on approved credit.  The interest rate can be a fixed rate, but is typically a few percentage points per year higher than for a mortgage secured by a permanent house.  If you have the financial wherewithal to start building within two years, Washington Federal also offers short-term lot loans.  Ask about the costs of appraisals, points, and recording fees. Rent.  How much will it cost to rent a place to live, between when you move back to Oregon, and when your new home is ready to move into? Commute.  How much time will it take to get from your new home to work?  How much will it cost?  (E.g., car ownership, depreciation, maintenance, insurance, taxes, fuel?  If public transportation is an option, how much will it cost?) Lot availability.  How many are there to choose from?  Can you talk a farmer into selling off a chunk of land?  Can you homestead government land?  How much does a lot cost?  Is it worth getting a double lot (or an extra large lot)? Utilities. Do you want to live off the grid?  Are you willing to make the choices needed to do that?  (E.g., well, generator, septic system, satellite TV and telephony, fuel storage)  If not, how much will it cost to connect to such systems?  (For practical purposes, subtract twice the value of these installation costs from the cost of a finished lot, when comparing lot deals.) Easements. These provide access to your property, access for others through your property, and affect your rights.  Utility companies often ask for far more rights than they need.  Until you sign on the dotted line, you can negotiate them down to just what they need.  Talk to a good real estate attorney. Zoning. How much will you be allowed to build?  (In terms of home square footage, garage square footage, roof area, and impermeable surfaces.)  How can the home be used?  (As a business, as a farm, how many unrelated people can live there, etc.)  What setbacks are required?  How tall can the building(s) be?  Are there setbacks from streams, swamps, ponds, wetlands, or steep slopes? Choosing a builder.  For construction loans, banks want builders who will build what is agreed upon, in a timely fashion.  If you want to build your own house, talk to your loan officer about what the bank expects in a builder. Plansets and permits.  The construction loan process. If you hire a general contractor, and if you have difficulties with the contractor, you might be forced to refuse to accept some work as being complete.  A good bank will back you up.  Ask about points, appraisal charges, and inspection fees. Insurance during construction.  Some companies have good plans -- if the construction takes 12 months or less.  Some (but not all) auto insurance companies also offer good homeowners' insurance for homes under construction.  Choose your auto insurance company accordingly. Property taxes. Don't forget to include them in your post-construction budget. Homeowners' insurance.  Avoid properties that need flood insurance.  Apply a sanity check to flood maps -- some of them are unrealistic.  Strongly consider earthquake insurance.  Don't forget to include these costs in your post-construction budget. Energy costs.  Some jurisdictions require you to calculate how large a heating system you need.  Do not trust their design temperatures -- they may not allow for enough heating during a cold snap, especially if you have a heat pump.  (Some heat pumps work at -10\u00b0F -- but most lose their effectiveness between 10\u00b0F and 25\u00b0F.)  You can use these calculations, in combination with the number of \"heating degree days\" and \"cooling degree days\" at your site, to accurately estimate your energy bills.  If you choose a mobile or manufactured home, calculate how much extra its energy bills will be. Home design.  Here are some good sources of ideas: A Pattern Language, by Christopher Alexander.

This book applies many Alexander's design patterns to medium and large new houses. Before the Architect.  The late Ralph Pressel emphasized the importance of plywood sheathing, flashing, pocket doors, wide hallways, wide stairways, attic trusses, and open-truss or I-joist floor systems.  Lots of outlets and incandescent lighting are good too.  (It is possible to have too much detail in a house plan, and too much room in a house.  For examples, see any of his plans.)

We planned on selling a Condo a few months later, so we only needed the loan for a short period but wanted to keep monthly payments low since we would be paying two mortgages for a few months. I also felt like the market might take a dip in the future, so I liked the idea of trying to cash out high and buy back low (spoiler alert: this didn't happen). So in July 2017 I withdrew $17,000 from my account (Technically $16,850.00 principal and $150 processing fee) at an effective 4.19% APR (4% rate and then the fee), with 240 scheduled payments of $86.00 (2 per month for 10 years). Over the lifetime of the loan the total finance charge was $3,790, but that money would be paid back into my account. I was happy with the terms, and it helped tide things over until the condo was sold a few months later. But then I decided to change jobs, and ended up having to pay back the loan ~20 weeks after it was issued (using the proceeds from the sale of the condo). During this time the market had done well, so when I paid back the funds the net difference in shares that I now owned (including shares purchased with the interest payments) was $538.25 less than today's value of the original count of shares that were sold to fund the loan. Combined with the $150 fee, the overall \"cost\" of the 20 week loan was about 4.05%. That isn't the interest rate (interest was paid back to my account balance), but the value lost due to the principal having been withdrawn. On paper, my account would be worth that much more if I hadn't withdrawn the money. Now if you extrapolate the current market return into 52 weeks, you can think of that loan having an APR \"cost\" of around 10.5% (Probably not valid for a multi year calculation, but seems accurate for a 12 month projection). Again, that is not interest paid back to the account, but instead the value lost due to the money not being in the account. Sure, the market could take a dip and I may be able to buy the shares back at a reduced cost, but that would require keeping sizable liquid assets around and trying to time the market. It also is not something you can really schedule very well, as the loan took 6 days to fund (not including another week of clarifying questions back/forth before that) and 10 day to repay (from the time I initiated the paperwork to when the check was cashed and shares repurchased). So in my experience, the true cost of the loan greatly depends on how the market does, and if you have the ability to pay back the loan it probably is worth doing so.

This means that you are essentially losing money by borrowing from your 401(k) instead of investing it.Risk: When you borrow from your 401(k), you are taking on additional risk. If you lose your job or leave the company, you may be required to repay the loan in a short period of time, which could be difficult if you don't have the money.Opportunity cost: By borrowing from your 401(k), you are missing out on the potential growth of your investments.

Some of the main reasons why investors might purchase bonds include:Income: One of the primary reasons people buy bonds is for the income they generate. When you buy a bond, you are essentially lending money to the issuer in exchange for regular interest payments. These interest payments can provide a steady stream of income, which can be especially useful for retirees or other investors who rely on their investment portfolio for income.Diversification: Adding bonds to your investment portfolio can help to diversify your holdings and reduce risk. Because the prices of bonds and stocks tend to move in opposite directions, having a mix of both can help to smooth out the overall volatility of your portfolio.Safety: Another reason people buy bonds is for the relative safety they offer. While no investment is completely risk-free, bonds are generally considered to be less risky than stocks. This is because the issuer is obligated to pay the bondholder the principal and interest that is due.Capital appreciation: While the main focus of bonds is usually the income they generate, some investors also buy bonds with the hope of making a profit by selling them for more than they paid. This can occur if interest rates fall and the value of the bond rises as a result.Overall, the decision to purchase bonds should be based on your investment objectives and risk tolerance. It's important to understand the characteristics of different types of bonds and to diversify your bond holdings in order to manage risk."}, {"label": 0, "content": "In Japan, there's a competition well-lasting since 2004 or so where you can run your own software agent in a virtual market.

A credit rating is typically assigned by a credit rating agency, such as Moody's, Standard & Poor's, or Fitch Ratings.The creditworthiness of a company is generally based on its financial strength and stability, as well as its ability to generate revenue and profits. If a company has a strong financial profile, it may be assigned a higher credit rating than the country in which it is located. This can be due to a number of factors, including the company's ability to access capital markets, its diversified revenue streams, and its strong management team.On the other hand, if a country has a weaker economy or a less stable political environment, it may be assigned a lower credit rating than a company located within that country. This can make it more difficult for the country to access capital markets and can lead to higher borrowing costs."}, {"label": 0, "content": "How so? If i sell short, then i make a profit only if the price goes down so i can buy back at a lower price. Yes, but if the price is going up then you would go long instead. Shorting a stock (or any other asset) allows you to profit when the price is going down. Going long allows you to profit when the price is going up. In the opposite cases, you lose money. In order to make a profit in either of those situations, you have to accurately assess which way the price will trade over the period of time you are dealing with. If you make the wrong judgment, then you lose money because you'll either sell for a lower price than you bought (if you went long), or have to buy back at a higher price than you sold for (if you went short).

There are of course thousands of things that you can do with your money to \"help the economy\".  But I think that there is room to discuss some broad strokes without trying to list a thousand details.   Regular investing (as you are now) helps the economy in that companies obtain money by selling their stock.  They can then use that money to fund expansion, etc.  These things can help the economy permanently.  Of course, they can also use the money to pay executive bonuses, which don't help the economy so much.   Similarly, just spending money does not normally help the economy.  Unless we are in a recession, it is mildly harmful to spend wastefully.  Money that could be going to support long term improvements in production instead is used to buy a luxury that doesn't terribly interest you.  I.e. if you don't want a bigger house or a more luxurious car don't buy it to \"stimulate\" the economy.   Many charitable donations have the same problem.  They help short term consumption somewhere.  And of course the charity starts asking you for more money.  Many charities waste most of a donation trying to get another one from the same person or family.   Sir John Maynard Keynes proposed that the best thing that people could do to help the economy is to invest in things that cause economic activity in turn.  He was mostly talking about things like roads, bridges, and dams that are out of the investing range of most people, so he wanted governments to do it, particularly during a recession.   So we are looking for ways to invest in durable improvements that will support economic activity in the future.  A million dollars is a small amount for many things, but there are some activities that work.  I'm going to list a few examples, but there are certainly others:   Fund microfinance.  Basically loan your million dollars to people who need a small amount of money.  These programs often allow you to determine the initial recipient and then that person determines the next recipient.  A million dollars can finance hundreds if not thousands of these loans.  They may be in the United States or in a developing country.   Set up a scholarship.  My recommendation would be to find an existing scholarship with a few recipients and ask them to add one a year for the million dollars.  A million dollars should typically produce about a scholarship a year in returns after inflation.  Of course, that's just regular inflation.  Education inflation is higher.   Solar prize.  Fund a program that gives out one solar installation every year or five to a family that owns a house, is struggling to pay utilities, and makes a compelling case.  Basically, whenever the investment grows enough to support it, make a new prize.   Buy something that will help other people make money.   This is just six ideas off the top of my head.  The goal here is to create something lasting that will promote economic activity.  So a program that loans money forward.  Or a scholarship or free textbook, particularly in a STEM field.  A small piece of infrastructure that helps people move around to work or spend their money.  Solar is a bit of a stretch here, but it can be justified if you believe that an investment now is an investment in moving towards the future.   The key thing here is to make your money do double duty.  By spending your money during a recession or investing during the rest of the business cycle, you can get some value for your money.  But even better is if that spending has a societal return as well.  Microfinance, scholarships, and infrastructure do that.  There is the immediate spending, plus there is the effect of the spending.  A business is established.  A mind is trained and working at a high income job.

It's possible to buy both badly, and in the case of stocks, there are studies that show the typical investor lags the market by many percent.  Real estate is not a homogeneous asset class. A $200K house renting for $1,000 is a far different investment than a $100K 3 family renting for $2,000 total rents. Both exist depending on the part of the country you are in.  If you simply divide the price to the rent you get either 16.7X or 4.2X. This is an oversimplification, and of course, interest rates will push these numbers in one direction or another. It's safe to say that at any given time, the ratio can help determine if home prices are too high, a bargain, or somewhere in between.  As one article suggests, the median price tracks inflation pretty closely. And I'd add, that median home prices would track median income long term.  To circle back, yes, real estate can be a good investment if you buy right, find good tenants, and are willing to put in the time.  Note: Buying to rent and buying to live in are not always the same economic decision. The home buyer will very often buy a larger house than they should, and turn their own 'profit' into a loss. e.g. A buyer who would otherwise be advised to buy the $150K house instead of renting is talked into a bigger house by the real estate agent, the bank, the spouse.

The trading warrants are exactly what it says, they are used for trading. They are similar to option and have calls and puts. As Cameron says, they differ from exchange traded options in that they are issued by the financial companies whereas options are generally written by other investors. Instalment warrants on the other hand are usually bought and sold by investors with a longer term view. There are no calls and puts and you can just go long with them. They are also issued by financial companies, and how they work is best explained through an example: if I was to buy a stock directly say I would be paying $50 per share, however an instalment warrant in the underlying stock may be offered for $27 per warrant. I could buy the warrant directly from the company when it is issued or on the secondary market just like shares. I would pay the $27 per warrant upfront, and then in 2 years time when the warrant expires I have the choice to purchase the underlying stock for the strike price of say $28, roll over to a new issue of warrants, sell it back on the secondary market, or let it expire, in which case I would receive any intrinsic value left in the warrant. You would have noticed that the warrant purchase price plus the strike price adds up to more than the share price ($55 compared to $50). This is the interest component inherent in the warrant which covers the borrowing costs until expiry, when you pay the second portion (the strike price) and receive the underlying shares. Another difference between Instalment warrants and trading warrants (and options) is that with instalment warrants you still get the full dividends just like the shares, but at a higher yield than the shares."}, {"label": 1, "content": "A stock warrant is a financial instrument that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a specified number of shares of stock at a fixed price, called the exercise price, at or within a certain time period.

The warrants will specify the number of shares that can be purchased, the exercise price, and the expiration date.Exercise: The holder of a warrant can exercise their right to purchase the underlying stock at any time before the expiration date as long as the stock is trading above the exercise price. To exercise the warrant, the holder must pay the exercise price plus any applicable fees.Expiration: If the holder does not exercise the warrant before the expiration date, the warrant becomes void and the holder no longer has the right to purchase the underlying stock.Warrants are similar to options, but they tend to have longer expiration periods and are usually issued by the company rather than traded on an exchange. Because warrants give the holder the right to purchase stock at a fixed price in the future, they can be an attractive investment for those who believe the stock price will increase over time.

A de minimis benefit is a minor benefit that is infrequent or unusual, and the value of which is minimal.

A CDS, in essence, is exactly what it sounds like a swap upon default. The typical arrangement is that a holder of non-risk free credit enters into an arrangement with a counterparty to pay the counterparty a portion of the income received from the non-risk free credit in exchange for being able to force the counterparty to deliver risk free credit if the non-risk free credit defaults. Banks use this mechanism to reduce the risk of the loans they produce while packaging them to be resold to investors.  Banks will typically buy CDSes on mortgages and corporate bonds, paying part of the income from interest payments received, to have the right to force counterparties, typically hedge funds and insurance companies, to swap national Treasuries upon the event that the mortgages or corporates default.  The banks receive less income yet are able to take on more inventory to sell to investors so that more loans can be made to borrowers, households and corporations.

Puts are a type of stock option where the seller of a put option promises to buy 100 shares of stock from the buyer of the put option at a pre-agreed price called the strike price on any day before expiration day.  The buyer of the put option does not have to sell (it is optional, thats why it is called buying an option).  However, the seller of the put is required to make good on their promise to the buyer. The broker can require the seller of the put option to have a deposit, called margin, to help make sure that they can make good on the promise.   Profit... The buyer can profit from the put option if the stock price moves down substantially.   The buyer of the put option does not need to own the stock, he can sell the option to someone else.  If the buyer of the put option also owns the stock, the put option can be thought of like an insurance policy on the value of the stock.  The seller of the put option profits if the stock price stays the same or rises.  Basically, the seller comes out best if they can sell put options that no one ends up using by expiration day. A spread is an investment consisting of buying one option and selling another. Let's put bull and put and spread together with an example from Apple. So, if you believed Apple Inc.

Net profit = $2,035 - $5,000 = -$2965 = LOSS of $2965 Best Case:  AAPL stays above 600 on expiration day in JAN. Net Profit = $2,035 - 0 = $2035 Break Even:  If AAPL drops to 579.65, the value of the 600 JAN AAPL put sold will equal the $2,035 collected and the bull put spread investor will break even.

The strategy is called a \"bull\" spread because it is a bullish strategy, meaning that it is based on the assumption that the underlying security will increase in price.The trader who uses a bull put spread hopes to profit from the difference between the two put options, with the goal being to make a profit if the underlying security increases in price. If the underlying security does increase in price, the value of the put option with the lower strike price will decrease, while the value of the put option with the higher strike price will increase. As a result, the trader can potentially make a profit by selling the put option with the higher strike price for more than the cost of purchasing the put option with the lower strike price.It's important to note that a bull put spread is a limited risk strategy, as the maximum loss is the difference between the strike prices of the two put options minus the premium received from selling the put option with the higher strike price.

That is, when you file your 2014 income tax return in early 2015, you may be able to take advantage of this measure for income already earned in 2014. Provided a couple has at least one child under the age of 18, the Family Tax Cut will permit the transfer of up to $50,000 of taxable income from the higher income spouse's income tax return to the lower income spouse's return.

LLCs are taxed as a partnership by default, but they can also elect to be taxed as a corporation.If an LLC is taxed as a partnership, the profits and losses of the business are passed through to the individual members of the LLC and are reported on their personal income tax returns. This means that the LLC does not pay taxes on its income at the corporate level; instead, the profits and losses are allocated to the members based on their ownership interests in the LLC and are taxed at the individual level.For example, if an LLC has a net loss for the year, each member of the LLC can claim their allocated share of the loss on their personal income tax return. This can help offset other sources of income and potentially reduce the member's overall tax liability. However, it's important to note that the IRS has rules in place to prevent individuals from using LLC losses to offset income from other sources in an abusive manner.If an LLC elects to be taxed as a corporation, it will be subject to corporate income tax on its profits. Any distributions to the members of the LLC will be treated as dividends, which are taxed at the individual level.It's worth noting that LLCs are generally more flexible than corporations when it comes to how profits and losses are allocated among the members. This can make them a good choice for small businesses that want to minimize their tax liability while still enjoying the liability protection of a corporation. However, it's important to consult with a tax professional to determine the best tax treatment for your LLC based on your specific circumstances."}, {"label": 0, "content": "what does negative Total Equity means in McDonald's balance sheet? It means that their liabilities exceed their total assets.  Usually is means that a company has accumulated losses over time, but that's just one explanation.   But, isn't McDonald a very healthy company, and never lost money? Just because a company has \"always\" money does not mean it's a healthy company.  It may have borrowed a lot of money in order to operate, and now the growth is not able to keep up with the debt load. In McDonald's case, the major driver in the equity change is the fact that they have bought back over $20 Billion in stock over the past few years, which reduces assets and equity.  If they had instead paid off debt, their equity would not be negative, but their debt may be so cheap (in terms of interest rate) that it made more financial sense to buy back stock instead of paying off debt.

These types of investments are generally low-risk and offer a fixed rate of return.

As an illustration of how money supply affects the economy, he used the example of a baby-sitting co-op.  While simplistic, it provides an easy to grasp notion of how printing money and restricting it (e.g. by pegging the currency to gold reserves) can affect the economy. Here is an excerpt from his webpage ( http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/howfast.html ): \"With the decline of the traditional extended family, in which relatives were available to take care of children at need, many parents in the United States have sought alternative arrangements. A popular scheme is the baby-sitting coop, in which a group of parents agree to help each other out on a reciprocal basis, with each parent serving both as baby-sitter and baby-sittee. Any such coop requires rules that ensure that all members do their fair share. One natural answer, at least to people accustomed to a market economy, is to use some kind of token or marker system: parents \"earn\" tokens by babysitting, then in turn hand over these tokens when their own children are minded by others. For example, a recently formed coop in Western Massachusetts uses Popsicle sticks, each representing one hour of babysitting. When a new parent enters the coop, he or she receives an initial allocation of ten sticks.  This system is self-regulating, in the sense that it automatically ensures that over any length of time a parent will put in more or less the same amount of time that he or she receives. It turns out, however, that establishing such a token system is not enough to make a coop work properly. It is also necessary to get the number of tokens per member more or less right. To see why, suppose that there were very few tokens in circulation. Parents will want on average to hold some reserve of tokens - enough to deal with the possibility that they may want to go out a few times before they have a chance to babysit themselves and earn more tokens. Any individual parent can, of course, try to accumulate more tokens by babysitting more and going out less. But what happens if almost everyone is trying to accumulate tokens - as they will be if there are very few in circulation? One parent's decision to go out is another's opportunity to babysit. So if everyone in the coop is trying to add to his or her reserve of tokens, there will be very few opportunities to babysit. This in turn will make people even more reluctant to go out, and use up their precious token reserves; and the level of activity in the coop may decline to a disappointingly low level.  The solution to this problem is, of course, simply to issue more Popsicle sticks. But not too many - because an excess of popsicle sticks can pose an equally severe problem. Suppose that almost everyone in the coop has more sticks than they need; then they will be eager to go out, but reluctant to babysit. It will therefore become hard to find babysitters - and since opportunities to use popsicle sticks will become rare, people will become even less willing to spend time and effort earning them. Too many tokens in circulation, then, can be just as destructive as too few.\" -- Paul Krugman, 1997 (accessed webpage 2010)."}, {"label": 1, "content": "Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and, subsequently, purchasing power is falling.

If the economy improves and exporters start growing profits, that means they will start to employ more people and employment will increase - and with higher employment, employees will become more confident to make purchases, including purchasing property. I feel the falling $AUD will be beneficial for the economy and the housing market. However, what you should consider is that with an improving economy and a rising property market, it will only be a matter of time before interest rates start rising. With a lower $AUD the RBA will be more confident in starting to increase interest rates. And increasing interest rates will have a dampening effect on the housing market. You are looking to buy a property to live in - so how long do you intend to live in and hold the property? I would assume at least for the medium to long term. If this is your intention then why are you getting cold feet? What you should be concerned about is that you do not overstretch on your borrowings! Make sure you allow a buffer of 2% to 3% above current interest rates so that if rates do go up you can still afford the repayments. And if you get a fixed rate - then you should allow the buffer in case variable rates are higher when your fixed period is over. Regarding the doomsayers telling you that property prices are going to crash - well they were saying that in 2008, then again in 2010, then again in 2012. I don't know about you but I have seen no crash. Sure when interest rates have gone up property prices have levelled off and maybe gone down by 10% to 15% in some areas, but as soon as interest rates start falling again property prices start increasing again. It's all part of the property cycle.  I actually find it is a better time to buy when interest rates are higher and you can negotiate a better bargain and lower price. Then when interest rates start falling you benefit from lower repayments and increasing property prices. The only way there will be a property crash in Australia is if there was a dramatic economic downturn and unemployment rates rose to 10% or higher. But with good economic conditions, an increasing population and low supplies of newly build housing in Australia, I see no dramatic crashes in the foreseeable future. Yes we may get periods of weakness when interest rates increase, with falls up to 15% in some areas, but no crash of 40% plus.

I'm with the others, don't call this a gift unless it is a gift.   I'd have him check with the bank that previously refused him a mortgage if putting both of you on a mortgage would allay their concerns.  Your cash flow would be paying the mortgage payment and if you failed to do so, then they could fall back on his.  That may make more sense to them, even if they would deny each of you a loan on your own.  This works for them because either of you is responsible for the whole loan.  It works for him because he was already willing to be responsible for the whole loan.  And your alternative plan makes you responsible for the whole loan, so this is just as good for you.   At what percentage would you suggest splitting ownership and future expenses? Typically a cash/financing partnership would be 50/50, but since it\u2019s only a 3.5% down-payment instead of 20% is that still fair? Surprisingly enough, a 3.5% down-payment that accumulates is about half the equity of a 20% down-payment.  So your suggestion of a 25%-75% split makes sense if 20% would give a 50%-50% split.   I expected it to be considerably lower.  The way that I calculated it was to have his share increase by his equity share of the \"rent\" which I set to the principal plus interest payment for a thirty year loan.  With a 20% down-payment, this would give him 84% equity.  With 3.5%, about 40% equity.  I'm not sure why 84% equity should be the equivalent of a 50% share, but it may be a side effect of other expenses.  Perhaps taking property taxes out would reduce the equity share.   Note that if you increase the down-payment to 20%, your mortgage payment will drop substantially.  The difference in interest between 3.5% and 20% equity is a couple hundred dollars.  Also, you'll be able to eliminate any PMI payment at 20%.   It could be argued that if he pays a third of the monthly mortgage payment, that that would give him the same 50% equity stake on a 3.5% down-payment as he would get with a 20% down-payment.  The problem there is that then he is effectively subsidizing your monthly payment.  If he were to stop doing that for some reason, you'd have what is effectively a 50% increase in your rent.  It would be safer for you to handle the monthly payment while he handles the down-payment.   If you couldn't pay the mortgage, it sounds like he is in a position to buy out your equity, rent the property, and take over the mortgage payment.  If he stopped being able to pay his third of the mortgage, it's not evident that you'd be able to pick up the slack from him much less buy him out.  And it's unlikely that you'd find someone else willing to replace him under those terms.  But your brother could construct things such that in the face of tragedy, you'd inherit his equity in the house.  If you're making the entire mortgage payment, that's a stable situation.   He's not at risk because he could take over the mortgage if necessary.  You're not at risk because you inherit his equity share and can afford the monthly payment.  So even in the face of tragedy, things can go on.

A Starbucks would come with starting price of Rs 150. The same applies to food. A McBurger in India would be around Rs 100. The Indian equivalent Wada Pav is for Rs 10. A Sub Way would be Rs 150. A Equivalent Mumbai Sandwich around Rs 25.

PPP helps to adjust for these differences in prices and allows for a more accurate comparison of living standards between countries.There are several measures of PPP, including the \"Big Mac Index,\" which compares the price of a Big Mac burger in different countries as a way to compare the purchasing power of different currencies.

Just guessing, but I'll bet most of the reason is historical: Before up-to-the-moment quotes were readily available, that was a bit tedious to calculate/update the fund's value, so enacted-laws let it be done just once per day.  (@NL7 quotes the security act of 1940, which certainly has been updated, but also still might contain the results of crufty rationales, like this.) There are genuinely different issues between funds and stocks, though: One share of a fund is fundamentally different from one share of stock: There is a finite supply of Company-X-stock, and people are trading that piece of ownership around, and barter to find an mutually-agreeable-price.  But when you buy into a mutual-fund, the mutual-fund \"suddenly has more shares\" -- it takes your money and uses it to buy shares of the underlying stocks (in a ratio equal to its current holdings).  As a consequence: the mutual fund's price isn't determined by two people bartering and agreeing on a price (like stock); there is exactly one sane way to price a mutual fund, and that's the weighted total of its underlying stock.  If you wanted to sell your ownership-of-Mutual-Fund-Z to a friend at 2:34pm, there wouldn't be any bartering, you'd just calculate the value based on the stated-value of the underlying stock at that exact moment. So: there's no inherent reason you can't instantaneously price a mutual fund.  BUT people don't really buy/sell funds to each other -- they go to the fund-manager and essentially make a deposit-or-withdraw.  The fund-manager is only required by law to do it once a day (and perhaps even forbidden from doing it more often?), so that's all they do. [Disclaimer: I know very little about markets and finance.

They may be reluctant to do that because some people believe that could trigger an IRS audit. The reason is that independent contractor vs employee is supposed to be defined by your job function, not by your choice. If you were a contractor and then switched to be an employee without changing your job description, then the IRS could claim that you should have always been an employee the entire time, and so should every one of the other contractors that work for that company with a similar job function. It's a hornet's nest that the employer may not want to poke. But that's not your problem; what should you do about it? When you say \"he added my Federal and FICA W/H together\", do you mean that total appears in box 4 of your 1099? If so, it sounds like the employer is expecting you to re-pay the employer portion of FICA. Can you ask them if they actually paid it? If they did, then I don't see them having a choice but to issue a W2, since the IRS would be expecting one. If they didn't pay your FICA, then the amount this will cost you is 7.65% of what would have been your W2 wages. IMHO it would be reasonable for you to request that they send you a check for that extra amount. Note: even though that amount will be less than $600 and you won't receive a 1099 in 2017 for it, legally you'll still have to pay tax on that amount so I think a good estimate would be to call it 10% instead. Depending on your personality and your relationship with the employer, if they choose not to \"make you whole\", you could threaten to fill out form SS-8. Additional Info: (Thank you Bobson for bringing this up.) The situation you find yourself in is similar to the concept of \"Contract-to-Hire\". You start off as a contractor, and later convert to an employee. In order to avoid issuing a 1099 and W2 to the same person in a single tax year, companies typically utilize one of the following strategies: Your particular situation is closest to situation 2, but the reverse. Instead of retroactively calling you a W2 employee the entire time, your employer is cheating and attempting to classify you as a 1099 contractor the entire time.

Here are a few of their key recommendations:Start saving and investing early: One of the most important things you can do as a small investor is to start saving and investing as early as possible. This will give you more time for your money to grow and compound, increasing the potential for long-term success.Diversify your portfolio: Diversification is key to managing risk and reducing volatility in your investment portfolio. It's important to spread your money across different asset classes, sectors, and geographic regions to reduce the impact of any one investment on your overall portfolio.Look for companies with a competitive advantage: When evaluating potential investments, look for companies that have a durable competitive advantage, such as a strong brand, a unique product or service, or a loyal customer base. These companies are more likely to be successful in the long run.Stay focused on the long-term: It's important to have a long-term perspective when investing. Don't get too caught up in short-term fluctuations in the market, and try to avoid making impulsive decisions based on emotions.Keep your costs low: Finally, try to keep your costs as low as possible when investing. This includes minimizing fees, such as trading fees and mutual fund expense ratios, as well as taxes on your investment gains."}, {"label": 0, "content": "Its a new way of computing sales tax.

The tax would be applied uniformly to all new goods and services, with some exceptions for necessities such as food, clothing, and medical care. The Fair Tax would be collected by state and local governments, rather than by the federal government, and would be paid directly by consumers at the point of purchase.Proponents of the Fair Tax argue that it would simplify the tax system, reduce compliance costs, and increase economic growth by eliminating the disincentives to work and invest created by income and payroll taxes. They also argue that it would be more progressive than the current tax system because it would exempt low-income households from tax and impose a higher tax rate on higher-income households, who tend to consume more.However, critics of the Fair Tax argue that it would disproportionately burden lower- and middle-income households, who tend to spend a higher percentage of their income on consumption, and that it would be difficult to enforce and could lead to tax evasion. They also argue that it would be difficult to design the tax in a way that is both fair and revenue-neutral, and that it could lead to significant changes in the relative prices of different goods and services."}, {"label": 0, "content": "Successful covered calls are short term capital gains.

Long-term capital gains are taxed at a lower rate and apply to assets that you held for more than one year.If you sell the covered call option at a loss, that loss is considered a capital loss and can be used to offset capital gains you may have realized in other transactions during the year. If you have more capital losses than capital gains, you may be able to use the excess losses to reduce your taxable income by up to $3,000 in a given tax year.

The seller retains the legal title to the property until the contract is paid in full, at which point the title is transferred to the buyer.There are a few important things to consider when handling an owner-financed home sale:Clearly define the terms of the sale: It is important to have a written contract that clearly outlines the terms of the sale, including the purchase price, the amount and frequency of payments, and any penalties for late or missed payments.Protect your interests: As the seller, you will want to ensure that you are protected in the event the buyer defaults on their payments. This may include requiring the buyer to put down a deposit, or including a provision in the contract for the seller to retain a lien on the property until the contract is paid in full.Keep track of payments: It is important to keep track of payments made by the buyer and the remaining balance on the contract. This can be done manually or using software such as QuickBooks.Consider using an escrow service: An escrow service can help to ensure that the terms of the contract are followed and that both the buyer and seller are protected. The escrow service holds the funds from the sale and disburses them to the seller once the contract is paid in full.Overall, it is important to carefully consider the terms of an owner-financed home sale and to protect your interests as the seller.

My banker looked at my SCHUFA with me and we saw that there was nothing in there except for the credit card, which has a 500\u20ac limit and if I maxed it out, the monthly interest would be 6,80\u20ac so he added that 6,80\u20ac to my expenses calculation and that was it. If you're having trouble getting a loan and you don't know why, you can ask the SCHUFA for the data they have on you and you can correct any mistakes they might have made.

Also, it sounds like your friend is a tool. I hope this \"friend\" is not also your financial advisor... they would be encouraging you to make a very poor investment decision. They also don't know how to do financial math.  For what it's worth, I am not wrong. I have correctly answered a set of changing questions as you have asked them... Your friend is answering based on a third, completely different investment model, which you proposed in the edit to your last post. If that's what you meant all along, then you should have been more clear in the questions you were asking.  Please let me layout the following: How the previous questions//investment proposals were built How to analyze this current proposal What your other option is Why the other option is best in a 'real world' market The First Question My understanding of the initial proposal was to take out a $10,000 loan, invest the proceeds, and expect to not have any money of your own tied up in this. Because that OP did not specify that this is an interest-only loan (you still haven't in any of your questions), the bank will require you to make payments back to them each month that include principal and interest.  Your \"friend\" is talking about the total interest paid being the only cost of a loan. While that is (almost) true, regardless of what your friend says, significantly more cash is involved in making sure that all the payments are made on time---unless you set up an interest-only loan. But with the set up laid out in this post, and with the assumptions I specified there, the principal payments must be included because the borrower has to pay back the bank and isn't not tying up any of their own money.  In that case, my initial analysis is correct--your breakeven is in the low teens for an annual required return.  The Second Proposal Your second proposal... before any edits... refined things a little bit, to try to capture the any possible returns by not selling something. As I indicated there, (with what was an exaggerating assumption), the lack of clarity makes for an outlandish required return.  The Second Proposal...with edits, or the one proposed above I will get to the one proposed above in a second, but first let me highlight a few problems with your friend's analysis.  Simple interest: the only place (in the US at least) that will lend with simple interest is student loans. Any loan that you actually take out will be compound interest.  Not an interest only loan: your \"friend\" is not calculating interest correctly. Since this isn't an interest-only loan, the principal balance will reduce every time you make a payment, by ~$320-$340 each month. This substantially reduces the total interest paid, to $272.79 over the total 24 months.  \"Returns\": I don't know what country, or what business your friend works in, but \"returns\" are a very ambiguous concept. Investopedia defines returns as gains or losses. (I wish I could inhabit the lala land that your friend lives in when returns are always positive). TheFreeDictionary.com defines a return for finance as \"The change in the value of a portfolio over an evaluation period, including any distributions made from the portfolio during that period.\"  When you have not made it clear that any other money is being used in this investment plan (as was the case in scheme #1 and scheme #2a,) the loan still has to be paid. So, clearly the principal must be included in the return calculations.  How to evaluate this proposed investment scheme Key dimensions: Loan ($8,000 ... 24 months ... 0.27% monthly rate... monthly compounding... no loan origination fees) Monthly payment (PMT in Excel yields $344.70). Investment capital (starting = $8,000) Monthly Return (Investment yields... we hope it's positive!)  Your monthly contribution from your salary Taxes = 10%. Transaction Fees = $20  Go and lookup how to build an amortization table for a loan in Excel. Your life will be infinitely better for it.  Now, you get this loan set up and invested into something... (it costs $20 to buy the assets).  So you've got $7980 chugging away earning interest. I calculate that your break even, with you paying in $344.70 of your own money each month is 1.81% annually, or 3.42% over the 24 month life of this scheme. That is using monthly compound interest for the payments, because that's what the real world would use, and using monthly compounding of the investments' returns.  Your total interest expense would be $272.79.  This seems feasible. But let's talk about what your other option is, given that you're ready to spend $344.70 each month on an investment.  Your other option  I understand the appeal of getting $8,000... right away... to invest in something. But the risk behind this is that if the market goes down (and markets do) you're stuck paying a fixed amount for your loan that is now worth less money.  Your other option is to take your $344.70, and invest it step-by-step. (You would want to skip a month or two buying assets in the market, so that you can lessen transaction costs). This has two advantages: (1) you save yourself $272 in interest. (2) When the market goes down, you still win.  With this strategy, you still win when the market goes down because of what is commonly called \"dollar cost averaging\". When the market is up, your investments are also up. When the market goes down, your previous investments decrease in value but you can invest new money at the lower rates.  Why the step-by-step, invest your own money strategy is better At low rates (when you're looking for your break-even), the step-by-step model outperforms the loan. At higher rates of return (~4% + per year), you get the benefit of having the borrowed money earning more gains.  In fact, for every continuous (meaning set... not changing month-to-month) interest rate that you can dream up that is greater than about 4% per year, the borrowed money earns more.  At 10% per year, the borrowed money will earn about $500 more over the 2 years than your step by step investment would.  BUT I recognize that you might feel like the market will always go up. That's what everyone thinks. And that's alright.  But have one really bad month, or a couple of just-not-great-months, and your fixed 'loan' portfolio will underperform. Have a few really bad months, and your portfolio could be substantially reduced in value... but you would still be paying the same amount for it each month.  And if that happened (say your assets declined -3% in 3 of the 24 months...) You'd be losing money relative to the step-by-step portfolio."}, {"label": 1, "content": "It is generally not a good idea to take out a loan in order to invest.

As Dilip notes in his answer, in the US, they will likely apply the minimum payment to the lower rate balance, and then must apply the rest above the minimum to the higher rate balance.  In other countries, this will vary by law and custom.  Do not assume it will pay off the higher balance, or proportionally, without asking. Let's take the following example. You owe $6000.  $5000 is at 13.5% (normal purchase rate) and $1000 is at 22% (cash advance rate).  If your bank applies payments to both balances proportionally, then a payment of $600 will reduce your purchase balance by $500 and your cash advance balance by $100. The average APR, then, is simply sum of the product of the APR times balance.  So here, (.135*5000 + .225*1000)/6000 = 15%.  This is called a weighted average. If the bank applies the payment differently - such as to the lower rate first, or some specified part to the lower rate and the rest to the higher rate - then this will be misleading if you enter it into a calculator, because your average APR will rise over time as you pay off the purchase balance but don't pay off the cash advance balance, or may decrease if the opposite happens. The weighted average is probably reasonably close in the circumstance that you describe, even if you have rules applying the balance differently, so long as they don't 100% pay down the lower rate - so it may be the simplest option for you in terms of rough calculations (where it's not critical to be correct, just close). One approach using the online calculators that might be better, is to treat these like two separate loans/cards.  Many calculators exist for multiple balances.  Then you can allocate funds differently to the two 'cards'.  This would allow you to see how long you will need until you've paid off the higher balance, for example, although it probably won't perfectly match things - unless you find a site that has this specific option available you probably will have to either live with a small error in your calculations or do the math by hand."}, {"label": 1, "content": "To calculate the pay off for a credit card with multiple APRs, you will need to calculate the balance for each APR separately, then add them together to get the total balance. Here's how to do it:List all the APR rates and the corresponding balances for each rate.Calculate the minimum payment for each APR rate. To do this, multiply the balance by the APR rate, then divide by the number of months in a year (12). For example, if the balance is $1000 and the APR is 20%, the minimum payment would be $1000 * 20% / 12 = $166.67.Calculate the total minimum payment by adding the minimum payments for each APR rate.Calculate the total interest paid by subtracting the total minimum payment from the total balance.Repeat the process until the balance is paid off, making sure to pay the minimum payment for each APR rate each month.It's important to note that the above calculation assumes that you are only making the minimum payment and not paying more towards the balance. If you are able to pay more than the minimum payment each month, you will be able to pay off the balance more quickly and pay less in total interest.It's also a good idea to try to pay off the balances with the highest APR rates first, as they will accrue more interest over time.

When capital gains and losses are reported from the tax return, the taxpayer must first categorize all gains and losses between long and short term, and then aggregate the sum total amounts for every single regarding the four categories. Then the gains that are long-term losses are netted against each other, therefore the same is done for short-term gains and losses. Then your net gain that is long-term loss is netted against the net short-term gain or loss. This final net number is then reported on Form 1040. Example Frank has the following gains and losses from his stock trading for the year: Short-term gains - $6,000 Long-term gains - $4,000 Short-term losses - $2,000 Long-term losses - $5,000 Net short-term gain/loss - $4,000 ST gain ($6,000 ST gain - $2,000 ST loss) Net long-term gain/loss - $1,000 LT loss ($4,000 LT gain - $5,000 LT loss) Final net gain/loss - $3,000 short-term gain ($4,000 ST gain - $1,000 LT loss)   Again, Frank can only deduct $3,000 of final net short- or long-term losses against other types of income for that year and must carry forward any remaining balance."}, {"label": 1, "content": "Yes, it is possible to use a tax loss to offset capital gains taxes. In the United States, if you sell an asset for a gain, you may have to pay capital gains tax on the profit you made from the sale. If you sell an asset for a loss, you may be able to use that loss to offset capital gains taxes you owe from selling other assets.To use a tax loss to offset capital gains taxes, you would need to first calculate your total capital gains for the year. If you have any capital losses, you can then use those losses to offset your capital gains dollar for dollar. For example, if you have $10,000 in capital gains and $5,000 in capital losses, you can use the $5,000 loss to offset the $10,000 in gains, so you would only owe capital gains tax on $5,000 of profit.It is important to note that you can only use capital losses to offset capital gains. If you have more capital losses than capital gains, you may be able to use the excess losses to offset other types of income, up to a maximum of $3,000 per year.

UNLESS they get cosigned. This means that even if you have $2000, no broker will give you margin unless you have a (good) credit history already. There was a good reason for this, but its based on the assumption that everyone is stupid, not the assumption that some people are objective thinkers. 3) The brokers that will open an account for you have high commissions. The commissions are so high that it will destroy any capital gains you may make with your $1000. For the most part. 4) The pattern day trader rule. You cannot employ sophisticated risk management while being subject to the pattern day trader rule. It basically limits you from trading 3 times a day (its more complicated than that read it yourself) if you have less than $25,000 in one account. 5) Non-trade or stock related investments: Buy municipal or treasury bonds. They will give you more than a savings account would, and municipals are tax free. This isn't exactly what I would call liquid though - ie. if you wanted to access your money to invest in something else on a whim. 6) What are you studying?

He might do this with one $200 pair of tennis shoes, and then use the $60 profit different to go buy video games for himself. If he wanted to scale up, he couldn't because he never has more than $200 to play with. In comparison, you could do 5 pairs ($200 x 5) and immediately have a larger operation than him, making a larger profit ($60 x 5 = $300, now you have $1300 and could do it again with 6 pairs to make an even great er profit) not because you are better or worked at it, but solely because you have more capital to start with. Keep an eye out for arbitrage opportunities, usually there is a good reason they exist if you notice it: the market is too small and illiquid to scale up with, or the entire market will be saturated the next day.

Putting a single large block of stock up for sale is problematic for one simple reason: Let's say you have 100,000 shares of a stock, and for some reason you decide today is the day to sell them, take your profits, and ride off into the sunset.  So you call your broker (or log into your brokerage account) and put them up for sale.  He puts in an order somewhere, the stock is sold, and your account is credited. Seems simple, right?  Well...not so fast. Professionals - I'm keeping this simple, so please don't beat me up for it! The way stocks are bought and sold is through companies known as \"market makers\".  These are entities which sit between the markets and you (and your broker), and when you want to buy or sell a stock, most of the time the order is ultimately handled somewhere along the line by a market maker.  If you work with a large brokerage firm, sometimes they'll buy or sell your shares out of their own accounts, but that's another story. It is normal for there to be many, sometimes hundreds, of market makers who are all trading in the same equity.  The bigger the stock, the more market makers it attracts.  They all compete with each other for business, and they make their money on the spread between what they buy stock from people selling for and what they can get for it selling it to people who want it. Given that there could be hundreds of market makers on a particular stock (Google, Apple, and Microsoft are good examples of having hundreds of market makers trading in their stocks), it is very competitive.  The way the makers compete is on price.  It might surprise you to know that it is the market makers, not the markets, that decide what a stock will buy or sell for. Each market maker sets their own prices for what they'll pay to buy from sellers for, and what they'll sell it to buyers for.  This is called, respectively, the \"bid\" and the \"ask\" prices.  So, if there are hundreds of market makers then there could be hundreds of different bid and ask prices on the same stock.  The prices you see for stocks are what are called the \"best bid and best ask\" prices.  What that means is, you are being shown the highest \"bid\" price (what you can sell your shares for) and the best \"ask\" price (what you can buy those shares for) because that's what is required.  That being said, there are many other market makers on the same stock whose bid prices are lower and ask prices are higher.  Many times there will be a big clump of market makers all at the same bid/ask, or within fractions of a cent of each other, all competing for business.  Trading computers are taught to seek out the best prices and the fastest trade fills they can. The point to this very simplistic lesson is that the market makers set the prices that shares trade at.  They adjust those prices based (among other factors) on how much buying and selling volume they're seeing.  If they see a wave of sell orders coming into the system then they'll start marking down their bid prices.  This keeps them from paying too much for shares they're going to have to find a buyer for eventually, and it can sometimes slow down the pace of selling as investors and automated systems notice the price decline and decide to wait to sell.  Conversely, if market makers see a wave of buy orders coming into the system, they'll start marking their ask prices up to maximize their gains, since they're selling you shares they bought from someone else, presumably at a lower price.  But they typically adjust their prices up or down before they actually fill trades.  (sneaky, eh?) Depending on how much volume there is on the shares of the company you're selling, and depending on whether there are more buyers than sellers at the moment, your share sell order may be filled at market by a market maker with no real consequence to the share's price. If the block is large enough then it's possible it will not all sell to one market maker, or it might not all happen in one transaction or even all at the same price.

If there are not enough buyers willing to absorb this additional supply, the price of the stock may decrease as sellers reduce their asking prices in order to attract buyers.However, it is also important to note that stock prices are influenced by a wide range of factors, including economic conditions, company performance, and market sentiment.

I'll assume that you have the other 10% in bonds. For the sake of simplicity, I'll assume that your investments in stocks are in nice, passive indexed mutual funds and ETFs, rather than in individual stocks. A 90% allocation in stocks is considered aggressive. The problem is that if the stock market crashes, you may lose 40% or more of your investment in a single year. As you point out, you are investing for the long term. That's great, it means you can rest easy if the stock market crashes, safe in the hope that you have many years for it to recover. So long as you have the emotional willpower to stick with it. Would you be better off with a 100% allocation in stocks? You'd think so, wouldn't you. After all, the stock market as a whole gives better expected returns than the bond market. But keep in mind, the stock market and the bond market are (somewhat) negatively correlated. That means when the stock market goes down, the bond market often goes up, and vice versa. Investing some of your money in bonds will slightly reduce your expected return but will also reduce your standard deviation and your maximum annual loss. Canadian Couch Potato has an interesting write-up on how to estimate stock and bond returns. It's based on your stocks being invested equally in the Canadian, U.S., and international markets. As you live in the U.S., that likely doesn't directly apply to you; you probably ignore the Canadian stock market, but your returns will be fairly similar. I've reproduced part of that table here: As you can see, your expected return is highest with a 100% allocation in stocks. With a 20 year window, you likely can recover from any crash. If you have the stomach for it, it's the allocation with the highest expected return. Once you get closer to retirement, though, you have less time to wait for the stock market to recover. If you still have 90% or 100% of your investment in stocks and the market crashes by 44%, it might well take you more than 6 years to recover. Canadian Couch Potato has another article, Does a 60/40 Portfolio Still Make Sense? A 60/40 portfolio is a fairly common split for regular investors. Typically considered not too aggressive, not too conservative. The article references an AP article that suggests, in the current financial climate, 60/40 isn't enough. Even they aren't recommending a 90/10 or a 100/0 split, though. Personally, I think 60/40 is too conservative. However, I don't have the stomach for a 100/0 split or even a 90/10 split. Okay, to get back to your question. So long as your time horizon is far enough out, the expected return is highest with a 100% allocation in stocks. Be sure that you can tolerate the risk, though. A 30% or 40% hit to your investments is enough to make anyone jittery. Investing a portion of your money in bonds slightly lowers your expected return but can measurably reduce your risk. As you get closer to retirement and your time horizon narrows, you have less time to recover from a stock market crash and do need to be more conservative. 6 years is probably too short to keep all your money in stocks. Is your stated approach reasonable? Well, only you can answer that. :)"}, {"label": 1, "content": "As people age, their risk tolerance tends to decrease.

The extra returns on 100% stocks vs. 60% are 1.2% per year (historically) according to https://personal.vanguard.com/us/insights/saving-investing/model-portfolio-allocations To get those average higher stock returns, you need to be thinking 20-30 years (even 10 years is too short-term). Over the 20-30 years, you must never panic and go to cash, or you will destroy the higher returns. You must never get discouraged and stop saving, or you will destroy the higher returns. You have to avoid the panic and discouragement despite the likelihood that some 10-year period in your 20-30 years the stock market will go nowhere. You also must never have an emergency or other reason to withdraw money early. If you look at \"dry periods\" in stocks, like 2000 to 2011, a 60/40 portfolio made significant money and stocks went nowhere. A diversified portfolio means that price volatility makes you money (due to rebalancing) while a 100% stocks portfolio means that price volatility is just a lot of stress with no benefit. It's somewhat possible, probably, to predict dry periods in stocks; if I remember the statistics, about 50% of the variability in the market price 10 years out can be explained by normalized market valuation (normalized = adjusted for business cycle and abnormal profit margins). Some funds such as http://hussmanfunds.com/ are completely based on this, though a lot of money managers consider it. With a balanced portfolio and rebalancing, though, you don't have to worry about it very much. In my view, the proper goal is not to beat the market, nor match the market, nor is it to earn the absolute highest possible returns. Instead, the goal is to have the highest chance of financing your non-financial goals (such as retirement, or buying a house). To maximize your chances of supporting your life goals with your financial decisions, predictability is more important than maximized returns. Your results are primarily determined by your savings rate - which realistic investment returns will never compensate for if it's too low. You can certainly make a 40-year projection in which 1.2% difference in returns makes a big difference. But you have to remember that a projection in which value steadily and predictably compounds is not the same as real life, where you could have emergency or emotional factors, where the market will move erratically and might have a big plunge at just the wrong time (end of the 40 years), and so on. If your plan \"relies\" on the extra 1.2% returns then it's not a reasonable plan anyhow, in my opinion, since you can't count on them.

These funds offer investors a convenient and low-cost way to diversify their portfolio by holding a broad range of stocks, rather than having to invest in individual stocks themselves.One of the main advantages of index funds is that they offer broad diversification, which can help to mitigate risk and smooth out returns over time.

If the market price falls within your specified range, your order will be executed at the best available price. If the market price goes above or below your specified range, your order will not be executed.For example, let's say that you want to buy shares of XYZ stock, but you are only willing to pay between $50 and $60 per share. You could place a \"limit order with a range\" to buy XYZ stock at a minimum price of $50 and a maximum price of $60. If the market price of XYZ stock falls within that range, your order will be executed at the best available price within the range. If the market price goes above $60 or below $50, your order will not be executed.It's worth noting that limit orders with a range may not be available on all exchanges or with all brokers, and they may not always be supported for all types of securities.

It is based on the principle that every financial transaction has two equal and opposite effects on a company's financial statements. This means that for every debit (expense) recorded in one account, there must be a corresponding credit (income) recorded in another account. The purpose of double-entry accounting is to ensure the accuracy and completeness of a company's financial records by requiring that every transaction be recorded in at least two accounts.Here is a basic tutorial on double-entry accounting for personal finance:Set up a chart of accounts. A chart of accounts is a list of all the accounts that a company uses to record its financial transactions. In personal finance, this might include accounts for cash, investments, liabilities (such as credit card debt), and assets (such as a house or car).Record transactions in the appropriate accounts. When you make a financial transaction, such as paying a bill or receiving a paycheck, you will need to record it in the appropriate accounts in your chart of accounts. For example, if you pay a bill, you would debit the expense account (such as \"utilities\") and credit the cash account.Prepare financial statements. Using the information recorded in your chart of accounts, you can prepare financial statements such as a balance sheet and an income statement. A balance sheet shows the financial position of a company at a specific point in time, including its assets, liabilities, and equity. An income statement shows a company's revenues and expenses over a specific period of time, such as a month or a year.Reconcile your accounts. To ensure the accuracy of your financial records, it is important to regularly reconcile your accounts. This involves comparing the balance in your chart of accounts to your bank statement or other records to make sure everything matches. If there are any discrepancies, you will need to investigate and make any necessary adjustments.Double-entry accounting can seem intimidating at first, but with practice it can be a powerful tool for managing your personal finances and ensuring the accuracy of your financial records."}, {"label": 0, "content": "First thing to consider is that getting your hands on an IPO is very difficult unless you have some serious clout.

What if a you want to spend some time with a relative or significant other who learns they only have a few months to live? Having a dedicated emergency fund is an important way to avoid downside risk. 2) Lagerbaer has a good suggestion. Given that if you'd reinvested your dividends, the S&P 500 has returned about 3.5% over the last 5 years, you may be able to get a very nice risk-free return.  3) Do you have access to employer matching funds, such as in a 401(k) at work? If you get a dollar-for-dollar match, that is a risk-free pre-tax 100% return and should be a high priority. 4) What do you mean by \"medium\" volatility? Given that you are considering a 2/3 equity allocation, it would not be at all out of the realm of possibility that your balance could fall by 15% or more in any given year and take several years to recover. If that would spook you, you may want to consider lowering your equity weights. A high quality bond fund may be a good fit. 5) Personally, I would avoid putting money into stocks that I didn't need back for 10 years. If you only want to tie your money up for 2-5 years, you are taking a significant risk that if prices fall, you won't have time to recover before you need your money back. The portfolio you described would be appropriate for someone with a long-term investment horizon and significant risk tolerance, which is usually the case for young people saving for retirement. However, if your goals are to invest for 2-5 years only, your situation would be significantly different.  6) You can often borrow from an investment account to purchase a primary residence, but you must pay that amount back in order to avoid significant taxes and fees, unless you plan to liquidate assets. If you plan to buy a house, saving enough to avoid PMI is a good risk-free return on your money. 7) In general, and ETF or index fund is a good idea, the key being to minimize the compound effect of expenses over the long term. There are many good choices a la Vanguard here to choose from. 8) Don't worry about \"Buy low, sell high\". Don't be a speculator, be an investor (that's my version of Anthony Bourdain's, \"don't be a tourist, be a traveler\"). A speculator wants to sell shares at a higher price than they were purchased at. An investor wants to share in the profits of a company as a part-owner. If you can consistently beat the market by trying to time your transactions, good for you - you can move to Wall Street and make millions. However, almost no one can do this consistently, and it doesn't seem worth it to me to try. I don't mean to discourage you from investing, just make sure you have your bases covered so that you don't have to cash out at a bad time. Best of luck! Edit Response to additional questions below. 1) Emergency fund. I would recommend not investing in anything other than cash equivalents (money market, short-term CDs, etc.) until you've built up an emergency fund. It makes sense to want to make the \"best\" use of your money, but you also have to account for risk. My concern is that if you were to experience one or more adverse life events, that you could lose a lot of money, or need to pay a lot in interest on credit card debt, and it would be prudent to self-insure against some of those risks. I would also recommend against using an investment account as an emergency fund account. Taking money out of investment accounts is inefficient because the commissions/taxes/fees can easily eat up a significant portion of your returns. Ideally, you would want to put money in and not touch it for a long time in order to take advantage of compounding returns. There are also high penalties for early disbursements from retirement funds. Just like you need enough money in your checking account to buy food and pay the rent every month, you need enough money in an emergency fund to pay for things that are a real possibility, even if they are less common. Using a credit card or an investment account is a relatively expensive way to do this. 2) Invest at all? I would recommend starting an emergency fund, and then beginning to invest for retirement.

Do you want to save for retirement, for a down payment on a home, or for some other financial goal? Having clear goals will help you make investment decisions that align with your financial plans.Assess your risk tolerance: Different investments carry different levels of risk. It is important to choose investments that are appropriate for your risk tolerance. If you are a more conservative investor, you may want to choose investments with lower levels of risk, such as bonds or funds that invest in blue-chip stocks. If you are a more aggressive investor, you may be willing to accept higher levels of risk in exchange for the potential for higher returns.Determine your asset allocation: Your asset allocation is the mix of different types of assets in your portfolio. A common approach is to allocate a portion of your portfolio to stocks, a portion to bonds, and a portion to cash or other short-term investments. A well-diversified portfolio typically includes a mix of assets across different asset classes, such as domestic and international stocks, different types of bonds (e.g., corporate, government, municipal), and cash or other short-term investments.Choose specific investments: Once you have a sense of your investment goals, risk tolerance, and asset allocation, you can begin choosing specific investments for your portfolio. Some options may include individual stocks, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and index funds.Review and rebalance your portfolio: As your financial situation or goals change, it is important to review and adjust your portfolio as needed.

First, it helps to ensure that there is a stable and trustworthy source of fiat money in circulation. If commercial banks were able to print their own money, it could lead to an increase in the money supply, which could lead to inflation. Second, central banks are typically more financially stable and have better access to resources such as printing technology, making them better equipped to handle the production and distribution of paper currency.In some cases, commercial banks may be allowed to issue their own paper currency, but this is typically only done in limited circumstances and is subject to strict regulations.

First things first, there is not enough information here to give you an answer.  When discussing life insurance, the very first things we need to fully consider are the illustration of policy values, and the contract itself.  Without these, there is no way to tell if this is a good idea or not. So what are the things to look for? A. Risk appetite.  People love to discuss projections of the market, like for example, \"7-8% a year compounded annually\".  Go look at the historical returns of the stock market.  It is never close to that projection.  Life insurance, however, can give you a GUARANTEED return (this would be show in the 'Guaranteed' section of the life insurance illustration).  As long as you pay your premiums, this money is guaranteed to accrue.  Now most life insurance companies also show 'Non-Guaranteed' elements in their illustrations - these are non-guaranteed projections based on a scale at this point in time.  These columns will show how your cash value may grow when dividends are credited to your policy (and used to buy paid-up additional insurance, which generates more dividends - this can be compared to the compounding nature of interest).   B. Tax treatment.  I am definitely not an expert in this area, but life insurance does have preferential tax treatment, particularly to your beneficiaries. C. Beneficiaries.  Any death benefit (again, listed as guaranteed and maybe non-guaranteed values) is generally completely tax free for the beneficiary. D. Strategy.  Tying all of this together, what exactly is the point of this?  To transfer wealth, to accrue wealth, or some combination thereof?  This is important and unstated in your question. So again, without knowing more, there is no way to answer your question.  But I am surprised that in this forum, so many people are quick to jump in and say in general that whole life insurance is a scam.  And even more surprising is the fact the accepted answer has already been accepted. My personal take is that if you are just trying to accrue wealth, you should probably stick to the market and maybe buy term if you want a death benefit component.  This is mostly due to your age (higher risk of death = higher premiums = lower buildup) and how long of a time period you have to build up money in the policy.

Do you have any outstanding debts or other financial obligations that need to be addressed? Answering these questions can help you determine whether a whole life insurance policy is a good fit for your situation.Your current and future financial resources: Do you have other assets, such as a retirement account or savings, that can be used to meet your financial needs and goals? If you have sufficient resources, you may not need the additional protection provided by a whole life insurance policy.Your current and future health status: Life insurance premiums are typically based on your age and overall health, so if you are in good health, you may be able to secure a lower premium on a whole life insurance policy. However, if you have pre-existing health conditions or are at an advanced age, you may be more likely to be denied coverage or face higher premiums.It's a good idea to speak with a financial professional who can help you evaluate your specific situation and determine whether a whole life insurance policy is the right choice for you.

However, a more effective way is to actually look at price action itself. The definition of an uptrend is higher highs followed by higher lows. The definition of a downtrend is lower lows followed by lower highs. So if you are looking to invest for the long term you can look at the weekly or even the monthly chart of the market say over the past 10, 15 or 20 years. Using these definitions on say the S&P500 if the price continues to make higher highs and higher lows then stay in the market. If the price makes a lower high than the previous high, then this is a warning sign that the trend may be about to end. The trend has not broken yet but it is a warning sign that it could be ending soon. If the price makes a higher low next followed by a higher high, then the trend continues and you just need to keep an eye on things. If, however, the price makes a lower low after the lower high this is a signal that the uptrend is over and you should get out of the market. If the price makes a lower low directly after a higher high, then be cautious and wait for confirmation that the uptrend is over. If you then get a lower high this is confirmation that the uptrend is over, you would then sell if prices drop below the previous low.

The index chart will give you an indication if the uptrend is over for the whole market, then you can be more cautious in regards to the individual shares.

You can then buy back into the market when you determine that the downtrend is broken and prices start to show higher highs and higher lows again.

If I have a high time preference then I prefer money in my hand versus money promised to me at some date in the future.  Thus, I will only loan my money to someone if they offer me an incentive which would be an amount of money to be received in the future that is larger than the amount of money I\u2019m giving the debtor in the present (i.e. the interest rate). Many factors go into my time preference determination.  My demand for cash (i.e. my cash balance), the credit rating of the borrower, the length of the loan, and my expectation of the change in currency value are just a few of the factors that affect what interest rate I will loan money. The first loan I make will have a lower interest rate than the last loan, ceteris paribus.  This is because my supply of cash diminishes with each loan which makes my remaining cash more valuable and a higher interest rate will be needed to entice me to make additional loans.  This is the theory behind why interest rates will rise when QE3 or QEinfinity ever stops.  QE is where the Federal Reserve cartel prints new money to purchase bonds from cartel banks.  If QE slows or ends the supply of money will stop increasing which will make cash more valuable and higher interest rates will be needed to entice creditors to loan money. Note that increasing the stock of money does not necessarily result in lower interest rates.  As stated earlier, the change in value of the currency also affects the interest rate lenders are willing to accept.  If the Federal Reserve cartel deposited $1 million everyday into every US citizen\u2019s bank account it wouldn\u2019t take long before lenders demanded very high interest rates as compensation for the decrease in the value of the currency. Does the Federal Reserve cartel affect interest rates?  Yes, in two ways.  First, as mentioned before, it prints new money that is loaned to the government.  It either purchases the bonds directly or purchases the bonds from cartel banks which give them cash to purchase more government bonds.  This keeps demand high for government bonds which lowers the yield on government bonds (yields move inverse to the price of the bond).  The Federal Reserve cartel also can provide an unlimited amount of funds at the Federal Funds rate to the cartel member banks.  Banks can borrow at this rate and then proceed to make loans at a higher rate and pocket the difference. Remember, however, that the Federal Reserve cartel is not the only market participant.  Other bond holders, such as foreign governments and pension funds, buy and sell US bonds.  At some point they could demand higher rates.  The Federal Reserve cartel, which currently holds close to 17% of US public debt, could attempt to keep rates low by printing new money to buy all existing US bonds to prevent the yield on bonds from going up.  At that point, however, holding US dollars becomes very dangerous as it is apparent the Federal Reserve cartel is just a money printing machine for the US government.

On the other hand, when the economy is weak and there is less demand for credit, interest rates may be lower as lenders try to encourage borrowing and stimulate economic activity.Inflation, or the general increase in prices over time, can also affect interest rates. If the rate of inflation is high, the central bank (such as the Federal Reserve in the United States) may choose to raise interest rates in order to reduce the supply of money in circulation and help curb inflation. Conversely, if the rate of inflation is low, the central bank may lower interest rates to encourage borrowing and stimulate economic growth.There are many other factors that can influence interest rates as well, such as the stability of the financial system, the level of government debt, and the overall level of risk in the economy."}, {"label": 0, "content": "Having an EIN does not make the LLC a corporation -- your business can have an EIN even when treated like a sole proprietorship.

This can reduce your taxable income and lower your tax bill.Property tax deduction: You may also be able to claim a deduction for the property taxes you pay on your condominium. This can also reduce your taxable income and lower your tax bill.Capital gains exclusion: If you sell your condominium for a profit, you may be able to exclude a portion of the gain from your taxable income if you meet certain requirements. For example, if you are single, you may be able to exclude up to $250,000 of gain from the sale of your primary residence. If you are married and filing jointly, you may be able to exclude up to $500,000 of gain.1031 exchange: If you are planning to sell your condominium and purchase another investment property, you may be able to defer the tax on the sale of your condominium by using a 1031 exchange. Under a 1031 exchange, you can sell your condominium and purchase another investment property without paying taxes on the sale of the original property.It's important to note that these tax strategies have specific requirements and limitations, so you should consult with a tax professional or refer to IRS guidelines to determine how they may apply to your situation."}, {"label": 0, "content": "I think there's a measure of confirmation bias here.

Combine that with the fact that you are considering only two assets and you can easily have a solution where only one asset is desired in the portfolio.  The fact that you describe the US fund as \"dominating\" the forign fund indicates that this may be the case for you.  Ordinarily diversification benefits the overall portfolio even if one asset \"dominates\" another but it may not in your special case. Notice that these funds are both already highly diversified, so all you are getting is cross-border diversification by getting more than one.  That may be why you are getting the solution you are.  I've seen a lot of suggested allocations that have weights similar to what you are using. Finding an optimal portfolio given a vector of expected returns and a covariance matrix is very easy, with some reliable results.  Fancy models get pretty much the same kinds of answers as simple ones.  However, getting a good covariance matrix is hard and getting a good expected return vector is all but impossible.  Unfortunately portfolio results are very sensitive to these inputs.  For that reason, most of us use portfolio theory to guide our intuition, but seldom do the math for our own portfolio.  In any model you use, your weak link is the expected return and covariance.  More sophisticated models don't usually help produce a more reasonable result.

Some factors to consider when determining your asset allocation include your age, time horizon, risk tolerance, and financial goals.For example, younger investors who have a longer time horizon may be able to take on more risk in their portfolio, as they have more time to recover from market fluctuations. As such, they may choose to allocate a larger portion of their portfolio to stocks, which have the potential for higher returns but also come with more volatility.On the other hand, older investors or those who are nearing retirement may have a lower risk tolerance and may want to allocate a larger portion of their portfolio to more stable investments, such as bonds or cash.It is important to periodically review and rebalance your asset allocation to ensure that it aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.

I'm not quite sure what you're asking. Where does the money come from? When someone starts a bank, they normally get together a bunch of investors -- perhaps people they know personally, perhaps they sell stock -- to raise initial capital. But most of the money in the bank comes from depositors. Fundamentally, what a bank does is take money from depositors and loan it to borrowers. (Banks also borrow money from other banks and from the government.) They charge the borrowers interest on the loan, and they pay depositors interest on their deposits. The difference between those two interest rates is where the bank gets their profit. Where does the money go when you pay it back? As mhoran_psprep said, some of it goes to pay interest to the depositors; some of it goes to pay the bank's expenses like employee salaries, cost of the building, etc; and some of it goes as profit to the owners or stockholders of the bank. If you're thinking, \"Wow, I'm paying back a whole lot more than I borrowed\", well, yes. But remember you're borrowing that money for 20 or 30 years.

All-wheel drive is better at getting you moving from a stop if one of the drive wheels would otherwise be slipping. It makes less difference during actual driving.  Traction control braking is much more important -- and much more common, hence much cheaper. And probably already present in your Camry. And good tires make a huge difference.

Brand: There are generally two levels of pricing: \"major brand\" and \"discount brand\". You can generally expect the \"discount brand\" to cost about 5-10 cents less per gallon in the same neighborhood as \"major brand\" gas. This is for a number of sub-factors; chief among them is that not all gasolines are created equal. A lot of the major brands (Shell, Texaco, Chevron, BP, Exxon) have proprietary detergents and cleaning agents that the discount brands do not. They're also generally closer to the real octane rating of the gas, have less ethanol (you'll see the sign that says \"contains up to 10% ethanol\"; the bargain brands are right up at that limit while the top-tier brands keep it lower) and have stricter requirements about storage tank maintenance. Anyone who tells you that all gas is the same, send em my way; I tried to save a few bux buying the cheaper stuff and now my car needs an engine overhaul because of fouling causing premature wear. A couple of my co-workers got a fuel system overhaul free from the local supermarket because the storage tank wasn't properly purged, and they got water into their gas tanks. Market Price: Yes, this is of course a factor. Generally, gas prices at the pump rise very quickly when the market price of crude or gasoline goes up, then fall more slowly than the market price, because the margins on gas sales for a C-store are very slim. When prices change, the C-stores lose either way; when prices rise they have to pay more than they got from the last tankful to buy the next one, and when prices fall they don't recoup the cost of their current tank. By quickly increasing the price to match commodities market prices, then gradually lowering them over time even if the market collapses, they mitigate the losses both ways. Overhead: A gas station right next to a highway probably had to pay more for that land, both to buy/lease it and in property taxes. Nicer (newer, cleaner) stations generally have to pay more to stay that way. The higher your operating costs, the more you'll have to charge for your gas. You can usually do so because the nicer station will attract customers willing to pay a few cents more for the nicer facilities. Taxation: Most States charge a tax on gasoline, in addition to a Federal tax on gas. That revenue either goes into the State's general fund, or is earmarked for transportation costs like road maintenance. California's gas prices are sky-high across the state, because they have the highest gas tax. I'm not sure Colorado, Wyoming and Montana have gas taxes at all. Proximity to other stations: No matter what you have to pay for the land and facilities, if there's another station across the street, you have to be within a penny of their price or people will vote with their feet. While \"predatory pricing\" (taking a loss on sales in one area, buffered by profits elsewhere, in order to drive out competition) is technically illegal, you see it all the time in the C-store industry and it is very difficult to prove. This is a primary cause of neighborhood-to-neighborhood changes; a C-store will look around the other stations on their street corner, and the ones down the road a block or two each direction, when determining what they can sell gas for that day. The guy five blocks down has a completely different pool of competing stations. Population Distribution: With a lot of people in a particular area, there's a big \"pie\" of customer dollars for C-stores to compete for. This generally leads to increased prices because the stations don't have to be AS cutthroat; regardless of how good your price is, you have only so many pumps, and at some point people will pay more to use the open pump than wait for the cheaper one. The reverse is true in rural areas; with only two stations in an entire small town, those two stations will become extremely cutthroat. However, rural prices also vary more; with only one station in easy walking distance from where you ran out of gas, they can charge you $6 to fill that gallon gas can if they want, and you'll pay it because the next gas station's another 20 miles down the road and probably has even higher prices. This, along with overhead, is generally why the Rockies states have the lowest average prices; land's cheap and people are scarce in Wyoming. But, the \"price-gouging\" can be seen in the rural Southwest, where there's a LOT of ground to cover between gas stations, and so the \"last chance gas\" along major highways just outside of town, each a nickel to a dime more than the previous station, is a common stereotype. Transportation costs: Prices are higher on the East and West Coasts than in the Gulf States for a very simple reason; the bulk of the U.S. refinery capacity is along the Gulf Coast between Galveston and the Florida border. The further you are from there, the more it costs to get the fuel from the refinery to the gas station, and that cost is reflected at the pump. In fact, the East Coast imports gasoline by tanker even though the United States is now a net exporter of gasoline, because it's cheaper to buy it from foreign sources than it would be to watch it drip through the limited pipeline capacity that exists between the Gulf states and the Eastern Seaboard."}, {"label": 1, "content": "There are a number of factors that can contribute to the price differences you may see among gas stations in the same local area. Some of the most common reasons include:Competition: Gas stations often adjust their prices based on the competition in their local area. If there are a number of gas stations in close proximity to one another, they may all be competing for the same customers and may adjust their prices accordingly.Location: Gas stations that are located in areas with higher demand, such as near a highway or in a densely populated city, may be able to charge higher prices because there is more demand for their products.Cost of transportation: Gas stations that are located farther from the source of their fuel may incur higher transportation costs, which may be reflected in the price of their gasoline.Brand reputation: Some gas stations are associated with a particular brand or chain, and these brands may have different pricing strategies or pricing agreements with their suppliers.Quality of gasoline: Some gas stations offer higher-quality gasoline that may be more expensive to produce, but that may also be more attractive to customers who are willing to pay a premium for a higher-quality product.Taxes: Gasoline prices can also be affected by the taxes that are applied to them by local, state, and federal governments. These taxes may vary depending on the location of the gas station."}, {"label": 0, "content": "Many states have a simple method for assessing income tax on nonresidents.  If you have $X income in State A where you claim nonresident status and  $Y income overall, then you owe State A a fraction (X/Y) of the income  tax that would have been due on $Y income had you been a resident of State A.  In other words, compute the state income tax on $Y as per State A rules, and send us (X/Y) of that amount.  If you are a resident of State B, then State B  will tax you on $Y but give you some credit for taxes paid to State A. Thus, you might be required to file a State A income tax return regardless of how small $X is.  As a practical matter, many commercial real-estate  investments are set up as limited partnerships in which most of the annual taxable income is a small amount of portfolio income (usually interest income that you report on Schedule B of Form 1040), and the annual  bottom line is lots of passive losses which the limited partners report (but do not get to deduct) on the Federal return.  As a result, State A is unlikely to come after you for the tax on, say, $100 of interest income each year because it will cost them more to go after you than they will  recover from you. But, when the real estate is sold, there will (hopefully) be a big capital gain, most of which  will be sheltered from Federal tax since the passive losses finally get  to be deducted.  At this point, State A is not only owed a lot of money (it knows nothing of your passive losses etc) but, after it processes the income tax return that you filed for that year, it will likely demand that you file income tax returns for previous years as well."}, {"label": 1, "content": "In Arizona, gross income refers to all income received or earned during the taxable year, before any deductions or exemptions have been taken.

Investors have so far paid little attention to   intangibles, but as write-downs proliferate they are likely to become   increasingly wary of industries with a high ratio of goodwill to   assets, such as health care, consumer goods and telecoms. How bad things get will depend on the beancounters. American firms   used to be allowed to amortise goodwill over many years. Since 2002,   when an accounting-rule change ended that practice, goodwill has had   to be tested every year for impairment. In this stormy environment,   with auditors keener than ever to avoid being seen to go easy on   clients, companies are being told to mark down assets if there is any   doubt about their value. The sanguine point out that this has no effect on cashflow, since such   charges are non-cash items. Moreover, some investors take goodwill   write-offs with a pinch of salt, preferring to look past such   non-recurring costs and accept the higher \u201cnormalised\u201d earnings   numbers to which managers understandably cling. The largest companies   are thus able to survive thumping blows that might otherwise floor   them, such as the $99 billion loss that the newly formed but   ill-conceived AOL Time Warner, as it then was, reported for 2002. But   the impact can be all too real, as write-downs reduce overall book   value and increase leverage ratios, a particular concern in these   debt-averse times."}, {"label": 1, "content": "Goodwill is an intangible asset that represents the excess of the purchase price of a company over the fair market value of its tangible assets and liabilities. It is typically recorded on the balance sheet when a company acquires another company at a price that is higher than the fair market value of its net tangible assets.There are several forces that can cause a company to write down goodwill, including:Impairment: If the fair market value of a company's assets and liabilities decreases significantly, the company may need to write down the value of its goodwill. This can be caused by a variety of factors, such as changes in market conditions, changes in the industry in which the company operates, or changes in the company's financial performance.Restructuring: If a company undergoes a restructuring, such as a divestiture or a merger, it may need to write down the value of its goodwill if the restructuring results in a significant change in the fair market value of the company's assets and liabilities.Reassessment: Companies are required to reassess the value of their goodwill on an annual basis to ensure that it is still accurate. If the value of the goodwill has changed, the company may need to write it down.Changes in accounting standards: Changes in accounting standards may also require companies to write down the value of their goodwill. For example, the adoption of new accounting standards may require companies to use different methods to value their goodwill, which could result in a write-down."}, {"label": 0, "content": "From what you've described, your spouse is a non-resident alien for US tax purposes.

There are generally a couple of different schools of analysis that may be worth passing along: Fundamental Analysis:Fundamental analysis of a business involves analyzing its financial statements and health, its management and competitive advantages, and its competitors and markets. When applied to futures and forex, it focuses on the overall state of the economy, interest rates, production, earnings, and management. When analyzing a stock, futures contract, or currency using fundamental analysis there are two basic approaches one can use; bottom up analysis and top down analysis. The term is used to distinguish such analysis from other types of investment analysis, such as quantitative analysis and technical analysis. Technical Analysis:In finance, technical analysis is a security analysis methodology for forecasting the direction of prices through the study of past market data, primarily price and volume. Behavioral economics and quantitative analysis use many of the same tools of technical analysis, which, being an aspect of active management, stands in contradiction to much of modern portfolio theory. The efficacy of both technical and fundamental analysis is disputed by the efficient-market hypothesis which states that stock market prices are essentially unpredictable. There are tools like \"Stock Screeners\" that will let you filter based on various criteria to use each analysis in a mix.  There are various strategies one could use.

Salary: The obvious one, what they pay you. Taxes: There are several taxes that an employer has to pay for the privilege of hiring someone, including social security taxes (which goes to your retirement), unemployment insurance tax (your unemployment benefits if they lay you off), and workers compensation tax (pays if you are injured on the job). (There may be other taxes that I'm not thinking of, but in any case those are the main ones.) Benefits: In the U.S. employers often pay for medical insurance, sometimes for dental, life, and disability. There's usually some sort of retirement plan. They expect to give you some number of vacation days, holidays, and sick days where they pay you even though you're not working. Companies sometimes offer other benefits, like discounts on buying company products, membership in health clubs, etc. Capital: Often the company has to provide you with some sort of equipment, like a computer; furniture, like a chair and desk; etc. As far as the company is concerned, all of the above are part of the cost of having you as an employee. If they would pay a domestic employee $60,000 in salary and $20,000 in taxes, then assuming the same benefits and capital investment, if a foreign employee would cost them $0 in taxes they should logically be willing to pay $80,000. Any big company will have accountants who figure out the total cost of a new employee in excruciating detail, and they will likely be totally rational about this. A smaller company might think, \"well, taxes don't really count ...\" This is irrational but people are not always rational. I don't know what benefits they are offering you, if any, and what equipment they will provide you with, if any.  I also don't know what taxes, if any, a U.S. company has to pay when hiring a remote employee in a foreign country. If anybody on here knows the answer to that, please chime in. Balanced against that, the company likely sees disadvantages to hiring a foreign remote employee, too. Communication will be more difficult, which may result in inefficiency. My previous employer used some contractors in India and while there were certainly advantages, the language and time zone issues caused difficulties. There are almost certainly some international bureaucratic inconveniences they will have to deal with. Etc. So while you should certainly calculate what it would cost them to have a domestic employee doing the same job, that's not necessarily the end of the story. And ultimately it all comes down to negotiations. Even if the company knows that by the time they add in taxes and benefits and whatever, a domestic employee will cost them $100,000 a year, if they are absolutely convinced that they should be able to hire an Austrian for $60,000 a year, that might be the best offer you will get.

P.E.ratio, book value, and PEG are helpful, and I tend to use them as a gauge for whether I think the stock is overpriced or not. I compare those values to others in the industry. SBUX right now has a PE of ~30, which looks about average for its peers (PEP, KKD, GMCR). So far so good. Does it pay a dividend? This isn't necessarily good or bad, just useful to know. I like dividend-paying stocks, even if it means the stock price might not grow as aggressively.

If you find it impossible to open a Vanguard account from wherever you're living, find a local brokerage account that will allow you to invest in the US stock market.

After the first year, you would earn $50 in interest (5% of $1000 is $50). If the interest is compounded annually, the balance in your account at the end of the first year would be $1050 ($1000 principal + $50 interest).Now let's say you leave the money in the account for another year. In the second year, you would earn interest not only on the initial $1000 principal, but also on the $50 in interest that was accumulated in the first year. This means that in the second year, you would earn 5% of $1050, or $52.50 in interest. The balance in your account at the end of the second year would be $1102.50 ($1050 principal + $52.50 interest).As you can see, the amount of interest earned increases each year due to the compound interest effect.

Not all possible stock values are represented, the number of possibilities has to be kept reasonable.

It's actually the third Friday in the month, June 15th in this case.  Thus these are bets on how the stock will move in the next 10 days. While the numbers are per share you can only trade options in lots of 100. The left side of the chart shows calls.  Suppose you sell a call at 19 (the top of the chart)  The last such trade would have gotten you a premium of 9.70 per share (the flip side of this is when the third friday rolls around it will most likely be exercised and they'll be paying you only 19 a share for a stock now trading at something over 26.)  Note the volume, bid and ask columns though--you're not going to get 9.70 for such a call as there is no buyer.  The most anybody is offering at present is 7.80 a share. Now, lets look farther down in the chart--say, a strike price of 30.  The last trade was only .10--people think it's very unlikely that FB will rise above 30 to make this option worthwhile and thus you get very little for being willing to sell at that price.  If FB stays at 26 the option will expire worthless and go away.  If it's up to 31 when the 15th rolls around they'll exercise the option, take your shares and pay you 30 for them.  Note that you already gave permission for the trade by selling the call, you can't back out later if it becomes a bad deal. Going over to the other side of the chart with the puts: Here the transaction goes the other way, come the 15th they have the option of selling you the shares for the strike price.  Lets look at the same values we did before.  19?  There's no trading, you can't do it. 30?  Here you will collect 3.20 for selling the put.  Come the 15th they have the right to sell you the stock for 30 a share.  If it's still 26 they're certainly going to do so, but if it's up to 31 it's worthless and you pocket the 3.20 Note that you will normally not be allowed to sell a call if you don't own the shares in question.  This is a safety measure as the risk in selling a call without the stock is infinite.  If the stock somehow zoomed up to 10,000 when the 15th rolls around you would have to come up with the shares and the only way you could get them is buy them on the open market--you would have to come up with a million dollars.

Furthermore, with the passage of the Affordable Care Act, such policies may become less common or disappear entirely. These policies aren't a great deal because of the effects of adverse selection and asymmetric information, two closely related concepts in the economics of insurance. When you purchase an insurance policy, the insurance company charges you a premium based on your average risk level or the average risk level of your risk pool, e.g. you and your fellow employees, if you get insurance through your employer. For health insurance, this average risk level is the average probability that you'll incur healthcare costs. The insurer's actuaries calculate this probability from numerous factors, like your age, sex, current health, socioeconomic status, etc. Asymmetric information exists when you know more about this probability than the insurance company does. For example, you may look like a relatively low-risk individual on paper, but little does the insurance company know, BASE jumping is one of your hobbies. Because you know about your hobby and the insurance company doesn't, you secretly know that your risk of incurring healthcare expenses is much higher than the insurance company expects. If the insurance company knew this, they would like to charge you a much higher premium, if they could. However, they can't, because a) they don't know about your hobby, and b) the premium may be decided for the entire group/risk pool, so they can't increase it simply because a few individuals in the group have higher risk levels. Adverse selection occurs when individuals with higher risk levels are more likely to buy insurance. You may decide that because of your dangerous hobby, you do want to take advantage of your employer's healthcare plan. Unfortunately for the insurance company, they can't adjust their price accordingly. Adverse selection is a major factor in insurance markets, so I didn't go into much detail here (too much detail is probably off-topic anyway). I can point you towards more resources on the topic if you're interested.  However, the situation is different when you purchase a dread disease policy.  By expressing interest in such a specific policy, e.g. a cancer insurance policy, you signal to the insurance company that you feel you have a higher risk of facing that disease. In your case, you're signaling to the insurance company that your family probably has a history of cancer or that you have habits that make you more susceptible to it, and your premiums will be higher to compensate the insurance company for bearing this additional risk. Since the insurance company already has a rough estimate of your chances of developing that illness, they may already know that you have a higher chance of facing it. However, when you express interest in a disease-specific policy, this signals the existence of asymmetric information (your family history or other habits), and the insurer assumes you know something they don't that elevates your risk level of that specific disease. Since these policies are optional policies often sold as riders to existing policies, the insurance company has more flexibility in pricing them. They can charge you a higher premium because you've signaled to the insurer that you have a significantly above-average risk of contracting a specific disease*. Also, the insurer can do a much better job of estimating the expected costs of insuring you since they need only focus on data surrounding one disease. The policy will be priced accordingly, i.e. in such a way that isn't necessarily beneficial to you. Furthermore, most dread disease policies aren't guaranteed renewable, which means that even if you are willing to keep paying the premiums, the insurance company doesn't have to keep insuring you. As your risk of developing the specific disease grows, e.g. with age, it may pass the point where insuring you is no longer an acceptable risk. The company expects you to develop the illness with the next few renewal cycles, so they decide not to renew your policy. The end result? The insurance company has the premiums you've paid previously, but you no longer have coverage for that illness, and ex post, you've suffered a net loss with no reduction of risk for the foreseeable future.  Dread disease policies are changing under the Affordable Care Act. According to healthcare.gov Starting in 2014, ... all new health insurance plans sold to individuals and small businesses, and plans purchased in the new Affordable Insurance Exchanges, must include a range of essential health benefits. The essential health benefits include quite a few areas of coverage; since this applies to policies offered on the state insurance exchanges and those offered outside of it, dread disease policies wouldn't seem to qualify. For more information, you can read the linked page on healthcare.gov or see Section 1302, subsection b), titled \"Essential Health Benefits Requirements\" in the law itself (p87). I imagine more details will be available on a state-by-state basis through 2014 and into 2015.  One legal source (see the discussion on p24) states that: whatever else the ACA does with excepted benefit policies, including specific disease and fixed dollar indemnity policies, it does explicitly provide that such policies do not count as minimum essential coverage for purposes of the ACA This seems pretty straightforward; a dread disease (or \"specific disease\" policy, as it's referred to in the article), won't count towards the minimum essential requirements. This may not be an issue for you, but for others, it's important to understand that you'll still need to pay the penalty if you only purchase one of these policies. The ACA spells this out in Section 5000(f) (see p316, which states that \"excepted benefit policies\" are excluded and defines them using the definition in the Public Health Service Act (PHSA). **The PSHA specifically includes \"Coverage only for a specified disease or illness\" in their definition of \"excepted benefit policies\" (see section 2791(b), paragraph 3A on p82, so it's probably a safe bet that such policies won't count towards the minimum. Also, as Rick pointed out in the comments, the Affordable Care Act also forbids lifetime limits on most insurance plans, so assuming you find an insurance policy with adequate coverage for the specific disease you're worried about, such a plan should cover the related expenses without a lifetime limit. Deductibles, annual limits, and other factors may complicate this somewhat.  In the section about lifetime limits (Sec. 2711, p2), the Affordable Care Act states that: A group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage may not establish ... lifetime limits on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or beneficiary.  However, the law states in the next paragraph that the preceding statement should not be construed to prevent a group health plan or health insurance coverage from placing annual or lifetime per beneficiary limits on specific covered benefits that are not essential health benefits under section 1302(b) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, to the extent that such limits are otherwise permitted under Federal or State law The section also contains similarly vague caveats about annual limits, so the actual details and limits may vary once individual states finalize their policies. The law is intentionally vague because the vast majority of the law's implementation is left up to individual states. Furthermore, certain parts of the law specify actions involving the Secretary of Health and Human Services, so these may require further codification in the future too. You should still read the fine print of any insurance policy you buy and evaluate it as you would any contract (see the next section).  Since a dread disease policy probably isn't a good idea, you'll probably want to evaluate the healthcare plans offered by your employer or individual plans offered in your area (if your employer doesn't offer coverage). I've tried to include the basic points offered in these articles to give you or future visitors some idea of where to start. These points may change once the Affordable Care Act is implemented, so I'll try to keep them as general as possible.  Services - Above and beyond the minimum essential requirements, what services does the plan offer? Are these services a good match for you and/or your family, or do they add unnecessary cost to the premium with little or no benefit? For example, my health insurance plan offers basic dental coverage with a small co-pay, so I don't need a separate dental plan, even though my employer offers one.  Choice - What doctors, clinics, hospitals, etc. are preferred providers under your plan? Do you need a referral from your primary care doctor to see a specialist, or can you find one on your own? Are the preferred providers convenient for you? In my first year of college (about five years ago), my student health insurance only covered a few hospitals that were in the suburbs and somewhat difficult for me to reach. This is something to keep in mind, depending on where you live.  Costs - This is a major one, obviously. Deductibles, copays, maximum cost limits over a year or your lifetime, out-of-network costs, etc. are all variables to consider.  There are other factors, but since I don't have a family, other members of the site can provide more detailed information about what to look for in family policies.  In place of a dread disease policy, you're likely better off purchasing a comprehensive health insurance policy, perhaps a catastrophic coverage policy with a high deductible that will kick in once you've exhausted your standard insurance policy. However, this may be a moot point since the passage of the Affordable Care Act may significantly reduce the availability of such policies anyway."}, {"label": 1, "content": "Evaluating a health insurance policy that covers a specific disease can be a complex process, as it involves considering a range of factors including the policy's coverage limits, exclusions, and deductibles. Here are some steps you can take to evaluate a health insurance policy that covers a specific disease:Understand the policy's coverage limits: Make sure you understand the policy's coverage limits for the specific disease you are interested in. This includes any limits on the number of visits or treatments covered, as well as any limits on the amount of money the policy will pay out for the specific disease.Look for exclusions: Check the policy's exclusions to see if there are any conditions or treatments that are not covered. This can be especially important if you have a preexisting condition or are considering a specific treatment that may not be covered.Consider the policy's deductibles: Consider the policy's deductibles, which are the amount of money you have to pay out of pocket before the insurance company starts covering your medical expenses. Make sure you understand the policy's deductibles and whether they are feasible for you to pay.Compare the policy to others: Compare the policy you are considering to other policies available to you. This can help you get a sense of the policy's value and whether it is a good fit for your needs.Consider seeking professional advice: If you are having difficulty understanding the policy or evaluating its coverage, consider seeking the advice of a health insurance broker or agent who can help you understand the policy and its terms."}, {"label": 0, "content": "Be very careful to hold on tight to your money!

However, if the price of the stock rises instead, the investor will have to buy it back at a higher price, resulting in a loss.Here's an example of how short selling works:Suppose an investor thinks that the price of XYZ stock, which is currently trading at $100 per share, is likely to fall in the near future. The investor borrows 100 shares of XYZ stock from a broker and sells them in the market for $10,000. A few days later, the price of XYZ stock falls to $90 per share. The investor buys 100 shares of XYZ stock for $9,000 and returns them to the broker. The investor has made a profit of $1,000, which is the difference between the sale price of $10,000 and the purchase price of $9,000.It's important to note that short selling carries a high level of risk, because the potential loss is unlimited.

I see no harm in moving the price down over time repeatedly.  In fact, I thin that is a good tactic to getting the most for the house.  If you happen to have the luxury of time, then keep lowering that price until it sells.  Don't fret how that behavior appears. You can lower the price as often as you like until it sells.  I am not a real estate agent, and I am a terrible negotiator, but I would lower the price every quarter until it sells.

You can do it yourself, or if you are not interested in that (large) amount of work, then hire a rental management company to do it for a fee. Renting a home is hard work and requires attention to detail, a good amount of your time and much labor.  If you just need to wait a couple of years before selling, renting it can be a good option to cover your costs while you wait for the market to reach you. You should get advice on how to handle the money, how to rent it, how to deal with renters, and the the laws are in your jurisdiction. Rent it out to a trusted friend or family member for a steal of a deal.  They save money, and you get the luxury of time waiting for the sale. With a real estate lawyer you hire, get a contract for a lease option or owner finance deal on the house.  Sometimes you can expand the market of people looking to buy your house.

There are tax benefits, but I would make any kind of a deal where tax deductions are the only benefit. This is common enough these days.  If you are unable to pay for the mortgage, it benefits you and the bank to get into a short sale arrangement.  They bank gets probably more money than if they have to foreclose (and they save money on legal fees) and you can get rid of the obligation. You will do a deed in lieu or the short sale depending on how the market it and what the house can be sold for.  You and the bank will have to work it out. This will ruin for a credit for a while, and you will not likely qualify to get a new mortgage for at least a few years. You can stop paying your mortgage, tell the bank and they will foreclose.  This is going to ruin your credit for a long time as well as disqualify you from mortgages in the near future.  Don't do this.

For a fairly standard case of an non-resident alien international student living full time in the US - your capital gains are US sourced. Let me quote the following text a couple of paragraphs down the line you quoted on the same page: Gain or loss from the sale or exchange of personal property generally   has its source in the United States if the alien has a tax home in the   United States. The key factor in determining if an individual is a   U.S. resident for purposes of the sourcing of capital gains is whether   the alien's \"tax home\" has shifted to the United States. If an alien   does not have a tax home in the United States, then the alien\u2019s U.S.   source capital gains would be treated as foreign-source and thus   nontaxable.

What it means is that if you move to the US for a significant period of time (expected length of 1 year or more), your tax home is assumed to have shifted to the US and the capital gains are sourced to the US from the start of your move. For example: you are a foreign diplomat, and your 4-year assignment started in May. Year-end - you're not US tax resident (diplomats exempt), but you've stayed in the US for more than 183 days, and since your assignment is longer than 1 year - your tax home is now in the US. You'll pay the 30% flat tax. Another example: You're a foreign airline pilot, coming to the US every other day flying the airline aircraft. You end up staying in the US 184 days, but your tax home hasn't shifted, nor you're a US tax resident - you don't pay the flat tax.

Consider a 12-unit apartment building full of rent paying tenants.  A tenant gives notice and leaves.  So do 4 more.  With only 7/12 tenants, the building stops being a revenue center and becomes a massive money pit.  Is that acceptable?  Heck no!  Realistically this will be managed by a property management company, and of course they'll seek new tenants, not stopping merely because the owner died.  This situation is not different; the same fiscal logic applies.  The counter-argument is usually along the lines of \"stuff might happen if you rent it out\"... true.

Renting brings a chunk of cash that comes in from tenants - $12,000/year on a $1000/mo. rental. And that will barely pay the bills if you have a young mortgage on a freshly purchased house at recent market rates.  But on an old mortgage, renting is like printing money.  That money propagates first to the estate (presumably it is holding back a \"fix the roof\" emergency fund), and then to the beneficiaries.  It means getting annual checks from the estate, instead of constantly being dunned for another repair.  But I don't care about making revenue (outside of putting back a kitty to replace the roof).  Even if it was net zero, it means the maintenance is being done.  This being the point.  It is keeping the house in good repair, occupied, insured, and professionally managed -- fit and ready for the bequest's purpose: occupancy of an aunt.  What's the alternative?  Move an aunt into a house that's been 10 years abandoned?

Only the clearing banks and similar (e.g. bacs) have access to rtgs. You can send a chaps payment fairly quickly, but that costs. Chaps immediately triggers an rtgs transfer once the sending bank agrees and so you can be certain that the money is being paid.  Hence its use for large amounts. Bacs also sits on the rtgs but to keep costs down it batches tranfers up. Because we are talking about bank reserve movements, checks have to be in place and that can take time. Furthermore the potential for fraud is higher than chaps since these are aggregrated transactions a layer removed, so a delay reduces the chance of payment failing after apparently being sent. Faster payments is a new product by bacs that speeds up the bacs process by doing a number of transfers per day. Hence the two hour clearing. For safety it can only be used for up to 10k. Second tier banks will hold accounts with clearing banks so they are another step down. Foreign currency transfers require the foreign Central Bank reserve somewhere, and so must be mediated by at least one clearing bank in that country. Different countries are at different stages in their technology.  Uk clearing is 2h standard now but US is a little behind I believe.  Much of Europe is speeding up. Rather like bitcoin clearing, you have a choice between speed and safety.

Conversely, if you consistently miss payments or pay late, this could negatively affect your credit rating.Credit utilization: Your credit utilization is the percentage of your available credit that you are using. If you have a large balance on your cell phone contract, this could increase your credit utilization and potentially lower your credit rating.Credit inquiries: When you apply for a new cell phone contract, the provider may perform a credit check, which could result in a \"hard\" inquiry on your credit report. Having too many hard inquiries in a short period of time can lower your credit rating.In general, it's important to manage your credit responsibly by paying your bills on time, keeping your balances low, and limiting the number of credit inquiries you have.

A car loan is a liability, not an asset like your $100k in cash.  Besides, you don't get a dollar-for-dollar consideration when figuring a car's value against the loan it is encumbered by.  In other words, the car is only worth what someone's willing to pay for it, not what your loan amount on it is. Remember that taking on a loan will increase your debt-to-income ratio, which is always a factor when trying to obtain a mortgage.  At the same time, taking on new debt just prior to shopping for a mortgage could make it more difficult to find a lender.  Every time a credit report (hard inquiry) is run on you, it temporarily impacts your credit score.  The only exception to this rule is when it comes to mortgages.  In the U.S., the way it works is that once you start shopping for a mortgage with lenders, for the next 30 days, additional inquiries into your credit report for purposes of mortgage funding do not count against your credit score, so it's a \"freebie\" in a way.  You can't use this to shop for any other kind of credit, but the purpose is to allow you a chance to shop for the best mortgage rate you can get without adversely impacting your credit. In the end, my advice is to stop looking at how much house you can buy, and instead focus on a house with payments you can live with and afford.  Trying to buy the most house based on what someone's willing to lend you leaves no room in the near-term for being able to borrow if the property has some repair needs, you want to furnish/upgrade it, or for any other unanticipated need which may arise that requires credit.

For example, the value of a house may not increase at the same rate as the general price level if there are changes in the demand for housing or if the house is in a location that becomes less desirable. Additionally, the value of a house may be affected by factors such as the condition of the house, the quality of the neighborhood, and the availability of financing.It is important to keep in mind that investing in housing carries its own set of risks, including the possibility of a decline in the value of the property.

When you sell a naked put, you are taking on the risk that the stock will increase in value, which could also result in a loss if you are required to buy the stock at a higher price than the current market price.Potential return: When you buy a stock, your potential return is the difference between the purchase price and the sale price of the stock. When you sell a naked put, your potential return is the premium that you receive for selling the put option, minus the cost of buying the stock if the option is exercised.Requirements: Buying a stock requires you to have the cash to pay for the stock upfront. Selling a naked put requires you to have margin available in your account, as you may be required to buy the stock at any time before the expiration date of the option.Both buying a stock and selling a naked put can be risky and are not suitable for all investors.

The answer is that there are no usual terms. There are a handful of different options coming out now for this exact scheme. Examples include the UK Governments \"Help To Buy\" scheme. Accomodation is offered at a normal rate, and a small portion of the rent is set aside each month. At the end of a fixed period, that money becomes a deposit which the letter hands over to a mortgage provider who accepts it as a deposit. This might well be a terminology thing, since the other scenario which people described falls into the same name you've used. That scenario is where the investor who owns the property is considering sale of the property, and is happy to negotiate a price up front for the next year. Usually the rent and price is higher than the market rate because if the market goes well over the next year they could end up out of pocket. Putting that into perspective, over that year they are gaining their $1,000 a month or so, but having $100,000 invested means a return of 12%. If the property value is over $250,000 which I believe to be more likely, they are achieving a return of (I think) 4.8%. That's not a bad rate, by any means, but realistically they are losing a bit more for maintenance, and they could be making more from their money. If the market were to go up in that time by more than 4.8% (my house, for instance, increased in value by over 15% in the last 12 months), they are making a substantial loss since you are getting a house at 15% below the market rate. The total works out to a 10.2% loss for them. Note that I don't know the US housing market at all, I'm speaking mostly from my experience of the market here in the UK.

When valuing an ESPP, don't think about what you might sell the shares for in the future, think about what the market would charge you for that option today. In general, an option is worth much less than the underlying share itself. For the simplest example, assume you work at a public company, and your exercise price for your options is $.30, and you can only exercise those options until the end of today, and the cost of the shares on the public stock exchange is also $.30. You have the same 'strike price' as everyone else in the market, making your option worth nothing. In truth, holding that right to a specific strike price into the future does give you value, because it means you can realize the upside in share price gains, without risking any money on share losses. So, how do you value the options? If it's a public company with an active options market, you can easily compare your $.30 strike price with the value of call options in the market that have a $.30 strike price. That becomes the value to you of the option (caveat: it is unlikely you can find an exact match for the terms of your vesting period, but you should be able to find a good starting point). If it's a public company without an active options market, you will have to do a bit of estimation. If a current share is worth $.25 (so, close to your strike price), then your option is worth a little bit, but not much. Compare other shares in your industry / company size to get examples of the relative value between an option and a share. If the current share price is worth $.35, then your option is worth about $.05 [the $.05 profit you could get by immediately exercising and selling, plus a bit more for an option on a share that you can't buy in the open market]. If it's a private company, then you need to be very clear on how shares are to be valued, and what methods you have available to sell back to the company / other individuals. You can then consider as per above, how to value the option for a share, vs the share itself. Without a clear way to sell your shares of a private company [ideally through a sale directly back to the company that you are able to force them to agree on; ie: the company will buyback shares at 5x Net income for the previous year, or something like that], then the value of a small number of shares is very nebulous. There is an extremely limited market for shares of private companies, if you don't own enough to exert control. In your case, because the valuation appears to be $2/share [be sure that these are the same share classes you have the option to buy], your option would be worth a little more than $1.70, if you didn't have to wait 4 years to exercise it. This would be total compensation of about $10k, if you were able to exercise today. Many people don't end up working for an early job in their career for 4 years, so you need to consider whether how much that will reduce the value of the ESPP for you personally. Compared with salary of 90k, 10k worth of stock in 4 years may not be a heavy motivating compensation consideration. Note also that because the company is not public, the valuation of $2/share should be taken with a grain of salt."}, {"label": 1, "content": "If you want to evaluate the worth of an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) at a startup, there are a few things you can consider:The discount: Many ESPPs offer a discount on the purchase price of the stock.

If you open multiple credit cards at once, you will have a larger credit limit, which could result in a higher credit utilization ratio. This could have a negative impact on your credit score.Managing multiple accounts: It can be challenging to manage multiple credit card accounts, especially if you are new to credit. Each card will have its own due date, annual fee, and interest rate, and it can be easy to lose track of these details if you have multiple cards.In general, it is best to start with one or two credit cards and build a solid credit history before considering adding more. This will allow you to establish a good credit score and establish a track record of responsible credit use."}, {"label": 0, "content": "I see no reason why a US ID would be mandatory anywhere in the UK.

One reason is that the interest rates on home loans are generally lower than the interest rates on gold loans. This is because home loans are secured loans, meaning that the lender can seize the borrower's home if they default on the loan. The lender has a greater level of protection with a secured loan, so they are able to offer a lower interest rate.Another reason why a home loan may be cheaper than a gold loan is that the repayment period for a home loan is typically longer than the repayment period for a gold loan. This means that the borrower has more time to pay back the loan, which can make it easier to manage the monthly payments.Finally, the amount of the loan may be a factor in the difference in cost between a home loan and a gold loan. Home loans can be for much larger amounts than gold loans, and the interest rates on large loans tend to be lower than the interest rates on small loans.It's important to note that these are general trends and the specific terms and conditions of a home loan or gold loan will depend on the lender and the borrower's creditworthiness.

For instance, a large public company that contracts with a smaller supplier or service company, also public, might make a tender offer below market price. The market will look at this price and the business relationship, and wonder what the larger company knows about the smaller one that they don't. Now, what happens when investors lose confidence in a stock? They sell it, supply goes up, demand goes down, and the price drops. The company making the tender offer can then get its shares either way; directly via the offer, or on the open market. This is, however, usually not successful beyond the very short term, and typically only works because the company making a tender offer is the 800-pound gorilla, which can dictate its own terms with practically anyone else it meets. Such offers are also very closely watched by the SEC; if there's any hint that the larger company is acting in a predatory manner, or that its management is using the power and information of the company to profit themselves, the strategy will backfire as the larger company finds itself the target of SEC and DoJ legal proceedings."}, {"label": 1, "content": "A tender offer is a proposal made by a company or individual to purchase a certain number of shares of a publicly traded company at a specific price.

One reason could be that the company is attempting to acquire a large number of shares at a lower cost, which could be beneficial for the company's financial performance.

Unless you're extremely tight and you're trying to squeeze by day by day, asking \"do I have enough cash to buy food for today?\" and so on, you're doing too much work. Here's what I do. I make a list of all my bills. Some are a fixed amount every month, like the mortgage and insurance premiums. Others are variable, like electric and heating bills, but still pretty predictable.  Most bills are monthly, but I have a few that come less frequently, like water bills in my area come every 3 months and I have to pay property taxes twice a year. For these you have to calculate how much they cost each month. Like for the water bill, it's once every 3 months so I divide a typical bill by 3. Always round up or estimate a little high to be safe. Groceries are a little tricky because I don't buy groceries on any regular schedule, and sometimes I buy a whole bunch at once and other times just a few things. When groceries were a bigger share of my income, I kept track of what I spent for a couple of months to figure out an average per month. (Today I'm a little richer and I just think of groceries as coming from my spending money.) I allocate a percentage of my income for contributions to church and charities and count this just like bills. It's a good idea to put aside something for savings and/or paying down any outstanding loans every month. Then I add these up to say okay, here's how much I need each month to pay the bills. Subtract that from my monthly income and that's what I have for spending money. I get paid twice a month so I generally pay bills when I get paid. For most bills the due date is far enough ahead that I can wait the maximum half a month to pay it. (Worst case the bill comes the day after I pay the bills from this paycheck.)  Then I keep enough money in my checking account to, (a) Cover any bills until the next paycheck and allow for the particularly large bills; and (b) provide some cushion in case I make a mistake -- forget to record a check or make an arithmetic error or whatever; and (c) provide some cushion for short-term unexpected expenses. To be safe, (a) should be the total of your bills for a month, or as close to that as you can manage. (b) should be a couple of hundred dollars if you can manage it, more if you make a lot of mistakes. If you've calculated your expenses properly and only spend the difference, keeping enough money in the bank should fall out naturally. I think it's a lot easier to try to manage your money on a monthly basis than on a daily basis. Most of us don't spend money every day, and we spend wildly different amounts from day to day. Most days I probably spend zero, but then one day I'll buy a new TV or computer and spend hundreds.  Update in response to question What I do in real life is this: To calculate my available cash to spend, I simply take the balance in my checking account -- assuming that all checks and electronic payments have cleared. My mortgage is deducted from my checking every month so I post that to my checking a month in advance. I pay a lot of things with automatic charges to a credit card these days, so my credit card bills are large and can't be ignored. So subtract my credit card balances. Subtract my reserve amount. What's left is how much I can afford to spend. So for example: Say I look at the balance in my checkbook today and it's, say, $3000. That's the balance after any checks and other transactions have cleared, and after subtracting my next mortgage payment. Then I subtract what I owe on credit cards. Let's say that was $1,200. So that leaves $1,800. I try to keep a reserve of $1,500. That's plenty to pay my routine monthly bills and leave a healthy reserve. So subtract another $1,500 leaves $300. That's how much I can spend. I could keep track of this with a spreadsheet or a database but what would that gain? The amount in my checking account is actual money. Any spreadsheet could accumulate errors and get farther and farther from accurate values. I use a spreadsheet to figure out how much spending money I should have each month, but that's just to use as a guideline. If it came to, say, $100, I wouldn't make grandiose plans about buying a new Mercedes. If it came to $5,000 a month than buying a fancy new car might be realistic. It also tells me how much I can spend without having to carefully check balances and add it up. These days I have a fair amount of spending money so when, for example, I recently decided I wanted to buy some software that cost $100 I just bought it with barely a second thought. When my spending money was more like $100 a month, lunch at a fast food place was a big event that I planned weeks in advance. (Obviously, I hope, don't get stupid about \"small amounts\". If you can easily afford $100 for an impulse purchase, that doesn't mean that you can afford $100 five times a day every day.) Two caveats: 1. It helps to have a limited number of credit cards so you can keep the balances under control. I have two credit cards I use for almost everything, so I only have two balances to keep track of. I used to have more and it got confusing, it was easy to lose track of how much I really owed, which is a set up for getting in trouble."}, {"label": 1, "content": "To calculate the money needed for bills on a daily basis, you will need to first determine your total monthly expenses for bills.

For example, if your total monthly expenses are $2,000 and there are 30 days in the month, you will need to set aside approximately $66.67 per day to cover your bills.It can be helpful to create a budget to track your expenses and ensure that you are setting aside enough money each day to cover your bills.

I know of some sites who are legit, and pay people (not money, but gift cards, airline miles, etc) for participating in surveys. My own HMO (Kaiser in California) in fact pays (small amounts) to members who participate in enough surveys, so its legit. Are these sites worthwhile to consider for extra income? Not something you could live off, but definitely can get you enough gift cards for your weekly trip to Starbucks. What do I need to consider tax wise? Usually the amounts are very low, and are not paid in cash. While it is income, I doubt the IRS will chase you if you don't report the $20 Amazon gift card you got from there. It should, strictly speaking, be reported (probably as hobby income) on your tax return. Most people don't bother dealing with such small amounts though. In some cases (like the HMO I mentioned), its basically a rebate of the money paid (you pay your copays, deductibles etc. Since the surveys are only for members, you basically get your money back, not additional income). This is in fact similar to credit card rebates. Is there a best practice for handling the income?

Additionally, index funds may have lower turnover than actively managed funds, which can also reduce the potential for realizing capital gains.It is worth noting that index funds can still generate capital gains, as they may need to sell securities to rebalance their portfolio or to meet redemptions by investors. However, these capital gains are typically distributed to fund shareholders, rather than being realized by the fund itself. If you hold your index fund in a taxable account, you will be responsible for paying taxes on these capital gains when they are distributed to you.In summary, index investing can be a tax-efficient way to invest, but it is important to be aware of the potential for capital gains and to consider the tax implications of your investment strategy."}, {"label": 0, "content": "You can buy stocks in the IRA, similarly to your regular investment account.

Thus the pitfall is that it is heavily weighted towards (and often tracks) the performance of a few stocks including: Apple, Google (Alphabet), Microsoft, Amazon, Intel and Amgen.

The reason it is potentially not a great idea has less to do with the fact that gold has factors other than just risk on/off and inflation that affect its price (even though it does!); but more to do with the fact that it is harder to own gold and move in and out of positions efficiently than it is a bond index fund.   For example, consider buying physical gold.  To do so you have to spend some time evaluating the purchase, you are usually paying a slight premium above the spot price to purchase it, and you should usually also have some form of security or insurance for it.  So, it has additional costs.  Possibly worth it as part of a long-term investment strategy; if you believe gold will appreciate over a decade. But not so much if you are holding it for as little as a few weeks and constantly moving in and out of the position over the year. The same is true to some extent of investing in gold in the form of an ETF.  At least a portion of \"their gold\" comes from paper or futures contracts which must be rolled every month.  This creates a slight inefficiency.  While possibly not a deal breaker, it would not be as attractive to someone trading on momentum versus fundamentals in my opinion.

Under a 30% 'simple' rate, what tools would the government use to encourage trade in specific areas? Will state income tax deduction also be removed? This is going to punish those in a state with a high income tax more than those in states without income tax. Those are all just 'common' deductions that affect a lot of people, you could easily say 'no' to all of them and just piss off a bunch of people, but what about selling stock though? I paid $100 for the stock and I sold it for $120, do I need to pay $36 tax on that because it is a 'simple' 30% tax rate or are we allowing the cost of goods sold deduction (it's called something else I believe when talking about stocks but it's the same idea?) What about if I travel for work to tutor individuals, can I deduct my mileage expenses? Do I need to pay 30% income tax on my earnings and principal from a Roth IRA? A lot of people have contributed to a Roth with the understanding that withdrawals will be tax free, changing those rules are punishing people for using vehicles intentionally created by the government. Are we going to go around and dismantle all non-profits that subsist entirely on tax-deductible donations? Do I need to pay taxes on the employer's cost of my health insurance?

Could you provide more context or clarify your question?"}, {"label": 0, "content": "Unemployment insurance provides a temporary safety net to workers who lose their jobs by replacing a portion of their salary for certain periods. Each state administers its own unemployment insurance program so some rules may vary from state to state. To receive unemployment insurance payments, you must have lost your job through no fault of your own. If you quit your job or lost it because of poor performance or another justifiable reason, you are not eligible for unemployment insurance benefits. State unemployment insurance programs require claimants to have worked sufficiently before they can claim benefits. As soon as you apply for unemployment insurance, an agency with the state in which you live will verify that you were a victim of a layoff by contacting your previous employer and making sure you lost your job due to lack of work and not an action within your control. After the state verifies you were indeed the victim of a layoff, your weekly payment is calculated. Your payment will be a percentage of what you made in your previous job, generally between 20 percent and 50 percent, depending on your state. Unemployment insurance replaces only a portion of your previous pay because it is intended to pay only for the essentials of living such as food and utilities until you find new employment. Before you begin receiving benefits, you must complete a waiting period of typically one or two weeks. If you find a new job during this period, you will not be eligible for unemployment benefits, even if the job does not pay you as much as your previous job. After the waiting period, you will begin to receive your weekly payments. Employers pay for unemployment insurance through payroll taxes. So, while employees' work and earnings history are important to funding their unemployment benefits, the money does not come from their pay. Employer unemployment insurance contributions depend on several factors, including how many former employees have received benefits. Employers pay taxes on an employee's base wages, which vary by state. California, for example taxes employers on the first $7,000 of an employee's annual earnings, while neighboring Oregon taxes up to $32,000 of wages. Employers must set aside funds each payroll period and then report taxes and pay their states quarterly. States have several categories of tax rates they charge employers. New businesses and those first adding employees pay the \"new rate,\" which is typically lower and geared toward small businesses. Established businesses who haven't paid their taxes recently or properly are usually assessed the \"standard rate\" --- the highest possible tax rate, which in 2010 ranged from 5.4 percent in several states including Georgia, Hawaii and Alaska to 13.56 percent in Pennsylvania. Businesses in good standing may receive discounts under the \"experienced rate.\" Depending on the number of employees a business has and how many former employees have claimed unemployment, states can give sizable rate reductions. The fewer claims, the lower the rate a business pays in unemployment insurance taxes. As a result of the economic crisis legislation has been passed to extend Unemployment benefits.  Regular unemployment benefits are paid for a maximum of 26 weeks in most states. However, additional weeks of extended unemployment benefits are available during times of high unemployment. The unemployment extension legislation passed by Congress in February 2012 changed the way the tiers of Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) are structured. A tier of unemployment is an extension of a certain amount of weeks of unemployment benefits. There are currently four tiers of unemployment benefits. Each tier provides extra weeks of unemployment in addition to basic state unemployment benefits.

It is designed to provide a temporary source of income for workers while they are looking for new employment.To be eligible for unemployment insurance, a worker must have been employed for a certain period of time and must have lost their job through no fault of their own, such as being laid off or having their hours reduced. The worker must also meet certain requirements, such as being actively seeking work and being available to work.To receive unemployment insurance, a worker must file a claim with their state's unemployment insurance agency. The agency will review the claim to determine if the worker is eligible for benefits. If the claim is approved, the agency will provide the worker with a weekly benefit amount based on their previous income.The amount of the benefit and the length of time it is provided will depend on the worker's state of residence and the specific unemployment insurance program. In most cases, unemployment insurance benefits are provided for a limited time, usually 26 weeks, although some states may provide benefits for longer periods in cases of high unemployment.Unemployment insurance is funded through taxes paid by employers, and the funds are managed by the state government."}, {"label": 0, "content": "I actually just did that with my Chase Freedom card.

Disadvantage: When inflation is greater than zero, which it has been for many decades, your cash is continually losing value.

There are tax penalties for withdrawing the money before retirement. In general, you should only put money in an IRA if you expect to leave it there until you retire. Or at least, for a long time. Whole life is a combination of a life insurance policy and an investment. Advantages: Combines insurance and investment into one convenient monthly payment.

If you have no need for life insurance -- if you're not supporting anyone or you're confidant they could get along without you or you don't like them and don't care what happens to them when you're gone or whatever -- then there's no point buying life insurance, whole or term. You're paying for a product that you don't need. It's pretty common advice to tell people that instead of buying a whole life policy, they should buy a term policy with the same coverage, and then invest the difference in the premium. For example, if you were considering getting a $100,000 whole life policy that costs $50 per month (just making up numbers, of course it depends on your age, health, etc), and you see you could get a $100,000 term life policy for $30 per month, you will almost certainly do better in the long run to buy the $30 term policy and put the other $20 into investments. The catch to this plan is that there are usually transaction costs to investing. Even a discount broker like Ameritrade or Scott Trade charges around $10 per transaction. So if you tried to invest $20 each month, you'd lose half of it to transaction fees. Which means that in practice, you'd have to save that money up until you had at least a few hundred.

It says that sales on any day are matched firstly with purchases made on the same day for the purposes of ascertaining any gain/loss. Hence the phrase 'bed-and-breakfast' ('b&b') when you wish to crystalise a gain (that is within the exempt amount) and re-establish a purchase price at a higher level.  You do the sale on one day, just before the market closes, which gets matched with your original purchase, and then you buy the shares back the next day, just after the market opens.  This is standard tax-planning.  Whenever you have a paper gain, and you wish to lock that gain out of being taxed, you do a bed-and-breakfast transaction, the idea being to use up your annual exemption each and every year.  Of course, if your dealing costs are high, then they may outweigh any tax saved, and so it would be pointless. For the purpose of an example, let's assume that the UK tax year is the same as the calendar year. Scenario 1. Suppose I bought some shares in 2016, for a total price of Stg.50,000. Suppose by the end of 2016, the holding is worth Stg.54,000, resulting in a paper gain of Stg.4,000. Question.  Should I do a b&b transaction to make use of my Stg.11,100 annual exemption ? Answer.  Well, with transaction costs at 1.5% for a round-trip trade, suppose, and stamp duty on the purchase of 0.5%, your total costs for a b&b will be Stg1,080, and your tax saved (upon some future sale date) assuming you are a 20% tax-payer is 20%x(4,000-1,080) = Stg584 (the transaction costs are deductible, we assume).  This does not make sense. Scenario 2. The same as scenario 1., but the shares are worth Stg60,000 by end-2016. Answer.  The total transaction costs are 2%x60,000 = 1,200 and so the taxable gain of 10,000-1,200 = 8,800 would result in a tax bill of 20%x8,800 = 1,760 and so the transaction costs are lower than the tax to be saved (a strict analysis would take into account only the present value of the tax to be saved), it makes sense to crystalise the gain.  We sell some day before the tax year-end, and re-invest the very next day. Scenario 3. The same as scenario 1., but the shares are worth Stg70,000 by end-2016. Answer.  The gain of 20,000 less costs would result in a tax bill for 1,500 (this is: 20%x(20,000 - 2%x70,000 - 11,100) ).  This tax bill will be on top of the dealing costs of 1,400.  But the gain is in excess of the annual exemption.  The strategy is to sell just enough of the holding to crystallise a taxable gain of just 11,100. The fraction, f%, is given by: f%x(70,000-50,000) - 2%xf%x70,000 = 11,100 ... which simplifies to: f% = 11,100/18,600 = 59.68%. The tax saved is 20%x11,100 = 2,220, versus costs of 2%x59.58%x70,000 = 835.52. This strategy of partial b&b is adopted because it never makes sense to pay tax early !

Regardless, I do think it's odd that they would knock 2K off the price if you finance with them, but not if you pay cash. The only reason they would do that is if they intend to make at least 2K in interest over the life of the loan, but they have no way of guaranteeing you won't refi. Therefore, I suspect they are bluffing and would probably close the deal if you wrote them a check (or put the cash on the table) for 2K less.

On each subsequent day, X goes up or down by 1 with probability 1/2. Let's think of buying a call option on X. A European option with a strike price of S that expires on day N, if held until that day and then exercised if profitable, would yield a value Y = min(X[N]-S, 0). This has an expected value E[Y] that you could actually calculate. (should be related to the binomial distribution, but my probability & statistics hat isn't working too well today) The market value V[k] of that option on day #k, where 1 < k < N, should be V[k] = E[Y]|X[k], which you can also actually calculate. On day #N, V[N] = Y. (the value is known) An American option, if held until day #k and then exercised if profitable, would yield a value Y[k] = min(X[k]-S, 0).  For the moment, forget about selling the option on the market. (so, the choices are either exercise it on some day #k, or letting it expire) Let's say it's day k=N-1.  If X[N-1] >= S+1 (in the money), then you have two choices: exercise today, or exercise tomorrow if profitable. The expected value is the same. (Both are equal to X[N-1]-S). So you might as well exercise it and make use of your money elsewhere. If X[N-1] <= S-1 (out of the money), the expected value is 0, whether you exercise today, when you know it's worthless, or if you wait until tomorrow, when the best case is if X[N-1]=S-1 and X[N] goes up to S, so the option is still worthless. But if X[N-1] = S (at the money), here's where it gets interesting. If you exercise today, it's worth 0. If wait until tomorrow, there's a 1/2 chance it's worth 0 (X[N]=S-1), and a 1/2 chance it's worth 1 (X[N]=S+1). Aha! So the expected value is 1/2. Therefore you should wait until tomorrow. Now let's say it's day k=N-2.  Similar situation, but more choices: If X[N-2] >= S+2, you can either sell it today, in which case you know the value = X[N-2]-S, or you can wait until tomorrow, when the expected value is also X[N-2]-S. Again, you might as well exercise it now. If X[N-2] <= S-2, you know the option is worthless. If X[N-2] = S-1, it's worth 0 today, whereas if you wait until tomorrow, it's either worth an expected value of 1/2 if it goes up (X[N-1]=S), or 0 if it goes down, for a net expected value of 1/4, so you should wait. If X[N-2] = S, it's worth 0 today, whereas tomorrow it's either worth an expected value of 1 if it goes up, or 0 if it goes down -> net expected value of 1/2, so you should wait. If X[N-2] = S+1, it's worth 1 today, whereas tomorrow it's either worth an expected value of 2 if it goes up, or 1/2 if it goes down (X[N-1]=S) -> net expected value of 1.25, so you should wait. If it's day k=N-3, and X[N-3] >= S+3 then E[Y] = X[N-3]-S and you should exercise it now; or if X[N-3] <= S-3 then E[Y]=0.  But if X[N-3] = S+2 then there's an expected value E[Y] of (3+1.25)/2 = 2.125 if you wait until tomorrow, vs. exercising it now with a value of 2; if X[N-3] = S+1 then E[Y] = (2+0.5)/2 = 1.25, vs. exercise value of 1; if X[N-3] = S then E[Y] = (1+0.5)/2 = 0.75 vs. exercise value of 0; if X[N-3] = S-1 then E[Y] = (0.5 + 0)/2 = 0.25, vs. exercise value of 0; if X[N-3] = S-2 then E[Y] = (0.25 + 0)/2 = 0.125, vs. exercise value of 0. (In all 5 cases, wait until tomorrow.) You can keep this up; the recursion formula is E[Y]|X[k]=S+d = {(E[Y]|X[k+1]=S+d+1)/2 + (E[Y]|X[k+1]=S+d-1) for N-k > d > -(N-k), when you should wait and see} or {0 for d <= -(N-k), when it doesn't matter and the option is worthless} or {d for d >= N-k, when you should exercise the option now}. The market value of the option on day #k should be the same as the expected value to someone who can either exercise it or wait. It should be possible to show that the expected value of an American option on X is greater than the expected value of a European option on X. The intuitive reason is that if the option is in the money by a large enough amount that it is not possible to be out of the money, the option should be exercised early  (or sold), something a European option doesn't allow, whereas if it is nearly at the money, the option should be held, whereas if it is out of the money by a large enough amount that it is not possible to be in the money, the option is definitely worthless. As far as real securities go, they're not random walks (or at least, the probabilities are time-varying and more complex), but there should be analogous situations. And if there's ever a high probability a stock will go down, it's time to exercise/sell an in-the-money American option, whereas you can't do that with a European option. edit: ...what do you know: the computation I gave above for the random walk isn't too different conceptually from the Binomial options pricing model."}, {"label": 1, "content": "American-style options are worth more than European-style options because they give the holder the right to exercise the option at any time before expiration, while European-style options can only be exercised at expiration.

This allows the holder to potentially profit from the difference between the option price and the market price. In contrast, a holder of a European-style option would not be able to take advantage of the price increase until expiration, which may be too late.In general, the greater flexibility and potential value of American-style options make them more expensive than European-style options.

This can be a useful way for investors to gradually accumulate more shares of a particular stock, without having to make additional cash purchases.Here's how dividend reinvestment works:An investor owns shares of a company that declares a dividend.The investor has chosen to participate in the company's dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP).When the dividend is paid out, the investor's account will be credited with the value of the dividend in cash.Instead of receiving the cash, the investor's account will be used to purchase additional shares of the same stock at the current market price.The investor's account will be updated to reflect the additional shares purchased, and the investor will now own more shares of the stock.It's important to note that dividend reinvestment plans may come with fees and restrictions, so it's a good idea to carefully review the terms and conditions before signing up for a DRIP.

Stock grants can take various forms, such as stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), and employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs).If you receive a stock grant, you may be required to pay taxes on the value of the stock at the time you receive it or when you sell the stock. The specific tax treatment of your stock grant depends on the type of grant you receive and the rules that apply to it.Here is a brief overview of how different types of stock grants are taxed:Stock options: Stock options give you the right to buy a specific number of shares of your company's stock at a fixed price (also known as the strike price) at some point in the future. If you exercise your stock options, you will typically be required to pay taxes on the difference between the strike price and the fair market value of the stock at the time you exercise the options. This difference is known as the \"bargain element.\" The bargain element is generally considered to be taxable as ordinary income, and you will be required to pay taxes on it when you exercise your options.Restricted stock units (RSUs): RSUs are a type of stock grant that gives you the right to receive a specific number of shares of your company's stock at a future date. You may be required to pay taxes on the value of the RSUs when they vest (i.e., when you become entitled to receive the stock). The value of the RSUs at vesting is generally considered to be taxable as ordinary income.Employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs): ESPPs are a type of stock purchase plan that allows you to purchase your company's stock at a discounted price. If you participate in an ESPP, you may be required to pay taxes on the discount you receive when you buy the stock. The discount is generally considered to be taxable as ordinary income, and you will be required to pay taxes on it when you sell the stock.It's important to note that the tax treatment of stock grants can be complex, and it's a good idea to consult with a tax professional to understand your specific tax obligations.

If your credit limit matches your monthly income, and if you pay off your card each month, I think it is harder to overspend as you don't have more credit available than you can afford to spend. However this is countered by that, a slightly higher credit limit may help to avoid fees from exceeding your credit card limit.

Increasing your credit limit may lower your credit utilization ratio, but if you start using more of your available credit, it could also have the opposite effect.Temptation to overspend: It can be tempting to use a higher credit limit to make larger purchases or more frequent purchases, which may not be financially feasible or responsible.Fees or higher interest rates: Some credit card companies may charge a fee for increasing your credit limit or may raise your interest rate as a result of the increase.It's important to carefully consider the potential downsides before requesting an increase in your credit card spending limit.

Last year I had the option to buy a house, but I decided against it because in my area it is getting harder and harder every year to sell it at a reasonable price. But if I had bought a house, my mother would have lent me the money, with me paying it back to her over the years on 3% interest. So it would have been some kind of a private loan. But my mom would never have taken ownership of the house, since it was not her intention to own it in any way. (Does your dad intend to own the house and rent it to you? If yes, and if you are comfortable with renting instead of buying, then this is an option.) The second option, the one we discarded because of the additional cost, is that I could have taken a loan, paying 4.5% interest to the bank, which would then pay under 1% to my mom, and keep the rest. Banks always want to make profit, and this profit has to come from somewhere - from the difference between the interest rates. If your dad has 230k on the bank, and you owe 230k to the bank, you are better off if you keep the bank out - at least as long as your dad is comfortable with lending you money, and you are comfortable with owing him money.

This can be a good option if you have good credit and can qualify for a mortgage with a favorable interest rate.Use a land contract: Another option is to use a land contract, also known as a contract for deed.

As a real estate agent myself, I believe his warnings were understated. As with any industry, there are good and bad people. Agents are paid to move houses. If the median US home is under $200K, and commissions average say 5%, the $10,000 to be gained is split between the buyer brokerage and selling agent. The $5000 to each is then shared with 'the house.' So, this sale would net me $2500, gross. Move one a week, and the income is great, one per month, not so much. Tire kickers will waste an agent's time for a potential decision to wait another year and continue renting. Their obligation is to tell you the truth, but not to offer financial advice.  Remember the mortgage crisis? It seems the banks and brokers aren't watching out for you either. They will tell you what they'll lend you, but not what you can afford. These numbers are worlds apart.  I strongly recommend a 20% downpayment. The FHA PMI calculator shows that a 90% LTV (i.e. a 10% downpayment) for a $100K house will cost you $1200/yr in PMI. Think about this. For the $10,000 that you didn't put down, you are paying an extra $1200 each year. This is on top of the interest, so even at 5%, that last $10,000 is costing nearly 17%. If you can't raise that $10K (or whatever 10% is on that house) in cheaper funds, you should hold off. Using the 401(k) loan for this purpose is appropriate, yet emotionally charged. As if suck loans are written by the devil himself.  \"Buy the biggest house you can\"? No. I have a better idea. Buy the smallest place you can tolerate. I have a living room (in addition to family room) that has been used 3 times in 20 years. A dining room we actually use. Twice per year.

It may also be helpful to get pre-approved for a mortgage, which will give you a better idea of how much you can borrow.Find a real estate agent: A real estate agent can help you navigate the process of buying a home, from finding properties that meet your needs to negotiating the final sale.

You can also drive around neighborhoods that you are interested in and look for \"for sale\" signs. Your real estate agent can also help you find homes that meet your needs.Make an offer: Once you have found a home that you want to buy, you will need to make an offer to the seller. Your real estate agent can help you determine a fair offer price based on comparable homes in the area. The seller will either accept, reject, or counter your offer.Get a home inspection: Before you finalize the purchase of the home, it's a good idea to have a professional home inspector check the condition of the property. The home inspector will look for any issues with the home, such as structural problems or problems with the plumbing or electrical systems.Get a mortgage: If you haven't already done so, you will need to get a mortgage to finance the purchase of the home. You can work with a lender to find a mortgage that meets your needs and budget.Finalize the purchase: Once you have a mortgage and the home inspection has been completed, you can finalize the purchase of the home.

If they also have a mix of investments some of which are international and depend on the strength of the dollar and some are domestic and do not, then they don't have to worry much about the strength/weakness of the dollar later when they sell their investments and buy what they want.  If the dollar is weak than the international goods will be more expensive, but at the same time international part of their portfolio will be worth more. If you plan on retiring in a different country or have 100% of your investments in emerging market stocks than it is worth thinking about either currency hedging or changing your investment mix.  However, for many people a good mix of domestic and international investments covers much of the risk that their currency will weaken while offering the benefits of diversification.

Currency risk arises because the value of the security can be affected by changes in the exchange rate between the foreign currency and your domestic currency. If the value of the foreign currency declines relative to your domestic currency, the value of the security denominated in that foreign currency will also decline in terms of your domestic currency. On the other hand, if the value of the foreign currency increases relative to your domestic currency, the value of the security denominated in that foreign currency will increase in terms of your domestic currency.Hedging currency risk can help to protect the value of your investment from fluctuations in the exchange rate. There are several ways to hedge currency risk, including using currency forwards, currency options, and currency ETFs. It is important to carefully consider your investment objectives and risk tolerance before deciding whether to hedge currency risk and, if so, how to do it.

Most countries (including member nations of the EU) limit some transactions like pre-IPO companies to \"accredited investors\".  3) Selling shares to the public also can allow the company to access more funds for growth. This is particularly important in a capital-intensive business like an airline; new B737-MAX costs >$110M. New A320neo costs >$105M USD.  Ultimately, the question of a successful IPO depends on how you define success. Initially, there was a lot of concern that the IPO was set up with too much focus on goal #2... allowing the management & owners to cash out.  It looks like the first approach was not meeting good opinions in the market during 2006. A major concern was that the initial approach focused on management only cashing out its shares and no money actually going to the company to support its future.  The investment bankers restructured the IPO, including the issuance of more new shares so that more $ could end up in the company's accounts, not just in the accounts of the management.  If anything, it's still a pretty successful IPO given that the shares were successfully listed, the company collected the money it needed to invest and grow, and the management still cashed out."}, {"label": 1, "content": "An initial public offering (IPO) is generally considered a failure if the stock price falls significantly below the offering price on the first day of trading and remains low in the following weeks or months.

Many successful companies have experienced a drop in their stock price after going public, only to see their stock price recover and rise over time. Conversely, a company's stock may initially perform well after an IPO but later decline due to various factors such as changes in market conditions or the company's financial performance.It's also worth noting that an IPO is just one way for a company to raise capital and is not necessarily the best option for every company.

This can help you demonstrate that you are able to borrow money responsibly and make regular payments on time.Rent an apartment or open utility accounts: If you are able to rent an apartment or open utility accounts in your own name, these actions can help you build your credit.

The risk from long-term bonds isn't that the government defaults, but that interest rates go up before you get paid, so investors want bonds issued more recently at higher interest rates, rather than your older bonds that pay at a lower rate (so the price for your bonds goes down). This is usually caused by higher inflation rates which reduce the value of the interest that you will be paid.

Your credit score is based on a variety of factors, including your payment history, credit utilization, length of credit history, and the types of credit you have. If you have a limited credit history or other negative factors on your credit report, paying off a car loan early may not have a significant impact on your credit score.It is always a good idea to make timely payments on your debts and to pay off your loans as soon as you can. This can help to improve your credit score and financial health over time. However, it is also important to maintain a healthy balance between paying off your debts and saving for the future.

The dividend yield is a measure of the annual dividend payment as a percentage of the stock price, while the payout ratio is the percentage of earnings that are paid out as dividends. A high dividend yield and a low payout ratio may indicate that a company has a strong financial position and is able to sustain its dividend payments.In addition to financial metrics, it can be helpful to look at the company's business model and industry trends when evaluating dividend stocks. Companies in stable industries with strong, predictable cash flows are often more likely to pay dividends consistently.It's also important to note that there are no guarantees when it comes to dividend stocks. While some companies have a long history of paying dividends, there is always the risk that a company may reduce or eliminate its dividend payments. This can be due to a variety of factors, including changing market conditions, financial difficulties, or shifts in the company's business strategy."}, {"label": 0, "content": "This is really an extended comment on the last paragraph of @BenMiller's answer. When (the manager of) a mutual fund sells securities that the fund holds for a profit, or receives dividends (stock dividends, bond interest, etc.), the fund has the option of paying taxes on that money (at corporate rates) and distributing the rest to shareholders in the fund, or passing on the entire amount (categorized as dividends, qualified dividends, net short-term capital gains, and net long-term capital gains) to the shareholders who then pay taxes on the money that they receive at their own respective tax rates. (If the net gains are negative, i.e. losses, they are not passed on to the shareholders. See the last paragraph below).  A shareholder doesn't have to reinvest the distribution amount into the mutual fund: the option of receiving the money as cash always exists, as does the option of investing the distribution into a different mutual fund in the same family, e.g. invest the distributions from Vanguard's S&P 500 Index Fund into Vanguard's Total Bond Index Fund (and/or vice versa). This last can be done without needing a brokerage account, but doing it across fund families will require the money to transit through a brokerage account or a personal account. Such cross-transfers can be helpful in reducing the amounts of money being transferred in re-balancing asset allocations as is recommended be done once or twice a year. Those investing in load funds instead of no-load funds should keep in mind that several load funds waive the load for re-investment of distributions but some funds don't: the sales charge for the reinvestment is pure profit for the fund if the fund was purchased directly or passed on to the brokerage if the fund was purchased through a brokerage account. As Ben points out, a shareholder in a mutual fund must pay taxes (in the appropriate categories) on the distributions  from the fund even though no actual cash has been received because the entire distribution has been reinvested. It is worth keeping in mind that when the mutual fund declares a distribution (say $1.22 a share), the Net Asset Value per share drops by the same amount (assuming no change in the prices of the securities that the fund holds) and the new shares issued are at this lower price. That is, there is no change in the value of the investment: if you had $10,000 in the fund the day before the distribution was declared, you still have $10,000 after the distribution is declared but you own more shares in the fund than you had previously. (In actuality, the new shares appear in your account a couple of days later, not immediately when the distribution is declared).  In short, a distribution  from a mutual fund that is re-invested leads to no change in your net assets, but does increase your tax liability. Ditto for a distribution that is taken as cash or re-invested elsewhere. As a final remark, net capital losses inside a mutual fund are not distributed to shareholders but are retained within the fund to be written off against future capital gains. See also this previous answer  or this one."}, {"label": 1, "content": "In the United States, capital gains taxes are generally owed when a capital asset, such as a stock or real estate, is sold for a profit. However, there are some exceptions to this rule.One exception is the \"wash sale\" rule, which applies to the sale of securities such as stocks or bonds. Under this rule, if an investor sells a security at a loss and then buys a substantially similar security within 30 days before or after the sale, the loss cannot be claimed on the investor's tax return. This rule is intended to prevent investors from engaging in tax-loss selling, in which they sell a security at a loss in order to claim a tax deduction, and then buy back the same security in order to continue holding it.Another exception is the \"like-kind exchange\" rule, which applies to the exchange of certain types of property, such as real estate. Under this rule, if an investor exchanges one piece of real estate for another without receiving any cash or other property in the process, the exchange is not considered a taxable event. However, this rule is limited to exchanges of real estate for other real estate, and does not apply to exchanges of other types of property.It's worth noting that these exceptions have certain requirements and limitations, and may not apply in all situations.

If certain requirements are met, the employee does not have to pay any tax on the difference between the grant price and the exercise price at the time the option is exercised. Instead, the employee pays tax when they sell the stock, and the difference between the grant price and the sale price is treated as a capital gain or loss. However, if the employee sells the stock before the end of a holding period (usually two years from the grant date and one year from the exercise date), the difference between the grant price and the sale price is treated as ordinary income, and the employee may also be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT).NSOs are granted to employees, independent contractors, and directors and are not entitled to the same favorable tax treatment as ISOs. When an NSO is exercised, the employee has to pay tax on the difference between the grant price and the exercise price as ordinary income, even if the option has not yet been sold.

When the option is sold, the difference between the sale price and the exercise price is treated as a capital gain or loss.Options that are not stock options, such as options on futures contracts or options on currencies, are taxed differently.

This is because in theory, a company can either pay dividends to investors [who can reinvest the funds themselves], or reinvest its capital and earn the same return on that reinvestment [and the shareholder still has the choice to sell a fraction of their holdings, if they prefer to have cash]. That theory may not match reality, because often companies pay or don't pay dividends based on their stage of life.  For example, early-stage mining companies often have no free cashflow to pay dividends [they are capital intensive until the mines are operational]. On the other side, longstanding companies may have no projects left that would be a  good fit for further investment, and so they pay out dividends instead, effectively allowing the shareholder to decide where to reinvest the money. Therefore, saying \"dividend paying\"/\"growth stock\" can be a proxy for talking about the stage of life + risk and return of a company. Saying dividend paying implies \"long-standing blue chip company with relatively low capital requirements and a stable business\". Likewise \"growth stocks\" [/ non-dividend paying] implies \"new startup company that still needs capital and thus is somewhat unproven, with a chance for good return to match the higher risk\". So in theory, dividend payment policy makes no difference. In practice, it makes a difference for two reasons: (1) You will most likely be taxed differently on selling stock vs receiving dividends [Which one is better for you is a specific question relying on your jurisdiction, your current income, and things like what type of stock / how long you hold it]. For example in Canada, if you earn ~ < $40k, your dividends are very likely to have a preferential tax treatment to selling shares for capital gains [but your province and specific other numbers would influence this]. In the United States, I believe capital gains are usually preferential as long as you hold the shares for a long time [but I am not 100% on this without looking it up]. (2) Dividend policy implies differences in the stage of life / risk level of a stock. This implication is not guaranteed, so be sure you are using other considerations to determine whether this is the case.

These stocks provide a regular stream of cash payments that can be used to supplement your income or reinvested to generate more returns. Growth stocks, on the other hand, may not pay dividends at all or may pay very small dividends. Instead, these stocks offer the potential for capital appreciation as the company grows and its stock price increases.Risk tolerance: Dividend stocks tend to be less risky than growth stocks because they offer a steady stream of income that can help to cushion the impact of market fluctuations. Growth stocks, on the other hand, tend to be more volatile and carry more risk. The potential for high returns is there, but so is the potential for significant losses.Time horizon: If you have a long-term investment horizon, growth stocks may be a good choice.

I offer this anecdote to share a 'deduction' story - The first year I did my MIL's taxes, I had to explain that she didn't   have enough deductions to itemize. Every year since, she hands me a   file full of paper substantiating medical deductions that don't exceed   7.5% of her income. In turn, I give her two folders back, one with the 5 or so documents I needed, and the rest labeled \"trash\". Fewer than 30% of filers itemize. And a good portion of those that do, have no question that's the right thing to do. e.g. my property tax is more than the $12K, so anything else I have that's a deduction adds right to the number.  It's really just those people who are at the edge that are likely frustrated. I wrote an article regarding Standard Deduction vs Itemizing, in which I describe a method of pulling in one's deductible expenses into Odd years, reducing the number in Even years, to allow a bi-annual itemization. If this is your situation, you'll find the concept interesting.  You also ask about filing status. Think on this for a minute. After pulling in our W2s (TurboTax imports the data right from ADP), I do the same for our stock info. The stock info, and all Schedule A deductions aren't assigned a name. So any effort to split them in search of savings by using Married Filing Separate, would first require splitting these up. TurboTax has a 'what-if' worksheet for this function, but when the 'marriage penalty' was lifted years ago, the change in status had no value. Items that phaseout over certain income levels are often lost to the separate filer anyway. When I got married, I found my real estate losses each year could not be taken, they accumulated until I either sold, or until our income dropped when the Mrs retired.

When the supply of money increases faster than the supply of goods and services, prices tend to rise, resulting in inflation. On the other hand, when the supply of goods and services increases faster than the supply of money, prices tend to fall, resulting in deflation.Inflation is generally measured using a price index, such as the consumer price index (CPI), which measures the average price of a basket of goods and services consumed by households. The rate of inflation is calculated by comparing the price index in one period to the price index in a previous period and expressing the difference as a percentage.

The difference is that the bond holder has the option to exchange the debt for equity at some point during the life of the bond.  There can be restrictions on when that conversion is possible, and they typically define a quantity of equity (number of shares) that the bond can be converted into.  If the market price of the shares goes above a price that would make the shares more valuable than the bond, it's in the best interest of the bond holder to convert. A convertible note is typically used to describe a kind of startup financing that does not pay interest or have a face value that's redeemed, but instead is redeemed for equity as part of a later financing round.  Rather than specifying a specific number of shares, the bond holder receives equity at a certain discount to the rest of the market.

We also find little evidence that weekend returns are driven by higher levels of risk over the weekend.  \"The effect is particularly strong over expiration weekends, and it is also present to a lesser degree over mid-week holidays.

Options prices are determined by a number of factors, including the underlying stock price, the time remaining until the option's expiration date, and the option's implied volatility. After-hours trading refers to buying and selling activity that occurs outside of regular trading hours, which are typically from 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM Eastern Time on weekdays.During after-hours trading, the price of the underlying stock may fluctuate based on news or other events that occur outside of regular trading hours. This can, in turn, affect the price of the options that are tied to that stock. For example, if the price of the underlying stock goes up during after-hours trading, the price of a call option (which gives the holder the right to buy the stock at a specific price) may also go up, while the price of a put option (which gives the holder the right to sell the stock at a specific price) may go down.It's important to note that after-hours trading is typically less liquid than regular trading hours, which means that there may be wider spreads between the bid and ask prices for options.

Be sure to include contingencies in your offer that allow you to conduct due diligence, such as inspections and appraisals, before the sale is finalized.Perform due diligence: Before you finalize the purchase, it's important to thoroughly inspect the property to ensure it's in good condition and that there are no hidden issues. You should also have the property appraised to ensure you're paying a fair price.Secure any necessary permits: Once you've finalized the purchase, you'll need to secure any necessary permits for the demolition and construction work you plan to do.Demolish the old house: Once you've obtained the necessary permits, you can begin the process of tearing down the old house. Depending on the size and complexity of the project, you may want to hire a professional demolition company to handle this part of the process.Build the new house: Once the old house has been demolished, you can begin the process of building the new one.

The borrower will then be required to make payments on the loan in addition to their mortgage payments.In summary, a protected-equity loan is a type of mortgage in which the borrower shares in the appreciation or depreciation of the property with the lender, while an equity loan is a type of loan in which the borrower uses the equity in their property as collateral to borrow money."}, {"label": 0, "content": "If you can pay it then there's no need to involve a credit counselor.  After all, their main role when you use them is to negotiate payments with creditors so you can pay off your debts.  In this case you have the funds to pay, so why make it any more complicated than it needs to be? To be honest, a 597 score is going to make it tough for you to find auto financing.  Whatever options you find, they'll charge pretty steep interest rates and have high payments because they'll keep you on as short a payment term as your finances will allow.  I would strongly suggest that you work on improving your score for awhile before trying to buy a car.  If you can, buy a car for cash.  You might not get much, but it will solve your transportation problem while you work on resolving your credit issues. Using a credit counselor won't have any impact on your credit score as far as the debts are concerned.  What will make a difference is not having them show as open collections, which is pretty bad.  You'll still take a hit for having gone to collections in the first place, but paying them off will mitigate at least some of the effect. I hope this helps. Good luck!"}, {"label": 1, "content": "Paying off collections can be an effective way to improve your credit score and financial situation. Here are a few steps you can take to pay off your collections:Make a list of all your collections accounts. Include the creditor's name, the amount owed, and the date the account went into collections.Determine how much you can afford to pay each month. Be realistic and consider your other financial obligations and living expenses.Prioritize your collections accounts. Start by paying off the accounts with the highest interest rates or the ones that are negatively impacting your credit score the most.Negotiate with your creditors. Try to negotiate a lower payoff amount or a payment plan that you can afford. If you are unable to negotiate a favorable resolution, you may want to consider seeking the assistance of a credit counselor or debt settlement company.Make your payments on time. Paying your collections accounts on time is important to improving your credit score.Monitor your credit report. Once you have paid off a collections account, make sure it is reflected on your credit report. If it is not, you may need to dispute the error with the credit bureau.Remember, it is important to address your collections accounts as soon as possible to minimize the negative impact they can have on your credit score and financial well-being."}, {"label": 0, "content": "There's a whole industry devoted to this.

Is the price of the last trade. It indicates what one particular buyer and seller agreed upon. There is absolutely no requirement that one of them didn't offer too much or demand too little, so this is nearly meaningless as an indication of what anyone else will be willing to offer or demand. An average of trades across a sufficiently large number of transactions might indicate a rough consensus about the value of a stock, but transactions will be clustered around that average and the average itself moves over time. Either you offer to sell or buy at a particular price, wait for that price, and risk the transaction not taking place at all if nobody agrees, or you do a spot transaction and get the best price at that nanosecond (which may not be the best in the next nanosecond). Or you tell the broker what the limits are that you consider acceptable, trading these risks off against each other. Pick the one which comes closest to your intent and ignore the fact that others may be getting a slightly different price. That's just the way the market works. \"If his price is lower, why didn't you buy it there?\" \"He's out of stock.\" \"Well, come back when I'm out of stock and I'll be unable to sell it to you for an even better price!\""}, {"label": 1, "content": "If the price of a security has changed in the after-hours market, you can place an order to buy or sell the security at the current price when the market reopens.

The USA has a high number of the world's largest businesses and there are correlations between equity markets. So you need to think of equities as a global asset class, not regional. Your question is then a question about the correlation between equity markets and currency markets.  Here's a guess: If equity markets crashed, you would see a lot of panic selling of stocks denominated in many currencies, but probably the most in USD, due to the large number of the world's largest businesses trading on US stock exchanges. Therefore, when the rest of the world sells US equities they receive cash USD, which they might sell for their local currency. That selling pressure would cause USD to fall. But, when equity markets crash there's a move to safety of the bond markets. The world's largest bond markets are denominated in which currency? Probably USD. So those who receive USD for their equities are going to spend that USD on bonds. In which case there is probably no correlation between equity markets and currency markets at all.

However, it's important to keep in mind that investing in other currencies carries its own set of risks, and it's not a guarantee against losses.The value of a currency is determined by a variety of factors, including economic conditions, political stability, and interest rates. When the value of a currency fluctuates, it can affect the value of your investments. For example, if you invest in a foreign currency and the value of that currency declines relative to your domestic currency, the value of your investment may also decline.It's also important to note that currency trading is a highly speculative and complex activity, and it may not be suitable for all investors. It's important to thoroughly research and understand the risks before making any investment decisions.In general, it's a good idea to diversify your investment portfolio by including a mix of asset classes, including stocks, bonds, and cash.

Here are some potential pros and cons of using per diem compensation:Pros:Per diem payments can be an efficient way to compensate employees for expenses related to their work, as they do not require itemized receipts or other documentation.Per diem payments can be easier for employees to budget and manage, as they know exactly how much they will be receiving upfront.For employers, per diem payments can be a more cost-effective way to compensate employees for business expenses, as they do not have to track and reimburse individual expenses.Cons:Per diem payments may not fully cover all of an employee's expenses, particularly if they are in a location with higher costs of living.Per diem payments are generally taxable, so employees will need to pay taxes on the amount they receive.Some employees may prefer to have their expenses reimbursed directly, rather than receiving a per diem payment.In terms of taxation, per diem payments are generally taxable as income. However, there are some exceptions to this rule, such as if the employee is required to work away from home overnight and their employer does not provide them with lodging. In this case, the per diem payment may be tax-free up to the maximum federal per diem rate for the location. It's important to note that the rules for taxation of per diem payments can vary depending on the specific circumstances, so employees and employers should consult with a tax professional or refer to IRS guidelines for more information."}]
