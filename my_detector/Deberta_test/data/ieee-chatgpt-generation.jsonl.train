The overheating of the switchgear contacts is the main cause of the failure of the switchgear. Since the switchgear is relatively closed so that the internal contacts cannot be directly measured, which need to push out the contact status through a portion that is easy to measure. Therefore, this paper uses the collected temperature of the infrared window to push out the contacts temperature based on the BP neural network to determine whether the switchgear contacts are faulty. Firstly, the ANSYS Workbench finite element software is used to simulate the switchgear and obtain the contacts temperature and infrared window measurement temperature as the BP neural network test data. Then, the BP neural network model is trained to determine the model parameters. Finally, the trained BP model is used to test and determine the accuracy of the fault diagnosis of the switchgear contacts based on the BP model. The experimental results show that the maximum error between the expected data and the predicted data based on the BP neural network model does not exceed 1. 5 \u00b0C, which is within the normal range.

One of two forms of elasticity is often adopted. While horizontal elasticity is concerned with the acquisition and release of computational nodes in accordance with demand, vertical elasticity focuses on the distribution of a node's resources among its hosted virtual machines (VMs) or containers, by adjusting the capacity of the resource types allocated to each individual VM in accordance with its respective application's needs. In the case of vertical elasticity, when insufficient resources are available to allocate to a given VM, its application's performance may suffer degradation. For online applications, the only alternative is to live-migrate the VM to another server. On the other hand, when running batch jobs, the resource-constrained VM could also be suspended or saved to disk and revived elsewhere or on the same host, when resources become available. Given that memory availability has a significant influence on performance and system throughput, this paper investigates the viability of integrating VM migration, pausing and suspension schemes as part of a VM scheduling strategy to support the execution of both online and batch applications in a virtualized infrastructure employing memory elasticity.

Characterizing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals of the patient is an effective way for the early prediction of epileptic seizures. In this paper, a new method called the entropy of visibility heights of hierarchical neighbors (EVHHN) is proposed to detect seizures from the EEG signals. First, the visibility relationships of three nearest neighbors are determined by a visibility criterion. Then, we compute the visibility heights of three nearest neighbors for each data point. Next, the four different kinds of entropy associated with neighbor visibility states are calculated to characterize the EEG signals and finally these features are validated by LS-SVM classifiers. In the experiment, the normal and ictal EEG signals are classified with the accuracy of 99.6%, meanwhile, the interictal and ictal EEG signals are distinguished with the accuracy of 98.35%, which proves the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Furthermore, the establishment of large scale Cloud data centers due to the fast growth of utility-based IT services made the energy usage of data centers a concern. Cloud data centers use load balancing algorithms to allocate their physical resources (CPU, memory, hard disk, network bandwidth) efficiently on demand and hence optimize their energy consumption. In the load balancing process, some Virtual Machines (VMs) are selected from over-or under-utilized physical hosts and these VMs are migrated, while live and running, to other hosts. This live migration can result in Service Level Agreement Violations (SLAVs) and consequently low Quality of Service (QoS). Thus, in this paper, we propose an energy aware VM selection policy to minimize the number of migrations and consequently decrease SLAVs. Load balancing has three stages: a) Detecting over-and under-utilized hosts; b) Selecting one or more VMs for migration from those hosts; c) Finding destination hosts for the selected VMs. The focus of this research is on the VM selection stage of CPU load balancing. Our proposed VM selection algorithm considers CPU utilization of the VMs on each host and any linear correlation between the CPU usage of the VMs. The algorithm was evaluated on two different real Cloud data sets provided by the CoMon project and Google.

Since the IM calculates the assigned velocity for a CAV based on the model of the CAV, it's vulnerable to model mismatches and possible external disturbances. As a result, IM must consider a large safety buffer around all CAVs to ensure a safe scheduling, which greatly degrades the throughput. In addition, IM has to assign a relatively lower speed to CAVs that intend to make a turn at the intersection to avoid rollover. This issue reduces the throughput of the intersection even more. In this paper, we propose a space and time-aware technique to manage intersections of CAVs that is robust against external disturbances and model mismatches. In our method, RIM, IM is responsible for assigning a safe Time of Arrival (TOA) and Velocity of Arrival (VOA) to an approaching CAV such that trajectories of CAVs before and inside the intersection does not conflict. Accordingly, CAVs are responsible for determining and tracking an optimal trajectory to reach the intersection at the assigned TOA while driving at VOA. Since CAVs track a position trajectory, the effect of bounded model mismatch and external disturbances can be compensated. In addition, CAVs that intend to make a turn at the intersection do not need to drive at a slow velocity before entering the intersection. Results from conducting experiments on a 1/10 scale intersection of CAVs show that RIM can reduce the position error at the expected TOA by 18X on average in presence of up to 10% model mismatch and an external disturbance with an amplitude of 5% of max range.

Optical Burst Switched (OBS) backbone networks are handling the resultant volumes of such traffic by transmitting it in huge size chunks called bursts. Because of the lack or limited buffering capabilities within the core network, contentions as well as congestion may frequently occur and thus affecting overall supportable quality of service (QoS). Both contention and congestion will be characterized by frequent burst losses especially when traffic levels surge. The congestion is normally resolved by way of deflecting contending bursts to other less congested paths even though this may lead to differential delays incurred by bursts as they traverse the network. This will contribute to undesirable jitter that may ultimately compromise overall QoS. Noting that jitter is mostly caused by deflection routing which itself is a result of poor wavelength and routing assigning, in this paper we propose a controllable deflection routing (CDR) scheme that allows the deflection of bursts to alternate paths only after controller buffer preset thresholds are surpassed. In this way bursts intended for a common destination are always most likely to be routed on the same or least cost path end-to-end. We describe the scheme as well as compare its performance to other existing approaches.

In order to utilize current 2D video compression standards, such content must be projected onto a 2D image plane. However, the projection from spherical to 2D domain introduces deformations in the projected content due to the different sampling characteristics of the 2D plane. Such deformations are not favorable for the motion models of the current video coding standards. Consequently, omnidirectional video is not efficiently compressible with current codecs. In this work, a geometry-based motion vector scaling method is proposed in order to compress the motion information of omnidirectional content efficiently.

Specially, a remote sensing system consisting of a sensor, an encoder and a decoder is configured to observe, transmit, and recover a discrete time stochastic process. At each time step, the sensor makes an observation on the state variable of the stochastic process. The sensor is constrained by the number of transmissions over the time horizon, and thus it needs to decide whether to transmit its observation or not after making each measurement. If the sensor decides to transmit, it sends the observation to the encoder, who then encodes and transmits the observation to the decoder. Otherwise, the sensor and the encoder maintain silence. The decoder is required to generate a real-time estimate on the state variable. The sensor, the encoder, and the decoder collaborate to minimize the sum of the communication cost for the sensor, the encoding cost for the encoder, and the estimation error for the decoder.

The linear search classification algorithm assigns each packet according to its prior actions, which are determined by comparing the packet header with classification rules until a match is found. As the processing latency of packet classification is proportional to the number of rules, a large number of rules can result in serious communication delay. This problem is generalized to Optimal Rule Ordering (ORO), which aims to identify the rule ordering that minimizes the delay caused by packet classification. If two different rules match a single packet, conventional ORO does not allow the posterior rule to be placed in a higher position than the prior rule. However, interchanging the rules does not violate the policy if the actions of those rules are the same. Thus, in this paper, we specifically consider the Relaxed Optimal Rule Ordering (RORO) problem, in which rules can be interchanged if their actions are the same. In RORO, the weight of rules may vary as they are interchanged. Hence, we propose a method of calculating the weights using a zero-suppressed binary decision diagram.

High substation automations with reliable communication avoid the traditional complicated operation which needs to be done manually, and improve the efficiency of substation operation.

The protection setting of intelligent substation directly affects the correctness of the protection devices (Intelligent Electronic Device) and further affects the normal operation of the entire power system.

Error probability in the received message characterizes the communication channel quality at a definite period of time required for the radio line adaptation to the communication conditions. An immediate estimation of the error probability requires a lot of time, which in many cases exceeds the communication channel stationary interval and makes it impossible to provide operational adaptation of the radio line to the continuously changing communication conditions.

To preserve more of the structure information, the filter response vectors are decomposed into two complementary components, namely, the signs and the magnitudes, which are further encoded separately into binary codes. The local mean pixels of the 3D blocks are also converted into binary codes. Finally, three types of binary codes are combined via joint or hybrid histograms for the final feature representation.

However, users may worry that their real locations and other privacy information will leak out when they get such services, so appropriate location privacy protection measures are necessary. Traditional location privacy protection, such as K-anonymous, cannot be carried out directly because of the characteristics of vehicle networks, such as high mobility. In order to solve such problems, this article proposes a strategy combining cache strategy with K-anonymous that can not only satisfy users' demand on obtaining required services with lowest cost, but also protect the location privacy of users. Specifically, on one hand, cache strategy that deploys part of services on roadside units in advance is used to maximize the satisfaction of users' service requests. On the other hand, each user is set with a K value to meet the need of K-anonymous. The trade-off of these two aspects guarantees users' services and the location privacy.

An important factor to consider when allocating resources, in these situations, is the critical infrastructures' interdependencies. i2Sim, the Infrastructures' Interdependencies Simulator, is a tool build for that purpose. As a layered architecture, i2Sim includes a dedicated decision-making layer. The use of Reinforcement Learning (RL), a machine learning approach based on an agent learning from experience, has been successfully tested with some dimensionality constraints. This paper introduces two improvements to our previous tests aiming at increasing speed and allowing larger dimensionality problems. The first addition is an improved reward scheme for speeding up convergence while guaranteeing it. The correct application of shaping rewards requires a deep understanding of the problem and extensive convergence tests. The second improvement added is the implementation of a scheduler programmed to trigger multiple instances of the same model using different parameters. This scheduler partitions the state space, enabling the agent's training to be done in parallel via a distributed RL algorithm. With this idea, the state/action matrix representing knowledge is partitioned for training, assigned to computing nodes, populated with knowledge (trained) and collected/reconstructed for use.

Computational resources (i.e., CPU, memory, disk, etc.) are distributed according to the Dominant Resource Fairness (DRF) policy. Mesos frameworks (users) receive resources based on their current usage and are responsible for scheduling their tasks within the allocation. We have observed that multiple frameworks can cause fairness imbalance in a multi-user environment. For example, a greedy framework consuming more than its fair share of resources can deny resource fairness to others. The user with the least Dominant Share is considered first by the DRF module to get its resource allocation. However, the default DRF implementation, in Apache Mesos' Master allocation module, does not consider the overall resource demands of the tasks in the queue for each user/framework. This lack of awareness can lead to poor performance as users without any pending task may receive more resource offers, and users with a queue of pending tasks can starve due to their high dominant shares. In a multi-tenant environment, the characteristics of frameworks and workloads must be understood by cluster managers to be able to define fairness based on not only resource share but also resource demand and queue wait time. We have developed a policy driven queue manager, Tromino, for an Apache Mesos cluster where tasks for individual frameworks can be scheduled based on each framework's overall resource demands and current resource consumption. Dominant Share and demand awareness of Tromino and scheduling based on these attributes can reduce (1) the impact of unfairness due to a framework specific configuration, and (2) unfair waiting time due to higher resource demand in a pending task queue.

In this paper, we propose a novel approach for undirected networks, which can enable secure and privacy-preserving average consensus in a decentralized architecture in the absence of an aggregator or third party. By leveraging partial homomorphic cryptography to embed secrecy in pairwise interaction dynamics, our approach can guarantee convergence to the consensus value (subject to a quantization error) in a deterministic manner without disclosing a node's state to its neighbors. We provide a new privacy definition for dynamical systems, and give a new framework to rigorously prove that a node's privacy can be protected as long as it has at least one legitimate neighbor, which follows the consensus protocol faithfully without attempts to infer other nodes' states. In addition to enabling resilience to passive attackers aiming to steal state information, the approach also allows easy incorporation of defending mechanisms against active attackers who try to alter the content of exchanged messages. Furthermore, in contrast to existing noise-injection-based privacy-preserving mechanisms that have to reconfigure the entire network when the topology or number of nodes varies, our approach is applicable to dynamic environments with time-varying coupling topologies.

In this paper, we propose the asynchronous scheduling which is based on the fractional pilot reuse so that the users can be free from the pilot contamination during the uplink transmission. According to the level of interference, the users are divided into two groups, which are referred as the center users, who suffer from the mild pilot contamination, and the edge users, who suffer from the severe pilot contamination. Based on this distinction, a cell-center pilot set is reused for all the center users in all cells, whereas a cell-edge pilot set is applied for the edge users in the adjacent cells. In this case, the pilots used by the cell-edge users are orthogonal to each other. So the edge users can transmit the pilots at any time.

This method uses a natural image prior and integrates Bayes methods to address the challenges associated with single image super resolution, which include the presence of noise, loss of high-frequency information, and insufficient image resolution. Interpolation techniques may fail to efficiently estimate high-frequency components, particularly when the noise level is high, thus the use of multi-frame image super resolution is critical. To determine the level of noise, noise measurement and computational modeling have been used in previous studies, which involve the estimation of noise variance and the use of statistical analysis to optimize the image reconstruction process. The proposed natural image prior-based multi-frame image super resolution technique is efficient, precise, and minimizes errors during image reconstruction."}, {"label": 1, "content": "This paper proposes a direction finding algorithm for noncircular signals in the presence of unknown mutual coupling.
