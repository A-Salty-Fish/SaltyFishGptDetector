Most children outgrow bedwetting on their own, and treatment is usually not necessary. However, if your child's bedwetting is causing distress or problems, there are several things you can try to help your child stop wetting the bed:\n\nEncourage your child to go to the bathroom before bedtime and make sure they empty their bladder completely.\n\nConsider using an alarm system to wake your child up when they start to wet the bed. These alarms can be purchased online or at a medical supply store.\n\nTry to reduce your child's fluid intake in the evening, particularly caffeine-containing drinks like soda and chocolate.\n\nConsider using a bedwetting product, such as a moisture-absorbing mattress pad or a bedwetting alarm that attaches to your child's clothing.\n\nTalk to your child's doctor about whether medication might be helpful in managing the bedwetting.\n\nIt's important to be patient and understanding with your child as they learn to control their bladder.

Avoid using harsh soaps or detergents on the skin, as these can be irritating.\n\nApply a cool compress to the affected area to help reduce itching and inflammation.\n\nAvoid activities that may cause sweating in the affected area.\n\nAvoid scratching the affected area, as this can make the rash worse and lead to infection.\n\nUse over-the-counter (OTC) creams or ointments, such as hydrocortisone cream, to help reduce itching and inflammation.\n\nIf the rash does not improve within a few days, or if you have other symptoms such as fever or lymph node swelling, you should see a healthcare provider for further evaluation and treatment.

It is reassuring knowing you were bitten by your own dog as opposed to a feral dog because wild dogs carry much more bacteria and even rabies.  The use of antibiotics for prophylactics is controversial.  The first-line oral therapy is amoxicillin-clavulanate. For higher-risk infections, a first dose of antibiotic may be given intravenously.

You can use rubbing alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or iodine.\n\nCover the wound with a sterile bandage. This will help keep it clean and protected.\n\nKeep the wound elevated.
