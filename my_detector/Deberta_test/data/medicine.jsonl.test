It is basically used for egg release (ovulation) where natural ovulation is a problem. It is in particular useful in Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome where the follicles are maturing to varied extent and still the ovulation failure is noted. Clomiphene citrate is also having antioestrogenic effect. So it may hamper  growth of endometrium. Hence, in women where Endometrial growth is low, gonadotropin hormones may be preferred for induction of ovulation. Endometrial thickness between 9 mm to 13 mm has proved to be most conducive for implantation of fertilized ovum or blastocyst. Ovulation occurring when endometrium is just 5.7 mm is likely to end in 'no pregnancy'.So long as the follicular size is concerned, it has been reported for many decades that the ova discharged from the follicles of size between 18 mm to 21 mm are the healthiest one and give maximum fertilization rate and continuation of pregnancy success rate. Progynova is a synthetic hormone replacement for oestrogen. It is used to build up the lining of the uterus in preparation for embryo transfer during a thaw cycle for women who do not ovulate regularly. Hence in your case, it might prove to be effective in building up the endometrium. However, you should not wait for the ovulation beyond the follicular size more than 21 mm. If it takes longer for the endometrium to grow, you may waste this cycle and start Progynova earlier in next cycle and have ovulation at proper follicular size.

Scaling is a procedure that removes plaque and tartar from the surface of the teeth, and it can be performed by a dentist or dental hygienist. However, it's important to understand that scaling is not always the solution for yellow teeth. There are a number of other factors that can cause teeth to turn yellow, such as:\n\nAging: As we get older, our teeth naturally become less white due to wear and tear and exposure to staining agents like coffee, tea, and tobacco.\n\nMedications: Some medications, such as tetracycline, can cause tooth discoloration.\n\nPoor oral hygiene: Poor oral hygiene can lead to a build-up of plaque and tartar on the teeth, which can cause them to turn yellow.\n\nTrauma: Teeth can become discolored if they have been traumatized, such as by a blow to the mouth.\n\nIf you have yellow teeth, it's important to visit a dentist to determine the cause and the best course of treatment.

It is not a specific test for any particular disease, but it can be elevated in a variety of conditions, including infections, inflammation, and certain types of cancer. It is not uncommon for ESR to increase slightly in response to an infection, as the body's immune system responds to the infection by releasing substances that can cause inflammation.\n\nThere are several reasons why ESR may increase after starting antibiotics:\n\nThe infection is causing inflammation: As mentioned above, ESR can be elevated in response to inflammation, and infections can often cause inflammation. If the infection is causing inflammation, then ESR may increase as the body's immune system responds to the infection.\n\nThe antibiotics are causing inflammation: Some antibiotics can cause inflammation as a side effect. This is not a common side effect, but it is possible. If the antibiotics you are taking are causing inflammation, then ESR may increase as a result.\n\nThe infection is not responding to the antibiotics: If the infection is not responding to the antibiotics, then ESR may continue to increase despite treatment. This could be due to a number of factors, such as antibiotic resistance or an underlying condition that is making it difficult for the antibiotics to work effectively.\n\nIt is important to note that ESR is not a specific test for infection, and the presence of an infection does not necessarily mean that ESR will be elevated. Similarly, an increase in ESR does not necessarily mean that an infection is present. It is important to discuss any concerns or questions you have about your ESR with your healthcare provider.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) can help reduce inflammation and slow the progression of the disease. Physical therapy, exercise, and assistive devices such as canes or splints can also be helpful in managing the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nHeadache: There are many different types of headaches, and treatment will depend on the specific type and severity of the headache. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can often be effective in relieving mild to moderate headaches. More severe headaches may require prescription medications or other treatments. It's important to speak with a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate treatment for your specific headache.\n\nJaw pain: Jaw pain can be caused by a variety of factors, including teeth grinding, jaw injury, or temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorder. Treatment will depend on the underlying cause of the jaw pain. In some cases, over-the-counter pain relievers or ice packs can help reduce inflammation and relieve discomfort. Other treatments may include physical therapy, bite guards, or medication to relax the muscles in the jaw.\n\nLow blood pressure: Low blood pressure, also known as hypotension, can be caused by a variety of factors, including dehydration, certain medications, and underlying medical conditions. Treatment for low blood pressure may include increasing fluid intake, increasing salt intake, and taking medications to raise blood pressure. It's important to speak with a healthcare professional to determine the appropriate treatment for your specific case of low blood pressure.\n\nTinnitus: Tinnitus is the perception of noise or ringing in the ears that is not caused by an external source. There is no cure for tinnitus, but there are several treatment options that can help manage the symptoms. These may include sound therapy, counseling, and medications to relieve anxiety or depression.

This can be either a sick nerve or a nerve that has had an injury. Electrical, shooting would be others implying nerve source for pain.Location of pain: There is a lot to this. First, if something goes in the pathway of a nerve, then that is the nerve involved. Nerves are long and the pain is in a belt-like long pathway. Smaller areas are smaller nerves. This also tends to say what might be going on. Obviously if there was an injury to the area and then there was pain outward from it \"hit a nerve\" would be a possibility. Sick nerves are multiple areas and tend to be the TIPS of the nerve not the whole nerve.What hurts: Moving a particular way that triggers the pain tells what is hurting. Specifically it can distinguish outward structures like skin, muscles, tendons, joints from deep structures like organs and nerves.There is the pain. There is the context of it. If it is getting less that is perceived as good regardless of the pain. If the patient is making a lot of pain, then after the patient, the pain is less.Pain exists, at multiple levels of abstraction. There is how it is held.

Metformin helps bring down the levels of Insulin. It acts as a good adjuvant to the medicines used for induction of ovulation. The success of only Metformin for the treatment of anovulatory infertility is questionable. According to some scientists, Myo inositol brings down the levels of Insulin as well as androgens and hence is more effective in the treatment of infertility due to PCOS. For induction of ovulation, Clomiphene citrate may be tried for 6 cycles (along with Metformin or Myo inositol). If it fails, HMG/hCG combination may be tried. PCOS is characterised by obesity.

However, the evidence is not strong and more research is needed to confirm these findings.\n\nMetformin is a medication commonly used to treat type 2 diabetes and PCOS.

I know the virus does not survive in insects, but what if some mosquito bites a very high viral load HIV-infected person and then bites an uninfected person on his wound, who crushes it on his wound. If the above situation happens at three or four places on his body simultaneously by an HIV-infected mosquito, what is the possibility of HIV transmission by this method?\nThere is no risk of HIV transmission through mosquitoes. HIV is a virus that affects humans and other primates, and it cannot replicate or survive in the bodies of insects such as mosquitoes. Mosquitoes do not transmit HIV when they bite humans.\n\nIn fact, HIV cannot survive outside the body for very long. The virus is fragile and is easily damaged by exposure to air, heat, and light. Therefore, it is not possible for HIV to be transmitted through mosquitoes or any other type of insect.\n\nIt is important to note that HIV is primarily transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, such as blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and breast milk.

It is more common in women, but it can also affect men. Melasma can be difficult to treat and may require a combination of treatments to be effective.\n\nHere are some steps you can take to help reduce the appearance of melasma:\n\nWear sunscreen: It is important to protect your skin from the sun, as exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light can worsen melasma. Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 and apply it to your face and other exposed skin every day.\n\nAvoid certain triggers: Certain things can trigger or worsen melasma, such as certain skin care products, hormones (including birth control pills and hormone replacement therapy), and certain medications. Try to identify any potential triggers and avoid them if possible.\n\nUse lightening agents: Several topical lightening agents are available that can help to lighten the appearance of melasma. These include hydroquinone, azelaic acid, kojic acid, and vitamin C. These agents can be used alone or in combination with other treatments.\n\nConsider chemical peels: Chemical peels can help to remove the top layers of skin, revealing brighter, smoother skin underneath.

But don't soap-wash more than once a day. Doing so can increase dryness.Always wipe from front to back after having a bowel movement.Wear cotton panties (no synthetic fabrics), and change your underwear every day.Stay away from hot bath tubs and avoid whirlpool baths.No swimming until you get better.Do not douche. Douching removes the healthy and normal bacteria in the vagina that actually protect you from infections.Wear loose clothes; and, no pantyhose.Use condoms during sexual intercourse to prevent sexually transmitted diseases.If you are experiencing vaginal dryness, use a vaginal moisturizer. Apply a water-based lubricant (K-Y, Astroglide) before having sex.Avoid sexual intercourse until your symptoms improve.Limit the number of sexual-partner.Don't scratch -- you can further irritate the area.Apply Clotrimazole/Hydrocortisone vaginal cream for prompt relief. Get yourself checked for any STDs. Take Loratadine by mouth if you also have got itching around the genitals.May you get very well soon and have a wonderful time ahead.

If you must use heat styling tools, make sure to use a heat protectant product and keep the heat setting at a moderate level.\n\nAvoid tight hairstyles: Tight hairstyles, such as ponytails or cornrows, can put a lot of tension on your hair and lead to breakage. Try to wear your hair in loose styles that don't put too much pressure on your hair.\n\nUse a gentle shampoo and conditioner: Choose products that are formulated for damaged or sensitive hair. Avoid sulfates, which can strip the hair of its natural oils, and look for products that contain nourishing ingredients like keratin, biotin, and vitamins.\n\nTry a hair mask or treatment: Hair masks and treatments can help to moisturize and nourish your hair, improving its strength and elasticity. Look for products that contain natural ingredients like avocado, olive oil, or coconut oil.\n\nEat a healthy diet: A healthy diet that includes a variety of nutrients, including proteins, vitamins, and minerals, can help to support healthy hair growth. Foods like eggs, nuts, and leafy greens are particularly good for maintaining healthy hair.\n\nAvoid harsh chemicals: Avoid using harsh chemicals, such as hair dyes and relaxers, on your hair.

It is typically done to help diagnose and treat problems with blood flow, such as blockages or narrowing of the vessels. The procedure involves inserting a thin, flexible tube called a catheter into a blood vessel, usually in the arm or leg, and injecting a dye that can be seen on x-ray images.\n\nWarfarin is a medication that is used to prevent blood clots from forming. It works by inhibiting the production of certain proteins that are involved in the blood clotting process. Warfarin is often prescribed to people who are at risk of developing blood clots, such as those with a history of heart attack, stroke, or certain types of arrhythmias.\n\nIf your father has been taking warfarin for a long time and has recently stopped taking the medication in preparation for the angiogram, it is possible that his blood may be more prone to clotting than usual. However, this does not necessarily mean that the angiogram will be risky or that there will be any complications. The medical team performing the procedure will take steps to ensure the safety of your father during the procedure, such as monitoring his vital signs and administering medications as needed. It is important for your father to follow any pre-procedure instructions provided by the medical team and to inform them of any medications he is taking, including warfarin."}, {"label": 0, "content": "Hello dear, thanks for your question on HCM.

If he is suffering side effects in his eyes he should immediately advise his doctor about this who will give him further instructions on the medication.  Arm exercises really have no relationship to the use of this medication which is for a pulmonary condition. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."}, {"label": 1, "content": "VERTINE (betahistine) is a medication used to treat symptoms of vertigo (a sensation of spinning or dizziness) and other balance disorders. While betahistine can be helpful in reducing symptoms of vertigo, it is important to also address any underlying causes of these symptoms and to adopt lifestyle changes that may help to improve balance and reduce the risk of vertigo episodes.\n\nExercises that involve the neck and arms can be a useful addition to treatment for vertigo, as they can help to improve strength and flexibility in these areas, which can in turn help to improve balance and reduce the risk of falls. Some examples of neck and arm exercises that may be helpful include:\n\nNeck stretches: Gently tilt your head to the left, right, forward, and back, holding each position for a few seconds. Repeat this sequence several times.\n\nShoulder rolls: Roll your shoulders backwards and forwards, focusing on keeping your neck relaxed and straight.\n\nArm raises: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your arms by your sides. Slowly lift your arms out to the sides, keeping them straight and parallel to the ground. Hold for a few seconds, then lower your arms back down.\n\nTricep dips: Place your hands on a stable surface, such as the edge of a chair or bench, and straighten your arms. Slowly bend your elbows to lower your body down, then straighten your arms to push back up.\n\nIt's important to start slowly and gradually increase the intensity and duration of these exercises as your strength and flexibility improve. It may also be helpful to consult with a physical therapist or other healthcare professional to develop a personalized exercise plan that is appropriate for your needs and abilities."}, {"label": 0, "content": "Thanks for your question on Health Care Magic.

I read your query, and from what information you have given me, it appears that your son has short constitutional stature and not growth hormone deficiency. Well, but it depends on many factors such as the mid-parental height, ethnicity, nutritional status, etc. Since he is below the third percentile for age for boys for height, I would suggest a proper work-up to rule out hormonal deficiencies such as, 1. Thyroid function test. 2. IGF-1 (insluin-growth fractor) and IGFBP-3 (insulin-like growth fractor binding protein). 3. LH (leutinizing hormone) and FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) routine tests like CBC (complete blood count), ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation arte). 4. Liver function test. 5. Renal function test.6. Urinalysis, and X-ray of left hand and wrist. If the hormone analysis comes out abnormal or in other words, there is a deficiency of any of the above hormones, and then I would suggest MRI pituitary gland. Because short constitutional stature is not a disorder but a variation in normal growth, therefore, medical treatment is not usually necessary.So I would not suggest any hormonal treatment as it will not benefit him at this age as his bones have matured by now.

According to American heart association, normal healthy heart rate is 60-100 beats per minute when you are relaxed and not engaged in a physical activity. If your heart rate is 100 bpm or above while you are resting and relaxed it is called as tachycardia. However, If you engage in any physical activity your heart rate can race up. That is normal.  Subtracting your age from 220 you can find out your maximum heart rate. For instance, If you are 50 years old, your maximum heart rate is 220-50= 170 bpm. Anyway in your condition, I would recommend that you consult your family doctor for a physical examination and proper consultation. I am sure your family doctor will direct you to a  normal ECG test and stress ECG or exercise ECG test to rule out some pathologies appearing during physical activities. Also he or she may direct you to a holter monitor test if necessary to rule out some arrhythmias.  Conditions like atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter can cause very high pulse rate like yours and sometimes for that cause is hyperthyroidism. Therefore, you might need to check your thyroid function too.               Concerning your blood in stool, I think it might be as a result of gastrointestinal pathology and I hardly believe it is  related to your high pulse rate.Also I want to ask you the color of blood you noticed on your stool. Red color fresh blood on stool can be due to hemorrhoids or due to hard stool passage  while black stool can be as a result of hemorrhage due to ulcer disease, ulcerative colitis etc.  In order to diagnose these conditions, again you have to do a stool test and explain all other symptoms you have. You may need to undergo an endoscopy if your physician wants to rule out above mentioned diseases.  I think your blood in stool may be related to a gastrointestinal pathology.Therefore, I will highly recommend that you consult your family doctor for proper consultation,diagnosis and treatment.

I will do my best to help you. The prevention of kidney stone is a complex subject and there is loads of good information on this on the Internet. I would recommend the Mayo Clinic's web site as an excellent place to start. Also, you need to discuss this with you own doctor or urologist. First of all it depends on what type of stone is developing in your kidney or bladder. This has to be determined. If you can, develop the habit of urinating through a sieve just in case you can catch a small stone for your doctor to send for analysis. Most stones are calcium based. Dietary restrictions in calcium is however no longer recommended. This is because it does not seem to work and, in any case, calcium is an important mineral for proper bodily functioning. Some stones are composed of uric acid in which case allopurinol, to lower uric acid levels, may be prescribed. All recurrence rate of all stones can be reduced by increasing daily fluid intake. The cheapest way to achieve this is by drinking lots of water. The aim should be to increase fluid intake to the point where you are passing at least four pints of urine every day.

Corns are a common problem for diabetics, as diabetes can cause changes in the skin and circulation that make the feet more prone to developing these types of lesions. Here are some steps you can take to help prevent corn development:\n\nKeep your blood sugar levels under control: Maintaining good blood sugar control is important for preventing many complications of diabetes, including foot problems.\n\nWear proper footwear: Wearing shoes that fit properly and provide enough cushioning can help protect your feet from the friction and pressure that can cause corns. Avoid shoes with pointed or narrow toes or high heels, as these can put extra pressure on your toes.\n\nUse padding or cushioning: To help reduce pressure on areas of your feet prone to developing corns, you can try using pads or cushions made specifically for this purpose. These can be placed over the corn or in the shoe to help reduce friction and pressure.\n\nMoisturize your feet: Dry skin is more prone to cracking and developing corns, so it's important to keep your feet moisturized. Use a cream or lotion specifically formulated for the feet, and apply it daily to help prevent dryness.\n\nCheck your feet daily: Inspect your feet regularly for any changes or signs of problems, such as redness, swelling, or blisters. If you notice any changes, be sure to speak with your healthcare provider.\n\nVisit a chiropodist or podiatrist: If you have a corn that is causing you pain or discomfort, it's important to see a healthcare professional for treatment. A chiropodist or podiatrist can remove the corn and help you manage any other foot issues you may have.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful. It's important for people with diabetes to take extra care of their feet, as foot problems can lead to more serious complications if left untreated.

If you have had unprotected sex on multiple occasions and are concerned about the possibility of pregnancy, it is important to speak with a healthcare provider as soon as possible. They can help you determine the best course of action for your situation.\n\nIt's worth noting that there are other, more reliable methods of birth control that can be used to prevent pregnancy. These include:\n\nOral contraceptives (the \"pill\"): These are pills that contain hormones that prevent pregnancy. They are taken daily and are available in different forms, including combination pills (which contain both estrogen and progestin) and progestin-only pills. Oral contraceptives are effective at preventing pregnancy when taken correctly, but they are not foolproof and can fail if you miss a dose or vomit after taking them.\n\nIntrauterine devices (IUDs): These are small, T-shaped devices that are inserted into the uterus to prevent pregnancy. There are two types of IUDs: copper and hormonal. Copper IUDs work by releasing small amounts of copper into the uterus to kill or damage sperm, while hormonal IUDs release a low dose of progestin to thicken cervical mucus and thin the lining of the uterus. IUDs are highly effective at preventing pregnancy and can be left in place for several years.\n\nBarrier methods: These are physical barriers that prevent sperm from reaching the egg. Examples include male condoms, female condoms, diaphragms, and cervical caps. Barrier methods are effective at preventing pregnancy when used correctly, but they do not provide as much protection as other methods.\n\nIt's important to choose a birth control method that is right for you and to use it consistently and correctly to reduce the risk of unintended pregnancy. If you have any questions or concerns about your options, it is a good idea to speak with a healthcare provider or a reproductive health professional.

Elevated levels of D-dimer can be a sign of a blood clot, but a negative D-dimer test does not necessarily rule out the possibility of a PE.\n\nThere are other conditions that can cause symptoms similar to those of a PE, such as heart failure, pneumonia, and asthma.

Ovulation is the process of the release of an egg from the ovary, and it is necessary for pregnancy to occur.\n\nThere are several ways you can track your menstrual cycle and try to predict when you are ovulating:\n\nKeep a menstrual calendar: This involves tracking the length of your menstrual cycle and the dates of your periods. The length of a menstrual cycle is typically 28 days, but it can range from 21 to 35 days. Ovulation typically occurs around day 14 of a 28-day cycle, but this can vary based on the length of your cycle.\n\nUse ovulation predictor kits: These kits are available at pharmacies and can help you predict when you are ovulating by detecting the presence of luteinizing hormone (LH) in your urine. LH surges just before ovulation and can be detected with an ovulation predictor kit.\n\nTrack your basal body temperature: Your basal body temperature is your body's temperature at rest. It tends to rise slightly after ovulation. By taking your temperature every morning before you get out of bed and tracking it over time, you may be able to identify patterns and predict when you are most likely to ovulate.\n\nIt is also important to talk to your doctor about any concerns you have about your menstrual cycle and fertility. Your doctor may be able to suggest treatments or medications that can help regulate your menstrual cycle and increase your chances of getting pregnant. For example, the medication Fertyl (clomiphene) is often used to treat infertility in women with irregular periods.

Reducing general health. Mother nature has arranged our body functioning in such a way that whenever there is any risk to life, the reproductory function is jeopardized first. However, Tuberculosis is such commonly wide spread disease in India and still the population is increasing. By and large, Pulmonary tuberculosis in early stage does not affect fertility. 2. By affecting the Reproductory Organs: When there is Genital tuberculosis, the tubes and uterine lining (endometrium) get affected. Affected endometrium is not conducive for implantation of the fertilized ovum and hence pregnancy is not possible. When the tubes get affected, there is tubal block. Along with the tubal block, tubal musculature also gets affected causing dysfunction in the tubal motility. Therefore, even after the surgical correction of the tubal block, if the tubal peristaltic movements are affected, conception is not possible. This is called as Functional Tubal Block; i.e. physically patent still functionally blocked tubes. You are suffering from Tubercular ascites. There is a good chance that due to ascetic fluid and peritoneal tubercular infection, the tubes and uterus also may be affected. Even, affection of the ovaries will affect the egg release function of the ovaries.Once your anti-tubercular treatment is over and you are declared completely cured of the tuberculosis, you should undergo some investigations like Hysterosalpingography (X-ray of uterus and tubes with radio-opaque dye in it) and/or Laparoscopy to assess the status of endometrium and tubes. Ultrasonography also will be of use for the purpose. These investigations only will inform us whether your reproductory organs are in a state to offer you any successful pregnancy. Madam, your first aim should be to get cured from Tuberculosis. Once you are cured, get investigated for fertility potential. Even if you are unable to conceive, you can adopt a child - this will give you a desired child, the child will get parents and still the population will not be increased.

Post nasal drip is a condition in which mucus from the sinuses drains down the back of the throat, often causing irritation and inflammation. This can lead to a sore palate, as well as other symptoms such as a sore throat, cough, and congestion.\n\nPseudoephedrine is a medication that can help to alleviate symptoms of post nasal drip by narrowing the blood vessels in the nasal passages and reducing inflammation. It is often used in combination with other medications to relieve symptoms of sinusitis, allergies, and the common cold. However, it is important to note that pseudoephedrine can have side effects and may not be suitable for everyone.

In this case, it's important to make sure that she is getting enough fluids to prevent dehydration, as diarrhea can cause fluid loss.
