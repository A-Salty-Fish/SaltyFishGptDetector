The fateful run occurred at the end of a tournament day, after Montgomery had almost unhorsed the king.  Henry instead on another tilt.  Montgomery's lance struck the king's helmet and shattered, with a long splinter running through the king's visor through his eye and into or near his brain.  The king initially survived injury, and was attended to by two of the most celebrated physicians in Europe, Ambroise Par\u00e9 and Andreas Vesalius.  The queen, Catherine de Medici, ordered four prisoners executed with wood driven into their brains so that the physicians would have the chance to study the king's wound in detail on the corpses.  Despite this rather extraordinary measure, the king deteriorated steadily.  Vesalius' personal account is consistent with the development of meningitis or encephalitis.  After 11 days, the king died.During these 11 days, Montgomery is supposed to have come to the king's side, and asked to have his head and right hand cut off in punishment.  The king told him that he had jousted well and bravely and that the accident was not his fault.Following Henry's death, Catherine essentially ruled through a series of three of her sons.  Montgomery retired to his estate in Normandy.  From there, his history gets a bit complicated.  He converted to Protestantism and took part in the religious fighting in Bourges and Rouen that followed the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in 1572.  He escaped to England and remained there for about a year, later returning to attempt to lead a Huguenot insurrection in Normandy.  He was captured by royal forces and executed in 1574.Sourced, in part, \"The Death of Henry II of France\" Journal of Neurosurgery 12/1992", "label": 0}, {"content": "Henry II of England was a king of England from 1509 to 1547 and from 1553 to 1558.

Livingston (the R. also stood for Robert, oddly enough) were sent to Paris not to buy the enormous swath of land subsequently called the Louisiana Purchase but to negotiate the purchase of New Orleans and the Mississippi Delta, thereby securing the lucrative Mississippi River shipping route. Negotiations fell through, and it wasn't until Livingston returned in 1803 that Napoleon was so hard-up on cash due to the continent-wide war of conquest he was waging that he was willing to make a deal with the Americans. At the time, Livingston was authorized by Jefferson to spend up to $9 million in order to purchase New Orleans and the rights to the Mississippi. Since the US was planning on making a significant purchase from France, the delegation (Monroe rejoined Livingston in Paris shortly thereafter) travelled to Paris with $3 million in gold. In 1803,[gold was worth just under $20 an ounce](_URL_0_), which means they were travelling with almost 10,000 lbs of gold. This wasn't even remotely close to the carrying capacity of freighters of the time. [\"Tea Clipper\" Frigates of that time could carry twenty times that weight.](_URL_1_).Now, the negotiations took a turn when Napoleon decided he needed more money and offered the whole Louisiana Purchase for $15 million. Livingston and Monroe were authorized by Jefferson to spend up to 9 million on New Orleans and the rights to the Mississippi, so when given this offer, they had to make a decision without the President's approval, and just couldn't pass up the deal. Oddly enough, I just read the chapter describing the negotiations in Stephen Clarke's very entertaining *1000 Years of Annoying the French*.  According to Clarke, the purchase was paid for with the above-mentioned 3 million in gold as a down payment, with the cancelling of 3.75 million in debt that France owed to the US for French piracy on American ships since the revolution, and the rest was issued in bonds. Again from Clarke: > French Banks were too nervous to accept the bonds, and two foreign banks had to step in to provide the cash. The first was Hope and Company,  a bank based in Amsterdam but set up by Scotsmen. The second was a London bank, Barings. Napoleon was in such dire straits that he agreed to sell the bonds to the banks at a 12.5% discount.

So how about men? Well, we *also* have attestation for that, from multiple sources. The more entertaining one is gonna be Martial *Epigrammata* IX, 27: (quick translation):  >  You have epilated testicles, Chrestus, and a cock that's like a vulture's neck, and a head smoother than a prostitute's ass, and there is not a single hair on your thighs, and merciless tweezers groom your bloodless lips. And you only talk about Curius, Camillus, Quintius, Numa, Ancus, and every sort of hairy thing that we might read about, and you are loud and threatening with grand words, and you argue with the theatres and with the present time. If some other butt-boy (sodomite) should come along, now that he's free from his teacher, and whose throbbing cock has been unleashed by the artisan, you, calling him with a nod, lead him off; and Chrestus, it shames me to say what you do with your Catonian tongue.^1...*ahem*. Filthy Latin poetry aside, you get the idea. In slightly...tamer Latin, Suetonius gives lascivious accounts of Julius Caesar (of stabbity fame), giving a very specific nod to his....wanton ways: >  He was somewhat overnice in the care of his person, being not only carefully trimmed and shaved, but even having superfluous hair plucked out, as some have charged; while his baldness was a disfigurement which troubled him greatly, since he found that it was often the subject of the gibes of his detractors. Because of it he used to comb forward his scanty locks from the crown of his head, and of all the honours voted him by the senate and people there was none which he received or made use of more gladly than the privilege of wearing a laurel wreath at all times. They say, too, that he was remarkable in his dress; that he wore a senator's tunic with fringed sleeves reaching to the wrist, and always had a girdle over it, though rather a loose one; and this, they say, was the occasion of Sulla's mot, when he often warned the nobles to keep an eye on the ill-girt boy.Finally, the job of \"hair plucker\" was a literal job. Seneca mentions depilation a few times in his *Moral Epistles*. First off, in his letter that's best summed up as \"don't treat your slaves like shit. They're people too.\" >  Another, who serves the wine, must dress like a woman and wrestle with his advancing years; he cannot get away from his boyhood; he is dragged back to it; and though he has already acquired a soldier\u2019s figure, he is kept beardless by having his hair smoothed away or plucked out by the roots, and he must remain awake throughout the night, dividing his time between his master\u2019s drunkenness and his lust; in the chamber he must be a man, at the feast a boy.(A small reminder, Roman slavery was horrible. The above example is a small sample size of many, many horrors. Sen. *Epistulae*. 47.)Then, in a slightly less grim context... (describing the noises that disturb the person who rents out an apartment above a bath - *Ep.* 57): >  Then, perhaps, a professional a comes along, shouting out the score; that is the finishing touch. Add to this the arresting of an occasional roysterer or pickpocket, the racket of the man who always likes to hear his own voice in the bathroom, or the enthusiast who plunges into the swimming-tank with unconscionable noise and splashing. **Besides all those whose voices, if nothing else, are good, imagine the hair-plucker with his penetrating, shrill voice,\u2014for purposes of advertisement,\u2014continually giving it vent and never holding his tongue except when he is plucking the armpits and making his victim yell instead.** Then the cake-seller with his varied cries, the sausageman, the confectioner, and all the vendors of food hawking their wares, each with his own distinctive intonation.So yeah, the Romans plucked, pruned, shaved, groomed, and did what they thought looked pretty. Grouchier conservative voices would squawk about how gay it was, and the youth would wholeheartedly agree, making gay jokes at each other while getting their armpits plucked.

It helps to think of the scandal not as a single 'event' but rather as a storm of linked occurrences that eventually reached a boiling point.  As you are probably aware, the Watergate scandal had its genesis when a group of individuals were caught illegally breaking into the Watergate complex, which at the time was the Democratic Party's national headquarters.  The exact purpose of the break-in has remained surprisingly nebulous, but generally it is assumed that the objective was to obtain political intelligence for use in the upcoming 1972 election. Jeb Magruder, who was deputy director at the Committee for the Re-election of the President and one of the main figures involved in the scandal, said in an interview that they wanted to get Larry O'Brien's (who was chairman of the DNC at the time) opposition research on Republicans. The reason why this scandal was so catastrophic to Nixon, his senior aides, and his administration was largely because of the coverup that followed that also caused the revelation of the other 'horrors' that had occurred within the Nixon White House. For what it's worth, the generally accepted history is that Nixon was not aware beforehand and had certainly not ordered the Watergate break in itself. Eventually, the money trail of the Watergate burglars led to the Committee to Reelect the President (sometimes ironically referred to as CREEP), which was linked to key figures of the Nixon Administration like John Mitchell who had served as Attorney General. CRP was involved in many legally questionable activities such as money laundering, maintaining slush funds, and many of its members eventually committed perjury when questioned about its activities. To cut a very long story short (and skipping over some intermediate steps of this scandal), it eventually became known that Nixon maintained a taping system in the Oval Office, at his study in Camp David, and at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. The existence of this taping system was revealed by Alexander Butterfield during his Senate testimony. These tapes were immediately subpoenaed but Nixon refused to comply by citing executive privilege. Subsequently, after the special prosecutor Archibald Cox refused to compromise with Nixon over the tapes, Nixon ordered the Attorney General Elliot Richardson to fire Cox. He refused to do this and instead resigned. Then, Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus was ordered to fire Cox. He also refused, so Nixon fired him. The next in line was Robert Bork, who did eventually fire Cox. This event is known as the Saturday Night Massacre. Despite Nixon's best efforts, after the unanimous United States V. Nixon Supreme Court decision, he was eventually forced to hand over the raw tapes of his conversations. These tapes revealed a vindictive, petty, and rude President that contrasted strongly with his public image.One of these tapes is the 'smoking gun tape'. This conversation caused his political support to completely evaporate. You can listen to this tape [here.](_URL_0_) Essentially, Nixon agrees with Haldeman's plan of using the CIA to stop the FBI's investigation into the Watergate break-in under the guise of 'national security', a clear obstruction of justice. Furthermore, other tapes reveal more disturbing information of the coverup, such as Nixon's endorsement of 'hush money' to participants of the Watergate burglary. Also, other abuses of power such as using the IRS to audit Nixon's political enemies were also uncovered.Facing certain impeachment on at least one count of obstruction of justice, Nixon resigned on August 9th 1974. Dozens of Nixon's top officials were found guilty of perjury, obstruction of justice, and conspiracy and subsequently many had to serve lengthy prison sentences. Nixon himself, of course, was spared such a fate by virtue of Gerald Ford granting him an absolute pardon. This post is already rather lengthy, so I will stop here. But there are many layers to the scandal that I haven't touched on explicitly (such as the role of John Dean, the efforts of E. Howard Hunt to 'blackmail' the White House, Pat Gray's destruction of evidence, the role of 'Deep Throat', etc.)It's truly difficult to succinctly tell you just how deep the malfeasance ran during Nixon's presidency. So many shady and unethical things were done by people who were extremely close to Nixon.  Here is just one example: [this tape](_URL_1_) is a conversation between Nixon and John Ehrlichman, who served as Nixon's top domestic policy advisor. This conversation is **fascinating** (I have time stamped the URL at the most pertinent point). Nixon asks Ehrlichman if he had ever heard of a fake letter from JFK to President Diem. Ehrlichman not only says that he is aware of it but that Charles Colson (one of the President's *closest* advisors) was the driving force behind this fabricated cable. Nixon is astonished. I think this tape helps to show just how deeply the unethical behaviour festered in the White House. The President's closest associates were involved in blatantly illegal and immoral activities. We can only wonder what happened in the 18 and a half minute section of the tapes that was suspiciously erased.For further reading, I would recommend books that go into detail of the Nixon tapes.

If soldiers were able to identify a particularly important individual, there would probably have been a mad scramble to capture him rather than kill him outright, both for political purposes and for the potential for ransom profits. This happened to the French king Jean II at Poitiers, who was taken prisoner in a furious melee where other high-ranking French aristocrats, who ordinarily would have made excellent ransoms, were killed (possibly by accident as English troops swarmed to grab Jean specifically). When kings were killed outright in combat, it does not seem to have been a particular mark of controversy. John the Blind, King of Bohemia, died at Crecy but his killer was not specifically identified in accounts of the battle and the story of his death is conveyed merely as an illustration of John's bravery and valiant nature. Kings who fought did so in the full knowledge that they were at risk of being killed or captured at the battlefield.English military contracts from the Hundred Years War suggest that there was no stigma attached to a common soldier capturing important aristocrats; they often contained clauses saying that any particular important prisoners (like a prince or something) would be handed over to the king in exchange for a cash payment. This worked to both parties'  advantage: common soldiers would probably not be be financially able to house and feed a prisoner (especially a royal prisoner) during the period in which the ransom was negotiated and paid. If there was any limitation on killing aristocrats, it would be that troops wanted to maximize their profit by taking nobles alive for ransom. This is most apparent in the hesitation of some English troops to kill their prisoners at the Battle of Agincourt. This incident is often taken as some kind of commentary on class relations, but in reality is just a reflection of soldiers looking out for their bottom line.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The common soldier was not allowed to kill a King.

There are several examples of its effectiveness, particularly in the many battles where European forces expanded or consolidated their empires.In the 1870s and 1880s the British used the gatling gun against African tribes armed primarily with spears in the Anglo-Zulu and Anglo-Ashanti wars (specifically the 3rd Anglo-Ashanti war in this case) and against forces with firearms and canons in the Anglo-Egyptian war (1882). In the battle of Tel-el-kabir (Anglo-Egyptian war) for example, the British managed a 50:1 ratio in Egyptian dead vs. their dead (2000 to 39), partially due to the use of gatling guns. In the Battle of Ulundi (Anglo-Zulu war, 1879) the British were outnumbered nearly 3:1 but through the use of two gatling guns and canons firing cannister shot were able to win the battle with a huge mismatch in fatalities (fewer than 20 killed on the British side, nearly 500 dead on the Zulu side).In a particularly noteworthy example there is the Battle of San Juan Hill during the Spanish-American War (1898). While assaulting Kettle Hill 3 gatling guns were employed to provide continuous suppressive fire against the Spanish, allowing American forces to advance up the hill in what would have otherwise been suicidal conditions. In a period of about 8 and a half minutes three guns expended about 18,000 rounds, indicating the gatlings were in near continuous use during that period of time. After the Americans had taken the hill and while the gatling guns were being repositioned to the top of San Juan ridge a hasty counter-attack by about 600 Spanish soldiers was cut down with fire from just a single gatling, killing nearly the entirety of the force in a matter of minutes.There are many other contemporary examples. Suffice it to say that the gatling gun was quite effective under the right conditions and effectively destroyed the potential for massed frontal assaults (even with favorable numbers of soldiers). That doesn't mean it was an unstoppable devastating force in all cases, it had its limitations just as any weapon does, but it was quite devastating in the few specific cases where it could shine (open ground, large numbers of close packed enemy troops).The impact it had on warfare was to make frontal charges much less effective. It and its successors (the Maxim gun and other fully automatic machine guns) drove warfare increasingly toward the WWI model: trenches and fortifications across a front-line that was in most cases suicide to attempt to cross, even en masse. And that eventually led to modern combined arms tactics, the employment of artillery, small arms, light machine guns, grenades, mortars, mobile armor (tanks, APCs, AFVs, etc.), and even aircraft in a carefully coordinated assault. And, incidentally, the demise of cavalry (though artillery is also a significant contributing factor there).", "label": 0}, {"content": "The gattling gun was a machine gun that was invented in 1868 by John Browning.

It wasn't so much Hitler as much as it was Hitler's commanders. In particular, it was Gerd von Rundstedt, commander of the German Army Group A, that made the decision. You see, at the start of WW2, Hitler did not micromanage his military as much, leaving quite a bit of the decisions to the discretion of his commanders. To understand Dunkirk, we must go first to the opening stages of the Battle of France. When Germany invaded, the French had a long line of fortifications (the Maginot Line) facing the German border. The French expected that the Maginot Line would force the Germans to attack France through Belgium. This was exactly what happened, but Belgium can be roughly divided into two regions: the lowlands, and a heavily-forested stretch known as the Ardennes. The French knew that the Germans were good at tank warfare, and since the Ardennes was poor tank country, they thought the main attack would come through the lowlands. The Ardennes was also very rugged, and the French believed it would take the Germans at least a week to get through. Since the French expected that the majority of the German forces could be committed to the lowlands, that is where they sent their elite forces. Some forces were assigned to defend the Ardennes approach, but they were basically the weaker, poorer-trained parts of the French military. So, what the Germans did, was that they took a big gamble and it paid off. They committed much of their best forces to the Ardennes approach while launching a simultaneous phoney attack at the lowland approach. This deceived the Allied forces (French, British, and Belgian) into believing they were in the right place, while the elite German forces swept aside the weaker part of the French as well as Belgian forces and broke through into France. Their motorized, armoured divisions leading the charge, the Germans had made it past the Ardennes in two days rather than a week. By 19 May, 1940, the Germans had destroyed the French forces (primarily the French Ninth Army) guarding the Meuse River that faced the Ardennes approach. The best of the French forces and their British allies, who had hitherto been preoccupied fighting off phoney attacks, were now cut off from the rest of France. By May 21, the Allies realized they were basically surrounded by the enemy and stuck in Belgium. German forces were quickly moving to encircle the Allies. The French forces stuck in the north were ordered to fight their way south, to reunite with the rest of the French military. The British on the other hand, were not operating on entirely the same orders as the French, and poor communication between the Allies even led to friendly fire. The British did, however, participate in the planned French counterattack against the Germans to break out. This was called the Battle of Arras, and it was a failure. Although Allied forces made early gains, the Germans (particularly Rommel's division) quickly organized a defensive response. Bad communication between the Allies made them slow to take advantage of potential opportunities, and the Allies suffered heavily. What the Battle of Arras did do, however, was put a scare into the German commanders. During the Battle of Arras, the Germans realized that the speed of their advance meant that some tank divisions had outrun the infantry divisions, leaving tanks without infantry support and vice versa. German commanders worried about being outflanked. Although Rommel successfully held his ground, he made alarmist claims that he had been attacked by hundreds of British tanks (when the reality was 88 tanks, more or less), and was in favor of sitting tight until the infantry divisions caught up. The Germans basically felt like they had overextended themselves, and despite beating back the Arras counterattack, they feared they might not be able to fend off a second counterattack (unaware of the dire straits of the Allies post-Arras). In light of these considerations, the leading commander of the German forces in the area, Gerd von Rundstedt, called for a halt in the German advance. Rundstedt estimated the infantry needed 36 hours to catch up, when in reality it took 48 hours before the German advance could resume. This brief period of respite allowed the British to rally themselves after the chaos at Arras, and they retreated to the English Channel, to the beaches of Dunkirk, where the evacuation of 400,000 British soldiers trapped there would begin. After the Germans regrouped, they did exactly as you said, and tried to crush the British army stranded in Dunkirk while they had them cut off and surrounded. Only this wasn't as easy as it sounded. Remember, there was still a French component stuck on the wrong side of France with the British, and they fought valiantly in the face of near-certain defeat with desperate rearguard actions. Also, you must factor in the British Royal Air Force and the British Royal Navy's contributions. The RAF in particular flew over 3,500 sorties, using 16 squadrons, and met the Luftwaffe in fierce dogfights that exacted a heavy toll on the German bombers. Because the RAF's dogfights took place far from the beaches (if the Luftwaffe reached the beaches it was already too late, they had broken past the RAF), much of the Army was unaware of the RAF's brave attempts to protect them. Many soldiers thus bitterly complained about the RAF doing nothing to help, painfully unaware of the pilots fighting and dying in the skies far away from them until they had safely returned home. In essence, all this manage to delay the Germans long enough for the British to escape. Keep in mind that while the German halt order after Arras may have bought valuable time for the British to evacuate from Dunkirk, the Germans were probably in need of a halt order anyway. Their armored divisions were way ahead of their supporting infantry, and they had been fighting all the way from the Ardennes; they were in dire need of repair and refueling. TL;DR version, Hitler/the Germans did not crush the British army while he had it surrounded and cut off at Dunkirk, because in the sheer impetus of the blitzkrieg into France, his infantry hadn't caught up to his tanks/armour, and the tanks/armour needed rest, repair, and refueling. The Germans then got hit with a counterattack by Allied forces trying to break out of the German encirclement, got scared, and decided to halt and catch their breath. Once they were regrouped and recovered, the Germans did their best to crush the British at Dunkirk, but ultimately failed due to the valiant yet doomed French forces fighting a rearguard action and the bravery of both the British Navy and the Air Force coming to the rescue of the trapped Army.Hope this helped!Sources:- Horne, A.

Since Greek heavy infantry went into battle carrying a large round shield in front of him, it has long been assumed that the only effective way to hurt an opponent was to go for the thighs (below the shield) or the throat (above the shield). However, Christopher Matthew has recently done a lot of work comparing combat depictions, actual remains of ancient armour, and \"experimental archaeology\" (testing out replicas), and his conclusion is that the notion of a throat \"kill shot\" is probably a myth. Excavated armour that shows combat damage has usually been struck in an upward direction, suggesting straightforward underarm thrusting rather than overhand \"poking\" over the rim of the enemy's shield. The most common targets for spear thrusts of this kind were the enemy's centre mass - his chest, straight through the shield - and the head that poked out over the shield. However this may be, it is a fact that the meat and two veg were essentially unprotected by even the heaviest Greek hoplite panoply. Only a few strips of hardened linen served to deflect blows to the hoplite's other spear. A warrior could do no more than use his shield and his distance from the enemy to keep his manhood safe. Therefore, whether by overhand or underarm thrusting, blows aimed at a man's junk may well have been common; it was a \"soft target\" in more ways than one.Amazingly, we actually have an ancient reference to a man struck in the nethers and bleeding to death from the resulting wound. The 7th century BC Spartan poet Tyrtaios wrote these immortal lines: >  An aging warrior cut down in the vanguard of battle >  disgraces the young.

More particularly, it depends on why your teacher has decided to frame the Second World War in this way.I\u2019m coming at this from a perspective of someone who studies (and teaches) a conflict whose relationship to the Second World War is quite debatable. A classic exam-style question for college students who study modern European history is \u2018Was the Spanish Civil War the opening phase of the Second World War?\u2019. It\u2019s asked not because there is a right or wrong answer, but because it depends entirely on how you define the crucial issues at stake, and you can make a valid argument either way. For instance, if the Second World War is defined as an anti-fascist war, then it makes sense to view Spain as the beginning of this wider conflict; the opening blows in a wider ideological war. But if the Second World War is about something else \u2013 not least because the war in Asia and the Pacific doesn\u2019t map neatly into a fascist/anti-fascist divide \u2013 then it no longer makes sense to view Spain as part of the same conflict. Your exam answer depends entirely on the frame of reference you want to adopt.In this case, I can think of several reasons why someone might want to frame the conflict in the ways that your teacher wanted to. For instance, in terms of simple arithmetic, these are the theatres that saw the highest numbers of deaths. For both Germany and Japan, I believe there\u2019s a case to be made that these were considered the most important fronts to achieve their aims, and generally saw the largest allocation of resources, though I\u2019d gladly defer to an expert on either war effort on the extent this held true over time. Equally, there are reasons why it\u2019s spurious \u2013 the influence of the United States, especially in terms of industrial production, was far too large to entirely discount in this way. The territory and populations that were won and lost in the \u2018comparatively small\u2019 conflicts were massive by any reasonable standard, and those that suffered occupation, displacement, exploitation and extermination could justifiably challenge any version of the conflict that so blithely downplayed their experiences.But more importantly, I think, there\u2019s a pedagogical case to be made for radically reframing the conflict for students. I don\u2019t think any conflict has been the subject of national myth-making to the extent that the Second World War has, from the Battle of Britain, to Omaha Beach, to the French Resistance and more. There is a tendency to emphasise certain national perspectives, which in turn often leads to distorted impressions of how the war was won or lost. Challenging students\u2019 understanding of what was important about the Second World War, going beyond the frame of reference that is provided in popular culture and high school history, is a useful way of showing students that things can look very different from perspectives other than the ones we grew up with. In other words, showing that studying history is not just about memorising dates and events, but being critical and flexible in how we approach the past.Tl;dr: if your professor has presented this view as divine truth, then there are many reasons to question it. But if, as seems more likely, they are challenging you to rethink the way you\u2019ve framed the Second World War up until now, then they're just doing their job.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The professor was correct in stating that the two major wars were between Russia and Germany and Japan and China.

For hundreds of years, however, the few Europeans dating documents preferred to continue the traditional system of dating by regnal year. By the high Middle Ages, chroniclers like Herman of Reichanau are numbering their entries by A.D. year, but we're still not quite at the point where they're common usage in charters or in people's minds. (Court testimony from even the late Middle Ages sometimes has people figure dates from either kings' regnal year or with reference to more local events). Just to make things even more interesting, Hebrew calendar years are *also* a creation of the High Middle Ages.And yet, in these 4-5 centuries of only scattershot use of the A.D. system, there are isolated instances of writers who *do* pick it up and run with it. Bede in 7th-8th century England is perhaps the most famous. How did they do it? Easter!The Christian liturgical calendar(s) involves some feasts that are fixed to a date and others that are more fluid. Most importantly and controversially, Easter, the history (and present, see: Catholic versus Orthodox) of whose dating is a giant mess. The early Church decided on a date for Easter that *relates to* the vernal equinox. But here's the thing. As you know, and as ancient people knew, years are not actually 365 days. Hence the introduction of leap years. And the presence of leap years (in the Julian calendar, which has too many leap years and so would be a problem by the sixteenth century) combined with the decision that Easter must always be a Sunday meant that the date of Easter had to be *calculated*. Indeed, this *computus* was a crucial duty of the early medieval clergy. They made table after table that calculated and listed the dates of Easter for centuries to come. So even across centuries of sporadic *functional* use of AD/CE, the medieval Church placed an absolutely premium on keeping track of the advancement of years in terms fixed to the date once presumed to be either the conception or birth of Christ.There are some conspiracy theories floating around about \"phantom time\" that jump off from just that lack of consistent *functional* use of AD dating in Western Christian sources. These fall apart on a couple of grounds. First, the Hijri or Islamic calendar was in use from the mid-7th century, and we can compare its advancement of years to the European. Should one posit a *transnational* conspiracy to erase or add centuries, let the stars be your guide. It is possible to date significant astronomical events, such as things retro-identified as comets with known visiting patterns or eclipses.

Mariconda notes in \"The Emergence of Cthulhu\" (*Lovecraft Studies* #15, 1987), that on the same day Lovecraft hatched the plot, he had been reading Lord Dunsany - which will be important later.From this basic idea H. P. Lovecraft outlined [\"The Call of Cthulhu\"](_URL_5_) April 12-13, 1925, and actually wrote the story a year later in August or September 1926 (S. T. Joshi, *I Am Providence* 2.600-601, 636-638).There were several significant influences on \"The Call of Cthulhu\" - the plot element of creating the bas-relief in dreams is evident from Guy de Maupassant's [\"The Horla\"](_URL_0_) (1887); Theosophy, with its cosmic cycles and strange entities that came down to the stars: >  Old Castro remembered bits of hideous legend that paled the speculations of theosophists and made man and the world seem recent and transient indeed. There had been aeons when other Things ruled on the earth, and They had had great cities....and A. Merritt's [The Moon Pool](_URL_11_) (1918), which is set in the strange ruins of Nan Matol in Ponape. >  Remains of Them, he said the deathless Chinamen had told him, were still to be found as Cyclopean stones on islands in the Pacific.But the most immediate influence is the artificial mythology of British fantaisiste Lord Dunsany, which began with [The Gods of Peg\u0101na](_URL_9_) (1905); there is actually a specific reference in \"The Call of Cthulhu\" to one of Dunsany's stories: >  The Thing cannot be described\u2014there is no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy, such eldritch contradictions of all matter, force, and cosmic order. A mountain walked or stumbled. God! What wonder that across the earth a great architect went mad, and poor Wilcox raved with fever in that telepathic instant? The Thing of the idols, the green, sticky spawn of the stars, had awaked to claim his own.This is a reference to Act III of Dunsany's [The Gods of the Mountain](): >  MAN You were all green, Master, all green in the gloaming, all of rock again as you used to be in the mountains. Master, we can bear to see you in flesh like men, but when we see rock walking it is terrible, it is terrible. >  AGMAR That is how we appeared to you? >  MAN Yes, Master. Rock should not walk. When children see it they do not understand. Rock should not walk in the evening.The idea of gods sleeping for a time, seeming dead, appears to be taken from Dunsany's [\"A Shop in Go-By Street\"](_URL_7_) from *Tales of Three Hemispheres*: >  At that he moved heavily and slowly in way-worn carpet slippers, panting as he went, to the back part of his shop, and I went with him. This was a dingy lumber-room full of idols: the near end was dingy and dark but at the far end was a blue c\u00e6rulean glow in which stars seemed to be shining and the heads of the idols glowed. \"This,\" said the fat old man in carpet slippers, \"is the heaven of the gods who sleep.\" I asked him what gods slept and he mentioned names that I had never heard as well as names that I knew. \"All those,\" he said, \"that are not worshipped now are asleep.\" >  \"Then does Time not kill the gods?\" I said to him and he answered, \"No. But for three or four thousand years a god is worshipped and for three or four he sleeps. Only Time is wakeful always.\" >  \"But they that teach us of new gods\"\u2014I said to him, \"are they not new?\" >  \"They hear the old ones stirring in their sleep being about to wake, because the dawn is breaking and the priests crow.

A pulpy, tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary wings; but it was the general outline of the whole which made it most shockingly frightful.A number of suggestions have been put forth by fans and Lovecraft scholars over the years; Phillip A Schreffler in *The Lovecraft Companion* suggested Lord Tennyson's [\"The Kraken\"](_URL_10_) (1830); Robert M. Price poo-poo'd the idea in the introduction to *The Cthulhu Cycle* (1996), and suggested the tentacle'd nature of Cthulhu owed something to M. R. Jame's [\"Count Magnus\"](_URL_2_) (1904), and further notes the close similarities between Cthulhu as an aquatic giant in the last part of \"The Call of Cthulhu\" and the depiction of Dagon in Lovecraft's [earlier eponymous tale](_URL_1_).So the *idea* of Cthulhu was percolating in Lovecraft for some time; he borrowed portions of concepts from other writers - artificial mythology, sleeping gods and mountainous size from Dunsany; the alien origin and creepy cults from Theosophy (this is actually made more explicit in the text); the telepathic dream-sendings from Dunsany and de Mausauppant - the octopus/dragon mixture is a little hard to pin down, since Lovecraft never went into specifics about his influences on that in his letters, although he did provide [a sketch](_URL_4_) of the idol. But tentacles were not unfamiliar in weird fiction in the period; in addition to M. R. James' \"Count Magnus\" I would also add Arthur Machen's [\"Novel of the Black Seal\"](_URL_8_) (1895) and the alien invaders from H. G. Wells' [The War of the Worlds](_URL_12_) (1897-1898), both of which Lovecraft had read.After \"The Call of Cthulhu\" was written, Lovecraft developed the idea further, positing Cthulhu as the leader of an extraterrestrial race of \"Cthulhu-spawn\" in [At the Mountains of Madness](_URL_6_) and a Great Priest and cousin to the Old Ones in [The Dunwich Horror](_URL_3_).

This is true in terms of [maternal mortality in childbirth](_URL_4_) (scholars calculate around 1-3% per childbirth, for a lifetime risk perhaps around 10%), in terms of social stigma and legal punishment for an out of wedlock birth, in terms of financial cost (women could sue for child support, but the outcome was...uncertain, and suits could lead to their own exile *with their children*), in terms of emotional cost in case of divorce or widowhood (Italian widows returned to their father's home, but any children were the property of the dead husband's family).I open with this because the focus on women and women's health makes the question not as straightforward as one might hope. First there is the gap between the prescriptive, Latin-based (eventually translated) academic medical tradition and practices \"on the ground.\" Second, there is a [lingering and often hilarious discomfort](_URL_1_) in sources--especially from clerics--about women's sexual practices. Even as they denounce women as seductresses and temptresses, they are too scared to mention sexual practices (masturbation! lesbian sex!) outright lest they be the one to plant the idea in women's fragile, innocent minds. And third, less related to the gender, is the question of *actual* versus *perceived/hoped-for* efficacy of any birth control methods.Whether we look at medical texts, religious instructional literature, or legal records, however, there is no doubt that just as many women longed for children and tried desperately to make that happen, many others sought the opposite.The most basic way to prevent childbirth is obviously not to have sex, barring a certain Blessed Virgin. (I am still hoping to find, someday, a court record of a woman claiming her out-of-wedlock kid was a virgin birth). If the [early medieval penitential rules](_URL_2_) on sex were taken seriously, it would not have left many opportunities for pregnancy, which is not a \"guaranteed\" thing for sure. Buuuut the general nature of later medieval literature and, by the time we start having descriptive rather than prescriptive sources about sex, court records suggest these guidelines were...guidelines at best, and maybe not even that (the penitentials are a tempermental historical source).Still, there were definitely some women, including married ones, who created lives of post-nuptial (and sometimes post-childbirth) chastity. 13th century holy woman Marie d'Oignies and her husband opted for a celibate marriage, and 15th century inventor of autobiography Margery Kempe and her husband at least tried for it. (The confused chronology of Kempe's *Book* makes it unclear whether they succeeded completely). Also, total celibacy For All Time was not necessary. Although noble women (and sometimes men) tended to marry young--[NOT a blanket rule for the Middle Ages] (_URL_0_)--women's age at first childbirth was frequently in the 18-20 range rather than the 13-14 one might fear.Medical texts and court records make it clear that herbs, spices, and liquid remedies, the medicines of the Middle Ages, were a major choice when it came to birth control, Plan B, and outright abortifacients. The typical language in the sources is \"to provoke menstruation\" or \"to resume menses,\" but occasionally an author will be more explicit. John Riddle has done fascinating work cataloguing lists of birth control/abortion herbs referenced in ancient and medieval sources, including tracing ideas from Arabic medical literature that ends up in the Latin canon. His two big points are (1) that some of the herb combinations could possibly have had somewhat of an impact and (2) the Middle Ages, as zealously Christian as their writers could be--all university-trained physicians were at least minor clerics--were not always prudish or reticient or SIN SIN SIN about herbs that might limit childbirth, although that was frequently a background and sometimes a foreground concern.The difficulty, of course, is extrapolating from \"lists of herbs in a 15C vernacular manual translated from a 12C Latin text carried over from a 9C Arab author.\" It's easy to say vernacular puts it closer to actual practice, since women were the drivers of vernacular literacy in the later Middle Ages, but the clear lines of reference to older academic tradition make those connections somewhat questionable.There is, however, ample court evidence to show that medical practitioners below the elite university physician level were indeed suppliers of birth control and abortifacient herbs. Anna Harding of Eichstatt is a fascinating case. She was accused of witchcraft in 1618. Legal records mention her as a provider of herbs to provoke menses (there's that language)--but that's not why she's in legal trouble! Intriguingly, Harding claimed that her potions--herbs mixed into liquid, a common type of remedy--could control menses altogether, whether that meant start, stop, reduce the flow, or even treat other conditions that might be causing the problem. (Incidentally, Harding uses herbal terms in her interrogation record, or at least the terms that are recorded, that don't match up with Riddle's lists as far as I can determine.)Another option for birth control was sexual practices. This is a *really* touchy subject in medieval sources. In canon law and the tradition of confessor's manuals, the language can get pretty explicit. (\"Ask him, if he has inserted his member into the holes in a board...\") But like the penitential referenced earlier, scholars debate whether these lists of sins for priests to ask their penitents about were actually ever used. If nothing else, they are a great guide to the celibate clerical...imagination. Yeah, definitely all in the imagination.Ruth Mazo Karras' fantastic study of prostitution in late medieval England, on the other hand, turned up one in/famous court case that seems to suggest [sexual intercourse beyond PIV](_URL_3_) was an important and widely accepted means of birth control. John (!) Rykener was a cross-dressing prostitute hauled into court. He claimed that none of his customers were ever the wiser about his being male. Many interpretations take this to mean intercrural or anal intercourse, the knowledge of both of which is attested in normative religious sources.One other option that I find fascinating is the potential use of breastfeeding as birth control. Although it's not absolute, breastfeeding can extend a woman's period of post-birth infertility. There is some evidence from both Christian and Jewish communities that some mothers sought to extend the time of breastfeeding a little bit longer than was typically prescribed. This is a particularly fruitful use of comparative Christian/Jewish studies. One of the phenomena that Elisheva Baumgarten uncovered was that, in contrast (or resulting in) statutes against Jewish and Christian women breastfeeding across religious boundaries, neighbors used to *swap off* breastfeeding duties to allow Jewish women to keep the Sabbath and Christian women to fast properly.There was certainly plenty of \"mercenary\" wet nursing in the Middle Ages, especially in Italy and among noblewomen. Although that second group merits a, well, second glance. For war, politics, family, compatibility, and sundry reasons, it was not the most unusual of circumstances for noble wives and husbands to spend months and years apart. See, of course, the dangers of pre/extramarital sex and out-of-wedlock pregnancy, which might kick the bucket further down the road rather than actually *solve* problems, but it does help explain why, given the pressures frequently on nobles to have the more offspring the better, there were so many families that had small numbers of legitimate children (even accounting for infant mortality--it's so sad to find mentions of unnamed children in chronicle accounts and letters...).And one more point is worth mentioned. Canon (Church) law sources and the lay people who wielded them in court reflect a persistent, deep-rooted fear that (primarily) women are using magic to render men impotent. So even while the writers of romances concocted love potions for their heroes and heroines to drink, clerics had a very different obsession.Medieval women, sometimes with the cooperation of their male partners, certainly had options when it came to attempting to prevent pregnancy. All signs suggest that many women sought to utilize them--sometimes temporarily, sometimes permanently; sometimes successfully, sometimes not so much.**Further reading:*** For THE CHART, see James Brundage, *Law, Sex, and Christian Society in Medieval Europe** Ruth Mazo Karras, *Common Women: Prostitution and Sexuality in Medieval England** Elisheva Baumgarten, *Mothers and Children: Jewish Family Life in Medieval Europe** John Riddle, *Conception and Abortion from the Ancient World to the Renaissance** Ulinka Rublack, *The Crimes of Women in Early Modern Germany** Margaret Brannan Lewis, *Infanticide and Abortion in Early Modern Germany** Dyan Elliott, *Spiritual Marriages: Sexual Abstinence in Medieval Wedlock** Catherine Rider, *Magic and Impotence in the Middle Ages*", "label": 0}, {"content": "During the middle ages and renaissance, people had to use condoms to protect themselves from pregnancy.

I'm not sure I can tell you a precise answer about the Aztecs, but I can tell you about Spanish attitudes regarding Native Americans in general.  It is generally accepted that modern ideas about race had not really existed for the first century or so of colonization.  What did exist was a much more fluid understanding of races and peoples, usually based on religion and culture.  To give you some idea of what I mean, we first have to grasp some understanding of the ways that early European settlers understood the New World in general.  The two most popular ideas were that the New World was an Edenic realm where the people had not been touched by original sin, while the other, not so coincidentally, was a land where Satan had total sway over the people.  Both of these views were religious at their core, but were polar opposites ideologically.  The important thing, however, is that in neither views were the natives *fundamentally* unchangeable.  A sinner can be saved and a Saint can fall, if you see what I mean.Second, the Spaniards in particular and the Europeans in general did not see their own races as necessarily fixed.  The ideas of the humors was current at the time with the idea that you had to balance the four humors to be healthy.  This idea was complicated by the fact that outside factors, including environment, effected the necessary balance.  So, the upshot is that many people thought that if you lived in a tropical place, such as most of Latin America and the Caribbean, you could literally turn into a person who looked like a native.  This did not even have to happen over generations.  The first Spanish settlers into the Caribbean imported, at great expense, foods that they would have eaten back in Spain, most notably grain which did not grow well in the new colonies.  At the same time, they tried to limit the amount of corn (maize) that they ate since it would turn them into Natives.  The flip side is that if Native Americans ate European food they could become more European. The question of Native wet nurses for Spanish children was also critical since the nurse could transfer her humors to the child.  An interesting later corollary occurred in the British colonies as late as the eighteenth century where many people believed that having sex with an African person (Usually a white woman having sex with a black man.  Let's play spot the sexism) would result in the white person literally darkening.A related issue, which the Colonists explicitly and frequently invoked to justify colonization was the classic \"good use of the land\" argument.  Most of Europe was heavily agricultural.  They saw the lack of cultivation of crops that they liked, i.e. wheat, grapes, etc. as proof that the Natives were inferior to the Europeans.  There were some attempts to \"Europeanize\" the Natives by giving them European clothes and teaching them how to cultivate the land like Europeans, but these efforts were often undercut by Imperial legislation, most particularly sumptuary laws.  The efforts to make the Natives European also raised a tricky practical question.  If these guys become like us, what is the justification for ruling them?A final factor, also religious, is that slavery in the 1500s was primarily based on religion and war.  Christians were not supposed to enslave other Christians, but Muslims, and frequently prisoners of war, were ok.  Of course, it did not take long for the Spaniards to effectively enslave many Native Americans on the well known *encomienda* and in the Spanish mines that dotted Latin America.  However, the Natives died off really fast and many of them had converted to Christianity as well, leading to both practical and theological problems with the arrangement.  Bartolemeo de las Casas famously defended the Native Americans and attacked their treatment before the King, though he also famously suggested African slaves to do the labor instead of Natives.Racial attitudes changed drastically during the seventeenth century, when more permanent notions concerning race began to develop.  By that time so many Natives had died that they posed little to no threat and the importation of African slaves began to take off in a big way.  The upshot of all this is that the inferiority of the Natives was heavily weighted toward culture and religion, rather than a modern understanding of race.  However, the exact degree of inferiority is a question in and of itself.  Not surprisingly, opinions differed greatly.  But, as the empire continued to expand and generate more profit, the Spanish (and later the other European empires) came up with other ideas to justify their rule, increasingly relying on race rather than religion.Hope this helps answer your question!Further reading: Earle, *The Body of the Conquistador* (probably the most applicable to your question), Block, *Ordinary Lives in the Early Caribbean*, De la Fuente, *Havana and the Atlantic in the Sixteenth Century*, Carmagnani, *The Other West* (This one is more a general history of Latin America, but it's good.)", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Spanish conquistadors viewed the Aztecs as a racially inferior people, a savage people who had a primitive culture and a primitive religion.

Four different running events (including the race in armor), and the pentathalon. So I think it is a *bit* unfair to Leonidas.The one that comes to mind is Phayllos of Kroton, who leapt so far he cleared the pit and broke his leg. As the pit was about fifteen meters long, this is well beyond the 8.9 Mike Powell managed in Barcelona. That being said, the sheer size of this leap has made plenty of people a bit leery, and it does seem to be straining against the limits of the possible, and so there is a bit of a debate over what the long jump was actually like. One possibility is that the weighted [halteres](_URL_0_) that the athletes apparently held while jumping was used in some way to add lift or effect the center of gravity, but modern testing hasn't really provided a comparable effect. The simpler explanation is that it was just a triple jump, which makes 15 meters extremely impressive but well within the 18.3 meters that is the current record.If you want to read more, Leuven has a great little site about the Olympics, I linked [Phyllos' page](_URL_1_).EDIT: it is worth noting that event athletics became proffessionalized to an extent during the Hellenistic and Roman periods. There were enough places hosting games that it was possible for a talented athlete to make a comfortable living going from Games to Games and surviving off of the prize money.

I can't unfortunately give you any names or anything too personal. But it was well documented that many members of the SS Einsatzgruppen had issues carrying out orders to kill people. For those who are unaware, the SS Einsatzgruppen were mobile killing squads sent into occupied territory to kill the Jews and other non-Aryans. They were a precursor to the camps, and they were used before the camps were built. Now the SS moved away from mass executions for two reasons, it was time consuming and wasteful, secondly many SS men refused to carry out orders. The men that did carry out the orders often required alcohol to get through with it. There aren't really any statistics for how many man refused on average, but it was significant enough to cause concern among the SS leadership. As Christopher Browning (author of the popular \"Ordinary Men\") put it, there were three types of SS men, those who had no issues carrying out the mass killings, those who had issues but used alcohol or other coping methods to carry them out anyways, and finally those who refused outright.To give you an idea how brutal these killings were, and how much of a psychological toll they took, here is what happened when Heinrich Himmler went to his one and only mass execution: >  Himmler became very uncomfortable, very quickly. As the firing squad started, Himmler, was even more nervous. During every volley he looked to the ground. When two women could not die, Himmler yelled to the police sergeant not to torture themHimmler tried to address this problem by making commanders organize social events and other outreach programs to make the men feel better, yet they were largely ineffective. Here is what a local SS commander, named Eirc Von Dem Bach, said to Himmler about his men's psyche after participating in the mass killings. >  Look at the eyes of the men of this Kommando , how deeply shaken they are. These men are finished for the rest of their lives.What kind of followers are we training here? Either neurotics or savages!The refusal to participate in mass killings was not usually punished. The punishments for refusing to partake in the mass killings would be usually a minor slap on the wrist (a transfer back to Germany,reduction in pay,demotion, small things like that), and that's in the rare cases where was something was actually done. Now soldiers that refused would face criticism from their peers;in the form of people questioning their masculinity and their allegiances. They also wouldn't be looked upon favorably for promotions or any sort of commendation. Now during the Belzec Trial, there were a few interesting stories that came out, many involving the head of the camp [Christian Wirth] (_URL_1_). Wirth ruled with an iron fist and anyone who dissented was punished. There are multiple stories that came out of Belzec concentration camp. One is that an SS man refused to carry out an execution and Wirth pulled a pistol on him. Or another example, when SS Erich Fuchs was ordered by Wirth to fix shower heads in the newly erected gassing barracks, he questioned Wirth as to why there were showers with no water pipes, Wirth flew into a rage and beat Fuchs; he then ordered two SS guards to take him away and shoot him, they ended up talking Wirth out of it.Source:Nazi Germany and the Jews 1933-1945 by Saul Friedlander[An online source] (_URL_0_) on the Belzec Trial", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Holocaust was a genocide of the Jewish people during World War II.

More to the point, like with the knights of Europe, while there was an official ideal of honor it was more prescriptive than descriptive and when you have a large group of heavily armed men some are going to be scumbags.Further, \"samurai\" simply meant \"person from the caste permitted to carry weapons\", towards the end of the Tokugawa period (1600-1868) a great many samurai class men had no real weapon training, a minimal pension from the government, and generally survived by running up debts which were nullified every few years by government edict. The Seven Samurai takes place earlier, in the Sengoku period (aka the Warring States Period), at a time of chaos and general confusion.  There was no centralized government, no rule beyond what the local warlord decreed and could enforce, and samurai (again, meaning \"people who carried weapons\", not \"super highly trained and deeply honorable warrior monk types\") were thugs enforcing the will of their local warlord, which usually meant stealing whatever they could from the peasants and calling it taxes.Or, worse, they were ronin.  When a warlord was defeated his soldiers (samurai) often just wandered off and turned to banditry to survive. There's a lot of mythology and several stories involving deeply honorable ronin seeking adventure and vengeance for the people who betrayed their lords, but mostly in real life they were just armed and trained men who took whatever they could from the people least likely to fight back.You might check out [State of War](_URL_1_), it's more about the somewhat earlier times than the Sengoku period, but most of what it covers applies to the later periods as well.For an interesting, often funny, first hand, primary source, account of daily life for a poor man of samurai class during the mid Tokugawa period check [Musui's Story](_URL_0_), it's a very quick read, an autobiography written by Musui himself, who lived a quite disreputable life and busts a lot of myths of the noble honorable samurai.TL;DR: even at the best of times, samurai were just soldiers, and historically soldiers weren't what you'd call very nice.

I've previously covered [what training Indiana Jones would have received](_URL_1_), what professors he would have had, and who his colleagues might have been. I've also looked into [what kind of school he taught at](_URL_2_)However, not much more can really be said about Indiana Jones' archaeological methodology, because we rarely see him in anything but extraordinary circumstances. The majority of the films are about him acquiring precious or powerful artifacts before someone nefarious does:* The Hovitos idol in the opening of *Raiders*, which Indy must get before Beloq* The Ark of the Covenant in *Raiders*, which Indy must find before the Third Reich uses it to conquer the world* The Sankara stone in *Temple of Doom*, which Indy must recover (there's nothing vageuly archaeological in the whole film, the entire film is set in towns/palaces/temples that are still in use)* The cross of Coronado in the opening of *Last Crusade*, which Indy tries to steal from looters* The Holy Grail in *Last Crusade*, which Indy must again reach before a Nazi officer uses it* The eponymous *Crystal Skull*, which Indy must steal back from the SovietsThe only instance where we see Dr. Jones doing any kind of research or, really, any kind of search that he instigated himself, is at the start of *Raiders*. The opening shots clearly show a well-equipped team loaded with all kinds of equipment for a proper excavation. It's not long before Indy realizes something is up. He takes Satipo alone into the Hovitos temple, and proceeds through it with extreme caution, showing the requisite skills for any archaeologist: keen observation, knowledge of the cultural context, and careful steps to avoid damaging the architecture or himself. Fully aware that there are less scrupulous people after him, Indy is very much in the right to take the idol and leave. Soon he is betrayed and captured, and we're left without knowing anything else of Indy's own interests.I'll admit that Indy's trek into the rat-infested tomb under Venice shows him in a more negative light- he rips some burial cloth for a torch. But when he and Elsa reach the knight's sarcophagus, Indy does a non-destructive rubbing of the lid, which, given the time constraints and non-feasibility of photography, seems reasonable. Indiana Jones is not a tomb raider because we never see him to set out to raid tombs. He clearly meant to do much more at the Hovitos temple than was actually done. He takes the Ark of the Covenant, or attempts to, so that the Nazis can't access the full power of God. He steals the Sankara stone back from the murderous cult that stole it from its proper owners. The entire point of the *Last Crusade* is that Indy is not interested in the goose chase that his father has gotten caught up in, but in spite of this must take a literal leap of faith to save his father and prevent the Nazis from getting the key to immortality. **If the question is tomb raiding or all-powerful Nazis, the correct answer is tomb raiding.**If he's not a tomb raider, then what is he?The Indiana Jones films are explicitly modeled after the pulp magazines, radio shows, and early comic books of the 1930s-1940s, as well as the adventure novels of the preceding decades. There's a clear inspiration for Indy in Allan Quartermain, Professor Challenger, and Doc Savage: characters whose bravado or inquiry lead to run-ins with exotic tribes, Lost Worlds, and ancient legendary ruins. This is the same tradition that gave us the secret identity: The Spider was  > !Richard Wentworth! < , The Shadow was  > !Kent Allard! < , and Batman was  > !Bruce Wayne! < . In a literary sense, Indiana Jones falls right into this trope. He's a vigilante who hides his activities from the public, but is known by an elite few for his exploits and by a trusted team of supporting allies. For this reason, I would argue that Indiana Jones is an archaeologist in the same way that Hal Jordan is an Air Force pilot or Peter Parker is a news photographer. Hal Jordan's pilot skills help him as a Green Lantern just as Indiana Jones' archaeology skills help him as an adventurer. The stories we see about him don't show him in his civilian career, but in pulp hero mode. ___But what of the archaeology of it?What Dr. Jones is doing is what we would call surface collection or salvage archaeology. Before any excavation, and sometimes during the initial survey and registration of a site, a team will collect artifacts that can be found on the surface, This will be done systematically and unobtrusively. Some archaeologists will plot transects (i.e. parallel, regularly spaced lines) that a team will walk across to record features, identify locations of high artifact concentration, and, as necessary, collect surface artifacts. Other projects prefer to this in grids, plotting out regular boxes that can be then assigned values. In either case, should artifacts be collected, their original location will be noted on a hand drawn map or with a GPS point, and they will often be photographed in situ. Why would archaeologists do this? First of all, because these artifacts are on the surface, it is unlikely that they are what we call a \"primary deposition,\" that is, where the culture that used it left. It is likely a case of secondary deposition, decontextualized by burrowing animals, erosion, or agricultural activity. Thus, we only lose so much information by collecting it. There is an entire disciple called \"taphonomy\" that is dedicated to the study of how things end up where they do, but, even then, the amount of taphonomic information on the surface is limited.Second, surface artifacts are very helpful for understanding a site before excavation, and therefore directing where further research takes place. Excavation is costly and destructive, and should be done as little as possible. Archaeologists want to be sure that any excavation they do will offer useful data. The form of artifacts can inform what kind of activities were happening in area, their style can help date the site, and their area of distribution can help define the coverage of habitation.Lastly, surface collection can be necessary in areas where looting is a real and present danger. An archaeological dig is a beacon for looters. In my own work, I've returned to an operation in the morning and found shovels and stacks of ceramic sherds left by lazy looters in nearby tombs. When artifacts are sitting in the open and looters are known to be active, it is much better to extensively document those artifacts and collect them than it is for them to be looted and never seen again.Thus, in the situation where a golden idol is sitting on a pedestal at a site you're about to excavate with a series of spikey traps in front of it, *you grab that idol.*I mentioned salvage archaeology because that's the closest real-world correlate to getting the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis do. There's an entire commercial field of archaeology called contract archaeology or Cultural Resource Management (CRM). In many countries, before major construction can begin, a contractor must submit an impact statement showing that the construction will not have a substantial environmental or geological impact. They must also prove that it won't have detrimental archaeological impact. If the state is building a highway bypass, or an electrical company is building a new line, or a town wants to institute a new technological park, they will hire a CRM team to survey the land that will be built on. We go out, dig a series of test pits, and look for any evidence of occupation. This is quick and dirty work. On my best days I could dig 25 of these \"Phase 1\" test pits. Unlike the slow, careful survey I describe above, Phase 1 CRM surveys try to cover as much ground as possible as quickly, but as orderly, as possible. You dig a hole (something like 30cm x 30cm, and down until you hit bedrock or sterile clay), you record the soil strata, and mark if you found any cultural material. Then you move on. When a hole is positive, you might dig some more in a grid around it. If there's a large cluster of positive test pits, you might move on to Phase 2: carefully excavating 1m x 1m test squares to identify cultural features (e.g. post holes, trash pits). If you've got cultural features, a Phase 3 excavation might be begin- you've got a site!You've also (usually) got a mad construction company. One week you're excavating is one week they're not building and one week their client has to wait. The fact that any archaeological survey is happening is great. But the pressure is always there to get moving so other folks can get building. There are great CRM firms, and I was privileged to work for an incredible one. There are also terrible ones. But in both cases, you are operating with the knowledge that everything you see is about to be destroyed to make way for a road, building, or parking lot. That means that if we do a Phase 2 operation and don't find any cultural features, we go in with a bulldozer to scrape away huge swaths of dirt 10cm at a time. Is this destructive? Heckin' duh. But it's exactly what's going to happen to the land anyways. It's a last ditch effort to find and salvage any cultural material that may be there.__", "label": 0}, {"content": "Indiana Jones is a fictional archeologist who is a hero in the movies.

These, in turn, drew on actual folk traditions, although one must use a great deal of caution to see them as accurately capturing contemporary folklore. One of the more important deviations that Tolkien imposed on the world of his creation was the idea of good and evil, which was largely absent from Northern European folk tradition. The dichotomy was a Church-based importation, and the folk were not quick to embrace it. Tolkien, perhaps because he was a committed Catholic but perhaps also for the facility of his concept of plot and literature, embraced the good-versus-evil approach to his world, and this required some \"tweaking\" of the legendary traditions that served as his inspiration.Although Icelandic sources include an odd reference to light and dark elves, there is no clear manifestation of such a concept in pre-modern Scandinavian, Icelandic, or British and Irish tradition. Nevertheless, Tolkien - drawing on this or simply setting off on his own - created a dichotomy where his elves were good and their counterpart, the orcs, played the role that one might imagine could have been assumed by \"dark elves.\" In reality, folk traditions regarded all supernatural beings a dangerous even though most were neither good nor evil. They were to be treated with caution and respect, and they were to be avoided if at all possible.Tolkien's dwarves are more at home in medieval primary literature than they are in pre-modern folk tradition.

(Sophomore adds on either a simple Latin -or 'operator' ending, or *possibly* Greek *moros*/fool--either way, the meaning is clear; the adjective \"sophomoric\" means immature). In the sixteenth century, *sophister* sometimes had an additional connotation of someone who takes money for teaching wisdom instead of ~~being an exploited adjunct~~ living a pure life of the mind or something--basically, a philosopher who sold out. This would track with the use of more advanced students employed to tutor earlier ones.What the OED and blog posts *won't* tell you, on the other hand, is why the labels for students are inherently *insults*.Medieval universities incubated a tradition that early modern ones would carry on with pride: periodically awful student behavior. (Also, you know, excellent academics  &  drool-worthy libraries  &  the foundation for modern scientific research  & c  & c.) Most infamous is student violence, of course--right along with universities' determination to shelter their own from charges of murder and rape.But more to the point with the classifications is that university students also had a reputation for living up to a somewhat lower standard than what Robert Lowth wanted to see in Oxford: >  [A place] where a liberal pursuit of knowledge, and a genuine freedomof thought was raised encouraged and pushed forward byexample, by commendation, and by authorityand somewhat more along the lines of what Edward Gibbon (yes, [our Edward Gibbon!](_URL_0_)) remembered: >  To the university of Oxford I acknowledge no obligation;and she will as cheerfully renounce me for a son, as I am willing to disclaim her for a mother. I spent fourteen monthsat Magdalen College; they proved the fourteen months themost idle and unprofitable of my whole life... >  In theuniversity of Oxford, the greater part of the public professorshave for these many years given up altogether even thepretence of teaching. >  Asa gentleman commoner, I was admitted to the society of thefellows, and fondly expected that some questions of literaturewould be the amusing and instructive topics of their discourse.Their conversation stagnated in a round of college business,Tory politics, personal anecdotes, and private scandal...The names of Wenman and Dashwood were more frequentlypronounced, than those of Cicero and Chrysostom.The point isn't that there were no deeply studious students making serious academic gains of their own and scientific progress overall, it's the *reputation* they had for being--well, *sophists*: more concerned with the social life of debate and politics and looking/acting smart to each other, than living up to some lofty ideal. Oxford opened its first coffeehouse in 1650. And by early modern coffeehouse, we should mean something like a literary salon--a place where the literati would gather to discuss intellectual topics and current events.Of course, to contemporary eyes, this was a great deficit from what it should be. A 1901 investigation of Oxford in the 18th century summed up its findings in this description of freshman, freshly-minted college men: >  We see the public schoolman, just freed from the rod ofBusby\u2019s successors, strutting about town for a week or sobefore entrance, courting his schoolfellows\u2019 envy...swaggeringat coffee-houses, and giving himself a scholar\u2019s airs at thebookshops.and things did not improve over the years: >  A month or two sees them metamorphosed into complete smarts...The \"smart's\" breakfast is scarcely over by ten.It's important to keep in mind that these attitudes were not only *external* in the sense of town-gown relations or alumni making a point about the quality of English universities compared to continental ones. Student university hazing could be absolutely brutal. Internal university hierarchy, built upon the idea that students with less experience were complete no-nothing fools, reigned supreme.Most infamously, there's a late medieval sort of \"Latin textbook\" for university students that consists of a series of dialogues we think were meant to teach students useful Latin vocabulary for surviving uni daily life. One of the settings is a violent and humiliating initiation ritual in which the freshman or *beanus* is made into an animal that must be tamed. Well, scholars will continue to dispute whether in the 15th century this was a literary fantasy that drew on a solid tradition of hazing. On the other hand, there seems to be fairly solid evidence that early modern students at some universities took the *description* as *prescription*--and performed the hazing ceremony.The straightforward etymologies of sophomore, junior (sophister), and senior (sophister) from Greek *sophia* and Greek/Latin *sophister*, in other words, aren't really the interesting part of the story--and a much funnier one for those of us who never attended college or have already graduated.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The term \"freshman\" is a shortened version of the word \"freshman year\", which is the first year of college.

The Dutch East India Company was a huge importer, and other European nations were eager to follow suit. Chinese porcelain was seen as a high-quality item when compared with contemporary European ceramics. Its delicacy, design and durability made porcelain a major consumer good in the Eurasian trade. Berg's [\"In Pursuit of Luxury: Global History and British Consumer Goods in the 18th Century\"](_URL_3_) (*Past and Present*, 2004) describes this trade and goes on to explain that when it came to Asian manufactured goods (including porcelain), \"these goods were ... not the ancient or Persian luxuries of corruption and vice, the gold and rubies of the Indies. They were luxuries associated with a civilized way of life, appealing especially to the middling classes.\"European manufacturers were no slouches, of course. When they saw the prices porcelain was fetching, they were eager to duplicate this \"white gold.\" Starting in the 18th century, they managed to do just that. Porcelain moved from a luxury product to a bourgeois one. In the 19th century, mass production allowed it to become a lower-class consumer good as well. At the same time, the men and women who worked in the factories creating European ceramics (and a bewildering variety of other products) had the money for hobbies and interests beyond the means of the lower class.One important thing to know about the middle class, and particularly the British middle class in the middle of the 19th century is the uncertainty of it all. Men and women alike were striving to join the upper classes, but they were uncertain whether their industrial employment was acceptable in polite society. I've written before about the [rise of the beard in the 19th century West](_URL_5_) as a reaction to the crisis of masculinity among the urbanizing middle class.This uncertainty about middle class life and constant striving toward respectability meant there was a surge in affectation: Middle-class households attempted to imitate aspects of upper-class society as best as they could afford. One of these affectations was the collecting of ceramics. The Chinese porcelain imported in the 17th century was extraordinarily high quality and highly collectible. In 1889, [the *New York Times* quoted a *Saturday Review* piece](_URL_6_) that explained, \"To a native collector an unquestionable piece of Sung Dynasty crackled porcelain is much what a Mazarin Bible is to a book collector among ourselves, and the best specimens of the products of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) are scarcely less valued. Vases within which are painted with lions rolling balls, or dragons with phoenixes, fetch prices which would astonish even the eager buyers at the salesrooms in King Street; and when genuine pieces of blue and white of this period are offered for sale they find a constantly rising market. It is recorded that about a hundred years ago a pair of cups of this last kind was valued by native collectors at \u00a3300.\"As Pierson writes on page 62 of her book, \"the notion of connoisseurship of such ceramics ... was not novel at this time at all, especially when connoisseurship as an activity was gaining in popularity and recognition through collector's clubs and related literature. ... Art dealers were also active in this arena with a number of shops in London featuring what were still often called 'oriental ceramics'. The art market was well developed and connoisseurship naturally accompanied this.\"Chinese porcelain, not just the high-quality material manufactured at Sevres or by Wedgwood, had a special cachet in this time period. During the 19th century, there was a surprising affinity for Chinese products and Western products that imitated Chinese styles in the technique known as *chinoiserie.* Authenticity was prized just as it is today, and the combination of the period's Sinophilia with the Euro-American penchant for antiquarianism meant older Chinese porcelain was valued. Ming porcelain itself was singled out for particular treatment starting in the 1870s. Charles Dickens' periodical, *All the Year Round*, mentions it specifically in its April 1875 issue, and the *Art Journal* references it as well that same year. Now, that's different from *the Ming vase*, which develops out of the general idea of Ming porcelain a few years later.In 1885, *The Decorator and Furnisher*, in a series of essays about Boston artists' studios, discusses the way high-quality Japanese and Chinese porcelain is displayed: \"You notice there is nothing in the room of a very white tone that is exposed to the light. A bust of Venus, in plaster, is in the dark corner on the piano top, side of it rests a brass tray and nearby is a Ming vase catching the light in silvery spots.\"As Pierson points out, this description is unusual for the time because it doesn't identify the porcelain as a \"Chinese vase\" or \"Old China\" or \"Blue China,\" but literally as a *Ming vase.* This is the period when we start to see people come to think of *the* Ming vase as a particularly high quality piece of art.Three years later, the *New York Times* publishes its first mention of *the* Ming vase in [a short story entitled (appropriately enough) *The Ming Vase*](_URL_4_), which awards that vase special, magical qualities appropriate for the Orientalist beliefs of the period in the West. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, ceramics collecting guides [take pains to point out the details of specific kinds of porcelain](_URL_7_), including Ming. Moreover, there's evidence that even though Ming is considered a quality item, it's not beyond the means of particularly focused middle-class buyers or of upper-middle-class buyers (at least in the early stages). In 1886, [there's an account of an 8-inch Ming vase being sold for \u00a313 in London](_URL_0_). As Pierson shows, Ming porcelain starts to show up in fiction at the end of the 19th century and the start of the 20th century. Edith Wharton's stories are a good example of this. In *The Fruit of the Tree* (published in 1907), there are shorthand references to \"Ming,\" referencing Ming porcelain and thus demonstrating its position as a high-class object. Fascinatingly, Pierson says that there's actually a divide between fiction and reality at this point. Qing porcelain, according to auction records, was fetching higher prices than Ming. Discussing [a new show at the Metropolitan Museum in 1916](_URL_1_), the *Times* wrote, \"A very considerable public is acquainted with the polished beauties of Chinese porcelain, but as yet comparatively few have had opportunity to become even superficially familiar with the noble line of Chinese ware antecedent to the true porcelain, although possessing certain of its characteristics. ... When the public learns the game it ardently pursues it, and one may predict in the near future a public hot on the trail of Sung and Tang.\"Instead, it was Ming porcelain that took the title and the public's interest, continuing to feature in popular fiction. In the 1920s, Pierson writes, there are repeated stories about unscrupulous art and antique dealers, mysteries involving murders or crimes targeting the Ming vase, and more. There's *Quinney's Adventures* in 1924, with a story involving a Ming vase fought over by two collectors. The winning collector lords his victory over the other, only to accidentally drop it and shatter it. For many of these stories, the Ming vase takes the role that the Maltese Falcon would hold in Dashell Hammett's eponymous work.Now, what about the smashing of the Ming vase in comedy? Well, there's nothing particularly unique about the vase in that regard. It's simply a widely known object that's both fragile and valuable. The comedy comes from its accidental destruction.

The stories are taken from the *Uncle Remus* books written by Joel Chandler Harris, who gathered them from African-Americans living around Atlanta after the Civil War. Often violent and scary, many of the folktales in the books are allegories for the horrors of slavery and white masters. The Disney adaptation, on the other hand, picks light-hearted stories, matches them with joyful and cute animation, and turns the frame story into a recreation of the antebellum Southern fantasy (mansion of the slave owners, black sharecroppers in shacks, the stock characters of Mammy, Pickaninny, and of course the \"good slave\" Uncle Remus)--complete with a Magical Negro twist to make the white boy's family all good again.This alteration was readily apparent to critics of the time. Walter White, the executive director of the NAACP, rather diplomatically commented: >   Making use of the beautiful Uncle Remus folklore, *Song of the South unfortunately gives the impression of an idyllic master-slave relationship which is a distortion of the facts.*White wrote this after the film's release, but he had been one of the voices in protest when news of an Uncle Remus adaptation leaked out in 1944. According to Thomas Cripps, these early efforts framed themselves as helpful--and it wasn't a stretch, since (as Cripps documents) World War II had served/was serving as a major turning point for black representation in movies (and complaints from the NAACP and other groups when Hollywood was seen to fail). So White, Alain Locke (a former Rhodes Scholar), and Hollywood writers Caleb Peterson and Leon Hardwick reminded Disney to be good about representation or risk massive protests, to avoid \"lowering black morale\" for the war and for America. Disney even initially hired a script doctor to redo the film, and he had plans of mixing the Remus tales with stories drawn from the WPA ex-slave narratives (no, really!). Ultimately, the company reverted to original plans.The controversy was not quelled upon release. Matthew Bernstein compiled an impressive array of excerpts from contemporary reviewers and commenters. On one hand, you had (white newspaper) *Atlanta Constitution* reporter Doris Lockman's commentary on the film's Atlanta premiere: >   [The crowd] ...saw the honest red dirt of Georgia, the weathered cabins that huddle on friendly mounds under tall pines, the dusty shabby old servitors of a kindlier day, focused richly amid the magic wrought from the homely philosophy of Joel Chandler Harris and moulded into reality in the facile fingers of Walt Disney and his crew...  >  It was everybody's picture. Grandmother, seeing it, could remem- ber the golden days of yesterday. Her daughter, beside her, reached for snatches of tales long sleeping and the modern ones realized restively that much has gone from life that could ill be spare.In contrast, *New York Times* columnist Bosley Crowther insisted it was *by no means* \"everybody's picture\": >  For no matter how much one argues that it's all childish fiction, anyhow, the master-and-slave relation is so lovingly regarded in your [Disney's] yarn, with the Negroes bowing and scraping and singing spirituals in the night, that one might almost imagine that you figure Abe Lincoln made a mistake. Put down that mint julep, Mr. Disney!Ann Tanneyhill of the National Urban League emphastically denounced the movie's \"black ,fat, greasy, sweaty, laughing, grinning, eyes rolling, white teeth showingpredominantly, bowing, scraping hat in hand\" stereotype. NAACP leader Gloster Current rejected the joint stereotype-myths of the docile slave and that black people *liked* slavery.And some people suggested further action was necessary. NAACP director White, in response to actually seeing the film, proposed that the organization create a screening or censoring branch to preview. Mary McLeod Bethune called for production companies to include a wider variety of non-white characters in movies with the prescient idea that this might affect overall attitudes towards people of color (she says \"minority groups,\" so, not just black people).And so even while the harshest critics felt obligated to praise the movie's artistic achievements (probably a mixture of heartfelt and diplomatic, depending on critic), *Song of the South* was in all likelihood a massive economic failure even at the time. Certainly it has failed to provide Disney with the same financial and popular legacy as other wildly problematic movies (\"where they cut off your ears if they don't like your face,\" anyone?).Cripps concludes, \"*Song of the South* clarified movie politics as had noother movie since *Gone with the Wind.*\" Protests over racial representation and racist stereotypes in movies are hardly an invention of the Internet age.Further Reading:* Thomas Cripps, *Making Movies Black: The Hollywood Message Movie from World War II to the Civil Rights Era* (1993) - and if you're interested, *Slow Fade to Black* which covers 1900-1942* Matthew Bernstein, \"Nostalgia, Ambivalence, Irony: *Song of the South* and Race Relations in 1946 Atlanta,\" *Film History* 8, no. 2 (1996)* Daniel Stein, \"From Uncle Remus to *Song of the South*: Adapting Plantation Fictions,\" *The Southern Literary Journal* 47, no. 2 (2015)", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Disney movies that have been criticized for their portrayal of racial groups are not only a modern controversy, but they were also criticized back when they came out.

One of the features that makes slavery in the United States so distinctive and so unique in history is that it was constructed along racial lines; in fact, the very idea of race is so essential to the story of North American slavery that you really can\u2019t separate them out at all.It seems easy to imagine that we\u2019ve always had the notion that there are \u2018black people\u2019 and \u2018white people\u2019 as racial identities. Everyone has a skin colour, right? Except before the 16th Century, Europeans really *don\u2019t* have a notion of \u2018race\u2019 like we do today. A white European person from the 15th Century simply would not understand the racial framework we have in western society today. Race is a social construct, a means of categorising people according to a particular physical characteristic; there is no reason why we should have a concept of race and if you were to line everyone in the world up side by side, you simply wouldn\u2019t be able to neatly categorise a vast swathe of people in the middle.The western and particularly North American concept of race is intimately associated with the experience of New World slavery. Whilst it\u2019s wrong to say that we only have a conception of \u2018black\u2019 and \u2018white\u2019 as racial categories because of slavery, you simply cannot unpick one neatly from the other; as slavery develops so too does the American sense of race, and racism.New World slavery was a thoroughly, intrinsically racist system \u2013 it was constructed as a system of debasement and exploitation based on the notion that black Africans were inherently inferior and more acutely suited to intense labour than white Europeans. Particularly by the 19th Century in the South, to be black meant to be a slave; to be free was to be white. This is how slaveholding society conceptualised race. There were free black people certainly, but they were an abnormality, an aberration; they existed in a strange world between true freedom (which was the preserve of white people and especially white men) and enslavement. There is a symbiotic relationship between race and slavery in the United States, and many of the racial problems that plague the US today are the direct result of the racial construction of slavery. For that reason, we must be extremely careful about discussing notions of 'white slavery'.What you might have sometimes heard of referred to as \u2018white slavery\u2019 is a practice from the colonial period known as *indentured servitude*. As it was notionally constructed, this was a practice whereby white workers from Europe would agree to sign up to work as labourers in the New World for a fixed term, usually seven years, at the conclusion of which they would be given compensation for their services in the form of either land, cash or both. Essentially, indentured servants would go to the New World \u2013 to places like Barbados or Virginia \u2013 initially as labourers and workers, and at the end of their term of service, become settlers who could forge their own destiny and fortune in the New World.Now, despite this theoretically being a free arrangement, a great many of these indentured servants were \u2013 through a variety of means of coercion \u2013 sent to the New World against their will. Likewise, the conditions of work and life they experienced, particularly in the Caribbean, were far from ideal and were often intense and gruesome. This was certainly no working holiday; mortality rates were high for those workers going to the New World, their rights were certainly restricted and their masters had considerable jurisdiction over them for much of the colonial period. Institutional frameworks sprung up around indentured servitude to help enforce it in law and practice, frameworks which inspire the laws and mechanisms that helped to enforce slavery. So certainly, we can identify similarities with slavery. But this is not a system of slavery per se.One of the fundamental differences is that indentured servitude comes with three implicit distinctions: it is intended to be a *temporary* arrangement, it is a contract entered into by two (theoretically) mutually consenting free persons, and the servant is not considered to be the legal property of their master; the servant retains a legal identity as a free person. Contrast that with African slavery. Slaves do not need to even theoretically consent to the arrangement of slavery, it is automatically construed to be servitude until death, and the slave is reduced to property. An indentured servant remains a person in law with rights and dignities \u2013 their employer\u2019s power over them stems not from a condition of ownership, but rather from a contract into which the servant has entered. In slavery, the master\u2019s owner stems from the fact that the slave is legally their property to do more or less with as they please. Furthermore, at least on paper, there is an implied mutually beneficial relationship in indentured servitude: the master gets low-cost labour for the better part of a decade, the servant gets considerable compensation at the end of their service.Now certainly, abuses were abound in this system. Many servants died from neglect or abuse before they ever came to the end of their service; others had employers who would try to cunningly trap servants into perpetual work by extending the length of their contracts as punishment for infractions against it, or as collateral against loans. We might say that some servants ended up suffering slave-like conditions. But again, we generally stress that this was not really slavery; the construction of the system and the institutional framework that surrounds it is qualitatively and substantially different. Slavery as it came to be practiced in the United States was characterised by a systematic and institutional degradation and dehumanisation of its victims in both practice and theory; they were literally reduced to Human property both legally and in practice. Whilst in some ways servants came to be treated as property, particularly in the British Caribbean, it is recognised that there were limits imposed by cultural and institutional frameworks.Where there has been a more genuine and ongoing debate among historians is what the relationship between white indenture and black slavery is. Some conceptualise black slavery as having *begun* as a kind of indentured servitude; others (myself included) insist black slavery was always functionally distinct from white servitude. But in the historiography a distinction is broadly maintained between indentured servants and African slaves; Hilary Beckles conceives indenture as a form of \"proto-slavery\" but stops short of describing it as the same system. And indeed, whichever side you take in that debate, there are points where servitude and slavery exist side by side - and contemporaries certainly make qualitative differences between the two. Indentured servitude has similar features and it helped to shape the development of racial slavery, but it is not inherently the same as the system of racial African slavery (or, for that matter, Native American slavery, which was also practiced). They are related, but distinct, forms of unfree labour.**Selected sources:*** Winthrop Jordan, *White over Black: American Attitudes Toward the Negro, 1550 - 1812* (1968).* Winthrop Jordan, *The White Man's Burden: Historical Origins of Racism in the United States* (1974) [this is an abridged reconstruction of the above book, more suitable for general readerships]* Christopher Tomlins, *Freedom Bound: Law, Labor, and Civic Identity in Colonising English America, 1580 \u2013 1865* (2010).* Hilary Beckles, *White Servitude and Black Slavery in Barbados 1627 - 1715* (1990).* Hilary Beckles, \"Plantation Production and White \"Proto-Slavery\": White Indentured Servants and the Colonisation of the English West Indies, 1624 - 1645\", *The Americas* 4, no. 3 (1995): 21 - 45.* Alden Vaughan, \"The Origins Debate: Slavery and Racism in Seventeenth-Century Virginia\", *The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography* 97, no. 3 (1989): 311 - 354.EDIT: I am busy tonight.

As they remark, \"modern nations and all their impedimenta generally claim to be the opposite of novel, namely rooted in remotest antiquity, and the opposite of constructed, namely human communities so 'natural' as to require no definition other than self-assertion.\" and that also applies to many a symbol or practice associated with that new nation and national sentiment. From supposedly ancient Scottish clan tartans that were introduced in the 19th century to the martial arts of Japan, the nationalist movement lies at the base for a lot of these supposedly ancient traditions and symbols.This also applies to the idea of Swiss neutrality since the 16th century since that narrative was created in the 19th century under specific historical circumstances to which I'll get in a minute.To start off with the traditional narrative: It is generally held that the old Swiss Confederacy (Eidgenossenschaft) adopted neutrality after the battle of Marignano in Lombardy when Swiss mercenaries fought against France in the battle for rule over Northern Italy and suffered a terrible defeat where the Swiss mercenaries suffered between 8000 and 10000 casualties. The exact politics behind the battle are complicated and not exactly my expertise but what is important is that the troops of the Swiss confederacy fought against the French who desired control over Northern Italy. The battle had far reaching consequences: It ended all expansionist politics of the old Swiss Confederacy, showed that mercenaries were not the best way to fight wars anymore and forced the Confederacy to sign a peace treaty with France that put the Swiss Confederacy under the cultural and political influence of France. Within the Confederacy it ended a period of communal foreign policy that had been difficult to maintain even beforehand, mainly because of the religious split of the various cantons.When Marignano is cited today the prevailing narrative behind it is that the defeat was so terrible that from it grew the policy of Swiss Neutrality that was maintained basically until up to today. But that narrative has actually little basis. The way it came about shows the intentions behind it:Modern Swiss Neutrality has its origins in the Vienna Congress of 1815 when the European powers after having defeated Napoleon agreed that it was sensible to have a neutral Switzerland in their midst. France and Austria originally planned for Switzerland to become a satellite state while Prussia wanted to integrate it in the German Bund. Because there were so many plans and so many competing interests, these powers ultimately agreed for Switzerland to remain neutral and thus the modern legal concept of state neutrality was born.As most of the people familiar with Switzerland know, it is a rather hands off state and was especially so during the 19th century. In the latter half of that century, it also became a safe haven for people forced to flee other European countries because of their political views (probably the most famous example being Lenin). Now when Bismarck in Germany passed his famous \"Socialist Laws\". which outlawed socialist, communist and social democratic political activity, many German socialists and communists fled to Switzerland in order to escape persecution.Because Switzerland did not invest too much in police observing these socialists as well as other left-wingers from Russia and France, various European powers started to send spies in order to keep tabs on the various left-wing politicians and activists. One of these spies, a German named August Wohlgemuth was arrested in the Canton Aargau in 1889 and charged with espionage. This lead to an open political conflict with Bismarck. He demanded the release of Wohlgemuth and rallied his allies behind him. Germany, Russia, and Austria send diplomatic notes to Bern threatening to nullify the statue of Swiss neutrality from 1815 should Switzerland refuse to keep tabs on the political exiles in accordance with their demands. The gist was: Neutrality was a gift from the European powers and as such it could rescinded whenever they wished.This did not go down well in Switzerland. Enter Paul Schweizer, state archivist of Z\u00fcrich and historian. Publishing a nine part series in the Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung (NZZ) in 1889 \u2013 which would later become the core of his monumental monography on the subject of Swiss neutraltiy \u2013 he started out to oppose the idea that Swiss neutrality was something bestowed upon the Swiss by the European powers but rather something that had a massive deal of history behind it. Because he had virtually no legal argument at his hands, he advanced a historical one that was build upon the idea of imbuing Swiss neutrality with legitimacy independent of  the European powers because of its long and storied (and in many ways not really well-founded) history. As Andreas Suter argued, the idea that Switzerland in the early modern period was a neutral country was \"at its core a response to a monumental foreign policy crisis and a threat by the European powers\".Following Schweizer's publication and his monograph, the idea of Marignano being the origin of Swiss neutrality that had since been strictly maintained took hold and until this day plays a central role in Swiss political discourse.However, historiography has long contested the myth of Marignano and neutrality. Emil Usteri in his book *Marignano. Die Schicksalsjahre 1515/1516 im Blickfeld der historischen Quellen.* was the first one to call the narrative into question by re-examining the historical sources following the battle and finding no evidence of a decision to become neutral. In recent years Andreas Suter, Swiss historian at the German university of Bielefeld, has published a lot concerning this question providing further prove that the idea of 500 years of Swiss neutrality is an invented tradition of the late 19th century.Sources:* Andreas Suter: Neutral seit Marignano?

There are two main \"classes\" of war hammer that were used at various points in the late Medieval period (roughly 14th-16th Centuries). The first was the standard, one-handed \"war hammer,\" or \"horseman's hammer\" which actually looked at bit like the modern tool with which it shares part of its name, except instead of the crow's foot on the back end, it had a single spike. The front end was often crenelated, or dimpled, as well. The second type was the \"maul,\" which was a war hammer with a long handle that originated primarily as a tool for driving spikes, and was adapted later into an improvised (and then official) military weapon. The two most common types of mauls were the Bec-de-Corbin, known as the poleaxe in English, and the Lucerne hammer, which was made famous -- as its title attests -- by the Swiss, but there were a variety of different polearms that used hammer-like attacking ends.**Rise of the War Hammer**Hammers came about in the mid-late Medieval period primarily as a response to advanced armor technology. This period in history was a literal arms race, in which armorers were always striving to better protect their clients from the weapons of the day, and bowyers, fletchers, smiths, and others were always trying to ensure the armorers couldn't do this. By the late-ish Medieval period, the armorers had created suits of plate or plate-combined-with-other-stuff that were so hard and smooth that swords would just bounce off them. This was, needless to say, not only ineffectual, but a genuine hazard, as sword strikes could ricochet. Since swords were one of the more common weapons for knights to use on each other up to this point, Medieval knights looked for an alternative.One alternative was to find weapons that, instead of slashing, would pierce the armor. Medieval medical technology wasn't very advanced, and battlefield medicine, as such, was basically nonexistent, so a successful piercing attack, even if small, could be fatal. English archers developed special arrowheads and powerful bows for this purpose, and there was a large shift in knights to polearms for single combat here. This explains the spike on the end of war hammers -- it was used to pierce armors and deliver potential killing blows. This was also useful for hooking onto enemy weapons, shields, and reins, and pulling them away from enemy control.One problem with this, though, at least as far as the war hammer is concerned, is that spikes can get stuck in the holes they create. Also, Medieval knights could wear a suit or shirt of chain or rings under their plate, which would be much more effective at distributing spike attacks, and could render wounds very small. This, combined with the potential loss of your weapon in the face of an enemy who was likely to be pretty pissed off that you just tried to kill him, made simple spiked weapons dangerous as a first option.Enter the hammer. Medieval warriors may not have understood the principles of surface area and transference of force, but they knew damn well that if you hit a guy hard in the head with a heavy, flat object, no helmet was going to protect him from major head trauma, concussions, blackouts, or at least some wooziness and pain. Also, if you hit someone with a relatively flat surface, there's not much chance the weapon will embed and disarm you -- indeed, it's pretty likely to just bounce back and get you ready for a second blow. Hammers are perfect for this. So, as armor got stronger, knights gravitated toward hammers and other hammer-like objects. **How popular were they?**It's difficult to say for certain, but it seems that [mauls and hammers were a weapon of choice](_URL_0_) for the well-to-do knight at arms in the later Medieval period. The one-handed hammer was used primarily by cavaliers on horseback, and when dismounted, they would switch to the heavy maul. We have many, many of these weapons extant in museums, and many are very well made, inlaid, and must have been quite expensive. Many factors point to their very common use. For example, a glance at the [War of Troy Tapestry](_URL_2_), ca. 1490, and extant copies of [*The Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald*](_URL_1_), ca. 1450s, both prominently show mauls and hammer-like polearms in the hands of the highest-level nobles and warriors. A famous fresco depicting [Godfrey of Bouillon](_URL_3_), dating from the 1420s (the fresco, not Godfrey himself, who was alive in the 12th century), prominently shows Godfrey holding a poleaxe, which the artist no doubt conjectured was an appropriate and common weapon for such a high ranker (in point of fact, it almost certainly was not, but is instructive in terms of what must have been its commonality in the artist's time). Poleaxes are also known to have been used in duels between knights, and we know of a special poleaxe called the *hache* (which just means \"axe\" in French, compare the English \"hatchet\") that was designed exclusively for duels. Surely such weapons must have been very common among knights to be preferred for duels and have had a special version made for them. Also, Italian fencing master Filippo Vadi, wrote *De Arte Gladiatoria Dimicandi*, a manual for fencing with various weapons, that is accompanied by a variety of colored illustrations, some time in the early-mid 15th Century. The book and the illustrations both have segments focusing on the maul, [which you can see here](_URL_4_).Were they used by people other than knights? Possibly. The Medieval German word for poleaxe appears to have been *fussstreihammer,* which, according to the article I know on the subject, means something like \"infantry war hammer.\" So, it's possible that, at least in Germany, landsknechts and other footsoldiers were using these weapons both in the Medieval period and beyond. There have been skulls found at large Medieval battle sites, as well, that show damage consistent with hammer-like strikes, although this is hard to verify for certain.**Conclusion**In my view, it's pretty safe to say that war hammers were commonly used during the Medieval period, especially the later Medieval period. However, war hammers like Thor's Mj\u00f6lnir, or like those you see in a Dungeons and Dragons illustration, were probably not much used. What was used were one-handed weapons more akin to modern tool hammers, and especially, from the evidence I've seen, two-handed mauls that shared characteristics with other pole-arms, such as halberds and pikes.

Typical concoctions would involve mushed beans or rice acquired on the West African coast, made into a seasoned pulp that might, if you were 'lucky', have a little meat in it. Most slave ships would carry enough food to ensure a minimum level of rationing in the event of spoilage. Water would be distributed in strictly rationed quantities two to three times a day, usually alongside food and in a quantity of about half a pint. If weather did not permit the bringing of captives on deck in groups for feeding, food would instead be distributed in confinement in communal tubs. If an individual African was not willing to eat, or desired to commit suicide by starvation, they could be 'safely' (from the perspective of the crew) force-fed using a scissor-like medical instrument that was designed to hold open the Human jaw. Given the conditions of malnutrition and dehydration however, most enslaved persons would have welcomed the little food and water they were provided with, particularly after several days on board.Large buckets of wood or metal were provided for slaves to relieve themselves in - given that they were kept manacled in some fashion at all times though, this was often not particularly practical, and it would have been all too common for slaves to be forced to relieve themselves within their holding areas. Some effort was certainly made to clean both individuals and confinement areas on most slave ships, but this was not always possible or practical, especially on ships that had a shortage of crew (often caused by the death of sailors during the voyage, who themselves were also battling malnutrition and disease even if their conditions were not as wretched). Feeding, cleaning and exercise time also in theory provided opportunity to identify Africans who were succumbing to illness and remove them to other parts of the ship on vessels with spare space; in practice though, this was an ineffective strategy even when it was employed, given that any illness that manifested itself was likely the result of appalling conditions. Problems were compounded by the fact some Africans would have been vomiting bile and blood from sickness (of sea or disease), or have open sores and other wounds that could leak.In terms of mortality, it is impossible for us to know precisely how many individuals lost their lives in the course of the transatlantic slave trade. The best estimate we have - based on a comprehensive survey of surviving records of slave vessels for all major European powers - puts the total number of African men, women and children who died making the journey on slave ships to the New World at a little over 1.82million between 1501 and 1866, though the true figure could certainly be higher. Generally speaking, the pattern is one of declining mortality across the period of the slave trade as European governments sought to respond to abolitionist critique of conditions and slave traders themselves sought new ways to maximise the survivability rates of their Human cargo. In the case of slave traffic by vessels flying British or American flags, the mortality rates were approximately as follows by half century:* 1501 - 1600: 29%* 1601 - 1650: 22%* 1651 - 1700: 24%* 1700 - 1750: 18%* 1751 - 1800: 14%* 1800 - 1850: 13%^Figures ^taken ^from ^the ^Transatlantic ^Slave ^Trade ^DatabaseNote that both Britain and the United States abolish the slave trade after 1807 - though it does continue in an illicit form for some years afterwards, it was probably not a substantial enterprise. You can see then that the general trend was one of declining mortality through the period, but the British/American slave trade alone killed nearly 600,000 people, in addition to the 2.9million it successfully delivered into slavery in the New World. The Atlantic ocean became a literal burial ground for the bodies of millions of African men, women, boys and girls whose lives were claimed by any combination of malnutrition, disease and violence. The brutal experience of the middle passage was not something that was accidental: although slave vessels had a vested interest in delivering as many people as possible to the New World, the entire process of being degraded in this extreme and heinous fashion was part of the system by which slavers could hope to break the spirit and sense of Human dignity in their victims. It was a system that was inherently violent and recognised as such, intended purposefully to demonstrate to Africans how little they were worth as people in the eyes of their captors, and enforce from the very beginning their place in the racially stratified social order of the New World.It is also worth pointing out that the image of the slave trade popularised in most famous depictions is perhaps a little inaccurate. At least on British slave vessels, standard practice was only that adult men would be kept chained below decks; space permitting, adult women and girls would be kept in a separate holding area without the same physical restraints (though still in horrendous conditions), whilst young boys would either be kept separate again or also with the women. It was often young male children who had the most liberal experience of captivity during a slave voyage, being permitted a limited amount of roaming freedom on some slave vessels. This was by no means a uniform experience - there was no standardised slave ship design, only common patterns, but it was typical only for adult men to endure the most horrendous physical restrictions on their movement and liberty, as they were perceived to be the most dangerous. The marginally increased autonomy given to women and children, however, was compromised by the fact that they were at constant risk of sexual exploitation and gratuitous violence from members of the crew.And perhaps most importantly, it should be emphasised that Africans did not simply accept their fate and wait for whatever would come. We know that on many vessels Africans sought to find ways to resist their captors, from small displays of autonomy - like using the relative freedom of children to ferry messages of support to and from the segregated groups - to full out acts of violent insurrection. We know of literally hundreds of acts of violent resistance on the part of African people to European slavers, including dozens of major violent uprisings on slave vessels. Although we are accustomed to think of the shackles and chains of the slave trade as icons of destructive domination and exploitation, it is important to remember that they also demonstrate the white European fear and terror in the face of African agency and resistance. That such extreme and violent measures of control were widely recognised as necessary, and the threat of revolt taken so seriously, is testament to the fact that no matter how hard they tried to destroy African identity and dehumanise African people, European exploiters were still on some level aware of the determined and resistant spirit that their captives had, and they were very much afraid of it. It is very likely that there were many, many more smaller acts of resistance and defiance that have gone unrecorded or undiscovered in the historical record. It is important to remember that whilst African victims of the slave trade suffered the most incredible degradation and abuse, they remained real people with real agency, and they sought to exercise that agency.There are two books I would recommend for the account they give of the slave trade in an engaging and accessible fashion. The first is Audra Diptee's *From Africa to Jamaica: The Making of an Atlantic Slave Society, 1775 - 1807*, which makes the compelling argument about no matter how hard slave traders tried to diminish and degrade the Humanity of African people, they could not ignore it in their Human cargo. The other is a case study by James Walvin, titled *The Zong: A Massacre, The Law and the End of Slavery*, which is a focused analysis of the infamous Zong massacre in which hundreds of Africans were murdered in cold blood for an insurance claim. It takes this singular journey to make powerful insights about the wider slave trade, and offers a fascinating account of one of the slave trade's most notorious individual journeys of passage. Both are recent books benefiting from some of the cutting edge developments in the historiography of the transatlantic slave trade, and both should have been in print for long enough to be relatively easy to find.EDIT: I'm also going to use this opportunity to exploit the attention this thread gets to remind you all that we have our *hugely* exciting *Roots*-themed AMA tomorrow, June 3rd, featuring four historians that I am *ridiculously* excited we have fielding questions for us.

If you look at [this chart](_URL_1_) you can see that while 1876 was the highpoint, it wasn't exactly an anomaly, and voter turnout was consistently high in the elections preceding it. It sticks out because, although the drop wasn't *immediately* afterwards, it certainly preceded the continuing decline in voter turnout that would mark the next half-century.So why did voting decline in that period? Well, one of the most simple reasons to look at is Jim Crow. While under Reconstruction, black men (women being generally deprived of the vote) could, for the most part, go to the polls and exercise their right to vote, this began to change after Reconstruction was ended (not to say it didn't happen before, just not as effectively), and the Redeemer governments worked through various means to disenfranchise vast swathes of voters in the American South. The effect of this can't be underrated. While in the 1876 election the South saw turnout roughly comparable to the rest of the country, at 75 percent, vote suppression methods such as literacy tests not to mention outright fraud, saw the turnout decline to 46 percent at the turn of the century. By the 1924 election, *19 percent* of those theoretically eligible to vote were actually showing up at the polls. And to be sure, while the primary target was black voters, many poorer, illiterate whites were disenfranchised too, despite \"loopholes\" to grandfather many of them in. In Louisiana, for instance, while 90 percent of black voters were barred from the polls, 60 percent of whites were as well. While Jim Crow should absolutely be understood as primarily a racial regime, it was quite oligarchical as well, with power being concentrated in the hands mostly of upper-class whites, who wanted to share it with no one.This allows us to circle back somewhat though to look at 1876, and why it would be slightly above the average of the time though. During the Reconstruction era there were *real efforts* to mobilize poor voters of both races by the Radical Republicans. The example I'm most familiar with was that led by Mahone in Virginia whose Readjuster movement controlled the state for a brief time in the late 1870s-early'80s, propelled by populist support from a coalition of black voters and poor whites. I won't spend to much time on him as I've written about him before [here](_URL_0_) but the short of it is that in the post-war era, but before Jim Crow laws took hold, we can see a lot of political agitation that struck at the white Democratic establishment in the South that was attempting to reclaim power, and that *for a time* they enjoyed some successes. The 1876 election in particular we can look at as a watershed, with both sides of the argument over Reconstruction seeing heavy stakes. And of course Tilden won the popular vote, but lost anyways, as part of a deal that did end Reconstruction anyways. That cessation meant the evaporation of the Federal protections that allowed those insurgent political movements to compete on a roughly level playing field. Changes weren't immediate, and varied state by state - in Virginia for instance the Readjusters remained in power until 1883, when race riots days before the election were used by the Democrats to stoke voter fears - but it nevertheless meant that the suppression of the black vote and the poor white vote was able to start, a process which wasn't immediate, and took time to take full effect.It can also be said that while Jim Crow was unique to the American South, similar political tactics were not unknown throughout the country, just in different ways. In the Northern and Western states, turnout had dropped to 55 percent by the 1920 election, after all, and while it cannot be blamed on *institutional* barriers such as those in the South, responses to political mobilization by immigrants and lower-class groups *outside* the South by political elites saw attempts at \"demobilizing what they judged to be the least desirable components of the electorate\". They may not have been legally barring them from the polls, but through the late 1800s and early 20th century, they certainly were attempting to dissuade them from showing up.So as I have tickets for Thor at 10, and my wife is giving me *the look*, I'll wrap this up with a quick summation. In short, voter turnout in the United States was consistently fairly high up until the 1880s. The apex of turnout in 1876 isn't exactly an anomaly if we look at the turnouts in votes around it, such as 1868 at 78.1%, or 1880 at 79.4%, but it does coincide with a period in American history rife with political upheaval, not just the American South, still on the tail end of Reconstruction, but nationwide, with Populist movements in the ascendant. The end of the century, and the early 1900s, thus provide a stark contrast, as attempts both at institutional vote suppression, as well as simple 'demobilization' of cohorts of voters, lead to a decline in turnout nationwide.Levin, Kevin M. 2005. \u201cWilliam Mahone, the Lost Cause, and Civil War History.\u201d The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography 113 (4): 502\u20133.Winders, Bill. 1999.

It was not a black flag with a red dragon on it, as depicted in *Outlaw King*, but rather was shaped like the [Roman draco](_URL_2_), a sort of windsock with an openmouthed metal head with red fabric attached to it. When turned towards the wind, the fabric would inflate and writhe. I have also found no evidence of those accompanying the banner wearing the same dragon on their tabards, as the Prince of Wales and some of his knights do in the film.The banner was first used by the Anglo-Saxon kings simply as a royal standard. In 752 it was used by the king of Wessex in a battle against the Mercians, in 1016 against Cnut, and in 1066 at Hastings, [as seen on the Bayeux Tapestry](_URL_1_). It was only after the Conquest that it seems to have had a wider significance relating to the conduct of war. From Richard I (the first English king to revive the tradition) onwards, the banner appears to have been used exclusively against those considered to be rebels or infidels, associating it with *guerre mortelle* or Roman war, war without limits where no mercy had to be shown to enemies. The only legitimate targets of such war, according to medieval theorists, were rebels and infidels (though some, like Thomas Aquinas, considered rebels to be exempt from this). The banner was used by Richard I in 1191 against Saladin at Arsuf, Henry III in 1245 and 1257 against the Welsh (who he referred to as rebels), 1264 against the barons, Edward I against the Scots (who he claimed sovereignty over), and Edward III at against the French in 1346 (whose throne he claimed).Though some historians have been dubious that the dragon banner declared mortal war, several of medieval chroniclers certainly saw it as such. John of Oxnead (d. after 1293) described it as 'a sign of death and great retribution', Matthew Paris (d. c. 1259) said that its use by Henry III in 1257 'threatened the total extermination of Wales', and William Rishanger (d. after 1312) said it was 'a royal banner that portends a sentence of death'. The confusion may arise because the kings often intended it more as a threat than a promise. Edward III only raised the banner at Crecy after the French first unfurled the Oriflamme (which had similar connections with signifying no quarter would be given). Henry III's 1245 campaign ended with a treaty and the 1257 expedition was delayed.I wrote a [short piece about this for a Scottish newspaper just last week](_URL_0_), which has a bit more detail on the dragon's various appearances in the record.Sources:*Calendar of the Close Rolls preserved in the Public Record Office*, 47 vols (London, 1892-1963), Henry III 1242-47Rory Cox, \u2018A Law of War?

No, we have absolutely nothing even remotely resembling statistics, and just because in the past century or several there's been a noticeable increase in myopia doesn't itself say anything about medieval western Europe (what I'll be talking about here). However, medieval popular Christianity relied on *visuality* in some pretty basic ways I'm not sure it would have if 50% of some such of people couldn't see their own shoes. \"Art is the book of the illiterate\" was a basic philosophy of religious instruction. Church sculpture, mosaic, decorated rood screens, stained glass were meant to glorify God but also to instruct (hence the popularity of Last Judgment scenes over the tympanum). And watching the priest consume the Eucharist (bread and wine) could substitute for the person doing it themselves--even in the case of a saint like Nicholas von Flue.But we also know that some people were indeed nearsighted, and obviously eyesight deteriorated in various ways (presbyopia/farsightedness, AMD, cataracts, etc) with ageing. I want to briefly introduce a distinction that scholars of disability and medicine make between \"impairment\" and \"disability.\" Impairment *in this sense* is used as a deviation from the normative (not from the normal! lots of things are normal); disability refers to when an impairment affects someone's functioning in the world. Here, I'm going to talk more on managing visual impairment to minimize (not necessarily eliminate) disability.This being the Middle Ages, obviously the first way people tried to cope was by praying for miracles. And indeed, miracle stories attached to saints and shrines offer some really interesting cases of the extreme end of visual impairment that's \"not quite blindness,\" although we should keep in mind that \"blind\" is a subjective term that means different things in different contexts.Two important themes that arise from miracle stories are the effect on mobility and on ability to work. One of St. Elisabeth of Hungary's miracles concerns a girl who, it's clear, has some vision but only a little; the story emphasizes that she can't even see well enough to find her way on a path. (Medieval \"roads\" could just be a trampled line through fields). There's a similar miracle concerning a middle-aged man who developed possibly cataracts (*macula*, stains) and similarly couldn't find his way on a path; he reported being ridiculed for it. In these cases, the key was to lean on the support of other people. We read a lot about blind and otherwise visually impaired people being \"led\" to shrines. That's probably the single most common theme in anecdotes of people with disabilities in the Middle Ages--the ad hoc, case-by-case reliance on friends and family, or in a few cases monastic charity.With respect to work, it seems that in a lot of cases the key was to find a task a person could perform. The miracles of St. Bertin tell of one evidently nearsighted man who couldn't see well enough to perform outdoor manual labor, but up very close could still see well enough to do needlework. So he sat with the women of the duke's household all day, working on embroidery and weaving!The later Middle Ages did have knowledge of and practice rudimentary cataract surgery, sometimes even successfully. In 1351, aging abbot Gilles le Muisit of St. Martin's in Tournai had his cataracts removed only to find that behind them, he was farsighted: >  I saw not as in my young age but as my age demanded, because I wasalready an octogenarian, and I saw the sky, the sun, the moon, thestars, though not perfectly recognizing people, and I saw everything ata distance from me very well, but I was not able to write or read.The first \"glasses\", which were designed to be held rather than worn, were for reading (i.e. for farsightedness). [Here's a photo](_URL_0_) I took in the Dominican church museum in Eisenach of a 1510 altarpiece relief from Thuringia--the scene is the death of the Virgin Mary, and the man with the book and glasses is probably supposed to be a physician. Glasses were one type of iconographic shorthand for physicians (another being a flask filled with urine. You do you, Middle Ages.)Ronald Finucane and Irina Metzler have both pointed out that we are much less likely to read about nobles with disabling conditions. There was then as there is now a stigma attached to disability, even more so because of the stronger link between sin (moral failure) and impairment. So even in miracle stories that *do* involve knights and other nobles, the recorder will allow the healed to express a sense of shame--even to the point of feeling suicidal, in one case--a consciousness of emotion denied to lower classes. That was the case with the knight Gilbert, whose story is told in the miracle of St. Foy. *Twice in a row* he received a head injury in combat--once while, apparently, breaking up a barfight--that caused vision problems. And he was, given the source, miraculously healed in several stages. (Draw your own medical conclusions.)But one of the most interesting cases hops way above the others. Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II in the 13th century--the one who looked at the Crusades, said \"I got u, fam\" and *negotiated* his way into taking over Jerusalem from Muslim control--actually dealt with developing myopia over the course of his life. This could have been a hardship for him, as his true love was hunting. (He embarked on very few building projects over the course of his reign, but these included several hunting lodges, which is also where he preferred to spend much of his time). What did he do? He still hunted with great enthusiasm, apparently. But then, hunting in the Middle Ages wasn't about food (unless you were desperate and poaching), it was about power and masculinity and status and probably blowing off some steam. So even in the parts where humans didn't rely on their dogs and birds to do the work for them, perhaps there was not as much pressure to perform.But then, of course, there's the ultimate solution.

The only places I see it, or any version of it, it appears without any citation. I can find no version of it in a reputable academic source. Additionally, if there was evidence that Franklin had really said something as provocative as that, it would be well known. Moreover, this \"quote\" doesn't pass the smell test. The language doesn't sound like it's from the 18th century to me. That's hard to explain, but it's just an instinct. In particular, I don't think Franklin would have used the words \"We need a revolution.\" Franklin died in April 1790. The basic idea of a \"right of revolution,\" which this quote sort of draws on, was common by then. It's the idea that a free people have a right to abolish an unjust government. The U.S. Declaration of Independence uses this language: \"when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government.\" Likewise, in 1787, Jefferson wrote, \"what country can preserve it\u2019s liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? let them take arms. the remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon  &  pacify them. what signify a few lives lost in a century or two? the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots  &  tyrants. it is it\u2019s natural manure.\"But what's missing from those quotes? The word \"revolution.\" As historian Keith Baker has argued, that word didn't come to have this meaning of a systemic and collective disruption of a particular form of government until the 1790s, with the French Revolution (which the timing of Franklin's death meant that he mostly missed). Before then, \"revolution\" sometimes referred more to a rotation or change in government (like a reshuffle of the British cabinet, or the death of a monarch). In the era of the Glorious Revolution, the word \"revolution\" referred to something that happened (often with divine intervention) rather than something that human will brought about. In other words, there weren't groups that would self-consciously call themselves \"revolutionaries.\" Even in the 1780s, the \"American Revolution\" as a phrase was still developing. So the phrase \"We need a revolution\" would have been out of sync with the predominant understanding of what revolutions were until that started to change during the last few months of Franklin's life. In other words, even if this sentiment was not an uncommon one, this use of the word \"revolution\" would have been pretty unusual during Franklin's lifetime. This, in addition to the fact that I'm unable to find evidence for this quote, suggests pretty strongly that this quote is fake.

One good rule is that when popular figures from the past such as Franklin are quoted in ways that seem to speak directly to our present or which directly support one's own politics, it's worth being suspicious.

Let's run quickly through all of the various means by which the typical conduct of a duel was intended to *prevent* overly accurate fire.For the pistol itself, a smoothbore was absolutely expected. Rifling was prohibited by many dueling codes, and even if not explicitly so, it was generally understood not to be used. This didn't stop unscrupulous duelists from having specially made semi-rifled pistols where it stopped near the mouth of the barrel to avoid detection, but this was uncommon.For the arrangement of the duel, it was up to the seconds to decide almost everything. One important factor which greatly impacted likelihood of death was the distance at which to fire. 10-12 paces was common and generally acceptable. Sometimes closer distances were insisted upon, either because of the magnitude of the offense, but other reasons too, such as one duelist having poor eyesight, so insisting on it to prevent an advantage to his opponent. these close duels were considered quite murderous, and almost always resulted in injury or death, so a mindful second ought always try to prevent too short a measure.In the actual duel, aiming was thoroughly discouraged, and the rules almost always (but not in every case) decided upon meant to prevent it as much as possible. The duelists always started with their guns at rest, either pointed to the ground or directly up (even this would be greatly discussed by the seconds), and could only raise at the command. In theory, the seconds would be themselves armed and expected to shoot down the opposing duelist if they raised early! There were several ways of giving command, but the most popular ones also helped to regulate the firing. The common image of a dropping handkerchief wasn't just meant for its visual flourish. This method required both duelists to look away from their opponent and concentrate elsewhere until the last moment, both raising their weapon *and* turning their head at the same moment, and thus preventing any real opportunity to aim. Even in situations of a verbal command, the common style was to \"count off\", with the command being \"Fire-One-Two-Three-Halt!\" or similar, and both duelists *only* being allowed to raise and fire in that window. The second giving the command would generally count fairly quickly, as well.These, of course, are all institutional barriers. We also mustn't forget the less tangible factors. The nerves and jitters of the duelists could affect even the most able marksman. And it wasn't unheard of for seconds to conspire in secret to prevent bloodshed by loading a squib-measure of powder to ruin the shot - accounts of a duelist spared by a bullet bouncing off a button and relatively unharmed suggest this wasn't too uncommon even. We also need to keep in mind that not all duelists had fatal intentions. Although frowned upon by most codes, many would go to the field intending to delope their fire, essentially an acknowledgment of their having done wrong. Famously when Wellington dueled Winchelsea, the latter had an apology written up beforehand, but felt he couldn't in good conscious give it to the Duke before the duel, both for hiis own honor, as well as Wellington's right to satisfaction.Additionally though, we mustn't discount the fact that *dying* isn't the only result of a duel. Being wounded happened too! While the fatality rate for dueling ini 19th c. Britain averaged under 20 percent (Simpson found it to be 14 percent, Banks 17 percent), but the rate of people being hit was double that, with roughly 37 percent of reported duels having a death *or* injury (In smaller snapshots that goes higher. It was 43 percent from 1805 to 1824). The injury rate, also, is based only on reports of the duel, and don't reflect those who died weeks later after agonizing illness, which brings up a further point, that with the medical care of the time, almost any injury had the potential to lead to death.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The answer is that they don\u2019t.

You're right, country, blues, gospel and southern gospel artists all borrow relentlessly from each other, and that tradition goes back to the 1800's before the genres got clearly separated out (I can't speak to mariachi or norteno as I haven't studied those).  As I understand it, in the early 1900's as the recording industry was coming online, \"race\" records and \"hillbilly\" records were created as niche markets - race records selling to lower class African Americans, hillbilly records selling to lower class white Americans.  The musics sounded very similar at that point, but it was the marketing of the artists that separated them out by race.  Now whites were more than happy to listen to black music, and vice versa, but it was how they were marketed that created the initial distinction between the genres, which became country and blues, respectively, and once distinguished they became statements of identity.  Their religious counterparts, gospel and southern gospel, have a slightly different history, as they both emerged from hymns but southern gospel also was influenced by rural singing conventions.  Each of those genres borrowed from each other, but were more clearly separated even from the beginning because Sunday morning is the most segregated hour of the week in the U.S. - much less opportunity for artists to share music, although once the Pentecostal movement got going in the early 1900's, that allowed for a lot more crossover since it started out inter-racial.Why it's remained that way is simply that music is a very powerful means of creating a sense of personal and group identity.  Music, of all kinds, acts physically (resonance of sounds in the body), emotionally (connection of sounds to emotional states), and textually (in the lyrics) to reinforce particular social narratives and ways of being in the world.  Once country music was successfully labeled white by the marketing arm of the recording industry, that took on a life of it's own thanks to the racial dynamics of American culture.  It becomes a self perpetuating cycle where whiteness becomes a significant feature of country music, and vice versa, as a shortcut for distinguishing between and reinforcing the social and racial class structures.  Food, clothing, and other cultural items work much the same way.Some Sources:* Don Cusic, The Sound of Light: A History of Gospel Music* Michael Harris, The rise of gospel blues: the music of Thomas Andrew Dorsey in the urban church* Cecelia Tiichi, High lonesome: the American culture of country music* Sarah Thornton, Club cultures: music, media, and subcultural capital* Benjamin Filene, Romancing the folk: public memory  &  American roots music* James Goff, Close harmony: a history of southern gospel* Robert Darden, People Get Ready!: a history of black gospel from Africa through present", "label": 0}, {"content": "Country music has remained so white because of the industry and cultural forces that have kept the genre so completely dominated by white artists and tied to white identity.

He was sent aboard the *Mir* station as a Soviet cosmonaut 3rd Class, and, after 313 days up there, the then 34 year old flight engineer returned to Earth to a very different political structure at home than when he had left. Even his hometown, once called Leningrad when he left Earth, was upon his return now called St. Petersburg.Krikalev was actually stranded aboard *Mir* for a period. He was supposed to come home about four months earlier than he did, but due to Russian financial issues and political battling between Russia and Kazakhstan (where the former USSR's Baikonur Cosmodrome was located, as well as where the capsule touchdown location was), he was forced to stick around aboard the station for much longer than anticipated. There is a great documentary film that actually covers Krikalev's experience. It is called [*\"Out Of The Present\"*](_URL_0_). In the film, it seems that Krikalev tried to be largely unaffected by the breakup of the USSR, and instead sunk himself into focusing on the more \"mundane\" tasks of keeping the station functioning, doing repair work and some science to occupy his time between sleep/eat periods, as well as watching the Earth pass below him as he orbited our planet at 240 miles altitude every 92 minutes. At one point in the film, a Russian journalist, via radio uplink, asks Krikalev how he felt about the (political) changes on the ground and what he considers to be most impressive about them, Krikalev initially answers by offering a non-response, saying he \"did not understand the question\" (though it seems he clearly did). After being prodded further by the journalist, he finally and rather cryptically comments on how he thinks \"darkness has just turned to light\". He left himself an 'out' with that answer, as it was unknown whether he was making a political statement or rather was just referring to the fact that *Mir* had just passed through orbital sunrise at that time. ;) He then continued by saying *\"Winter has come, and before it was summer. Now, it\u2019s beginning to bloom again. That\u2019s the most impressive change you can see from space\u201d*.Keep in mind that Krikalev was sequestered away on *Mir* during the Soviet breakup, orbiting our planet 16 times a day, with Mission Control being his only real source of news (though he was allowed to talk to his wife Lena once a week or so via radio), so he faced a lot of censorship issues where he was not told the full, complete story of what was happening. He was informed of the coup attempts and breakup of his former USSR of course, but many of the political issues that affected his flight were largely kept from him or at least downplayed heavily, including the fact that the team at Mission Control had threatened to go on strike because they had not been paid in months and there was no money to pay for resupply missions or to send a replacement crew up and to bring him home. According to Sergei, his biggest personal worry while on orbit aboard *Mir* during this period was on how his family was coping with the turmoil back home. Krikalev's salary at the time was a rather paltry 500 rubles a month, so he did make comments to MCC and questioned his wife over the radio concerning how his family was managing financially. Considering the fact that the ruble's value had plummeted after the breakup, he wanted to ensure his loved ones were taken care of while he was away from Earth, which was something that was of course decidedly out of his hands and caused him considerable stress. Politically though, he recognized that he would just have to ride things out and play a game of \"hurry up and wait\" until the powers that be figured out what to do with him and the space station he occupied.  Back home, Krikalev was actually dubbed by Russian newspapers as \"The Man Who Is Sick of Flying\", and they also called him \"The Last Soviet Citizen\". It became clear he just wanted to come home as soon as was technically, financially, and politically possible. It was becoming clear to Sergei that he was being treated as an unwitting political pawn between the new Russia and Kazakhstan - as Russia relied on the Kazakh's heavily since their former Soviet space launch facilities were located there. This political issue regarding how much a new independent Kazakhstan was demanding to be paid versus how much Russia was willing to pay was serving to delay his return to Earth, as well as delaying resupply missions being sent to him aboard *Mir*, but he recognized that there was little he could do about it, other than just do his job as professionally as possible (which by all accounts he most certainly did), and sit and wait for the politicians to sort things out on Earth.  I would highly recommend you watch the documentary *\"Out Of The Present\"* if you can, as it gives a fairly decent look at the way the breakup of the USSR affected both the *Mir* program and cosmonaut Krikalev specifically. You can watch it online I believe, though I can't/won't post the direct links here, as I am unsure of the protocol/legality on that. Google is your friend though!Incidentally, Krikalev's *Mir* flight would not be his last journey to space. He later flew aboard the US space shuttle twice on missions STS-60 and STS-88, and also flew to the ISS twice as well, on Expedition #1 and Expedition #11 (in which he was station Commander, spending six months aboard). He has flown in space six times, and has a flight log cumulative total of 803 days, 9 hours, and 39 minutes in space. The dude is a real Russian \"Top Gun\" cosmonaut, and currently is the Vice-President of *RSC Energia*, which is the prime contractor for Russia's manned spaceflight program. By all accounts, he handled the news of the breakup of the USSR very professionally, with his primary focus being on ensuring the safety of his family and doing all he could from space to make sure they were not suffering too badly and had food on the table while he was away.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The cosmonauts aboard Mir were able to return to Earth in December 1991, but the space station was not decommissioned until the end of the year.

That's right--from the later 18th century, tacked-down carpet had grown more and more popular for warmth and aesthetics. Mind you, we're not talking about actual \"Oriental carpet\", but rather the cheap substitutes that had originally covered up expensive carpet in high-foot-traffic areas. This would be tacked to a wooden floor in strips across the room sewn together; or, with the advent of the broad-loom at the end of the century, maybe tacked to a wooden band around the edges of even a stone floor.Charles Locke Eastlake was having none of this.Eastlake was an architect and furniture visionary from England whose book/essay collection *Hints on Household Taste* spearheaded a new wave of interior decoration described as \"simple, real, strong, and honest\"--more austere, angled, and much less ornamented than what he considered overwrought Victorian styles. Mary Jean Smith Madigan points out that American acolytes of Eastlake tried mightily to dissociate themselves from his name even as they basically copied his aesthetic (probably because he was so well known that there was already a backlash against him!--just, not his ideas). This was particularly true of his most influential American ~~plagiarist~~ heir, *New York Times* and book author Clarence Chatham Cook. One of Cook's most important propagated principles, which he drew wholeheartedly from Eastlake, was that carpeting should absolutely not be wall-to-wall. The straight lines and square shapes created by area rugs and the visual effect of the \"clean\" space fit perfectly into the Eastlake aesthetic. Furthermore, with the ideal of hygiene and cleanliness that became so central to good solid middle class identity in the Progressive era, Eastlake, Cook, and his other disciples heavily sold the advantage of throw rugs to be taken outside and beaten clean.We have taken this apparent tangent mostly because I like words, but also because it is crucial to understand that while Eastlake style, \"Homestyle Design,\" Aestheticism, whatever you want to call it, drastically reduced the consumer premium on wall-to-wall soft floor covering, preference was ultimately preference rather than totality. Carpet retained an air of luxury, class, and abundance. Right after the deprivation years of World War I and World War II, the carpet industry in America reached its pre-1950s highs of almost 90 million square yards sold (1923 and 1948)--before falling significantly in subsequent years. In 1951, 73 million square yards of carpet were sold--in 1955, only two percent of American master bedrooms were carpeted--the carpet industry left the 1940s seriously worried for its fate.One place that was *not* worried about its economic fate at that time, on the other hand, was Dalton, Georgia. Although \"factories and manufacturing\" and \"U.S. South\" are not typically joint phrases, Dalton had made itself the exception with the cultivated evolution of its cotton mills into the tufted textile manufacturing industry. The in-home workshops of Catherine Evans Whitener and her friends, producing \"chenille\" bedspreads with some carpets on the side, caught the attention of northern investor-industrialists. They came south, where labor costs were lower, and basically turned Dalton into *the* tufted textile town. Earlier efforts at making machines to produced tufted textiles rather than hand-sewing were perfected. The northerners also brought the use of synthetic fibers as well, newly available after the war, to replace the traditional cotton and wool of the bedspreads and carpets as a cost-saving feature. (\"Every woman wants a wool carpet, but Acrilan ihas the same qualities and is cheaper,\" ran the Monsanto ads).In 1951, the tufted textile industry's presence in the carpet industry was tiny--\"carpet industry\" was synonymous with \"woven carpets.\" But the price differential was significant enough that by 1954, the American carpet industry's leaders were worried in a big way about the new competition, especially with the still-small consumer demand for carpet.So they decided to embark on a full-court press campaign to make Americans *demand* carpet: >  As the largest company in the industry, we feel it is our duty to sell the concept of carpet--the generic of carpetasserted Mohasco's Herbert Jay, vowing to \"[sell] consumers on the concept of carpet per se.\" And so the American Carpet Institute and its member companies waged a war in advertising and in government. By 1958, carpet was the #1 most-advertised household item, ahead even of television sets. \"Home Means More With Carpet On the Floor\" ran the ads' tagline. And it was not just empty words. The carpet industry lobbied the U.S. government hard to have the price of carpet included in the overall cost of the house when calculating mortgage values and rates. This made a carpeted house a more attractive financial investment. Other lines of advertisement promoted the benefits of carpet for the postwar family: \"quiet, beauty, and warmth.\" They stressed the freedom of choice--color! pattern!--even amidst the general trend in *homogenization* of household options. Carpet became a place to pretend to express individuality, argues Philip Scranton. (I am putting it less charitably than Scranton, but you get the idea).But here's the thing: American consumers are contrary, cheap, and have the attention span of a peanut.The woven carpet industry's massive ad campaign succeeded all right--by 1963, nearly 300 million square yards of carpet were sold in the US (recall: 73mil in 1951). But American consumers gave not a single care whether it was woven or tufted, wool or synthetic. They wanted what looked good, what was popular, and what was cost-effective. That meant tufted textile, which accounted for 250 million of those yards.There are certainly other factors that enabled wall-to-wall carpeting to become popular: a rise in per capita income directly correlated to an increase in carpet purchases; the wider availability and marketing as desirable of vacuum cleaners supplied the means for servant-less women to keep them clean. But we must not confuse enabling factors with causation. In the late 1950s, a massive advertising campaign for an upscale product with lingering associations of luxury attempted to save its industry from being replaced by a new, cheaper, technology-driven variant--only to sell the American public on the upstart instead, and on an utterly unprecedented scale.Further Reading:* Randall Patton, *Carpet Capital: The Rise of a New South Industry* is really all you need on the tufted textile industry and 20th century carpeting* Douglas Flamming, *Creating the Modern South: Millhands and Managers in Dalton, Georgia, 1884-1984* - from the perspective of labor history* Philip Scranton, *Endless Novelty: Specialty Production and American Industrialization, 1865-1925** Mary Jean Smith Madigan, \"The Influence of Charles Locke Eastlake on American Furniture Manufacture, 1870-90,\" *Winterthur Portfolio* 10 (1975)", "label": 0}, {"content": "In the United States, homes began to have carpet installed throughout whole rooms (as opposed to large area rugs over wooden floors) in the 1950s.

But it does have a kind of origin and explanation. I\u2019ll also add here I\u2019m mostly talking about why we call taking of land in war or other conflicts with Native American people theft and not conquest, and I\u2019m not talking as much about obvious theft or treaty violations and so on. This is about the contested term. I'm also mainly focusing on the European perspective.The many European nations in the age of exploration and beyond sometimes operated under an informal, but important, set of rules when it came to war. This set of informal rules is usually referred to as \"just war theory\" or *jus ad bellum*. A just war required a  justification for war, called a *casus belli*, a Latin phrase referring to what provoked the war. Provoke is the key word, war should be thrust upon you. A just war required a justification, and that justification couldn't just be \"because I want to,\" (though many wars were ultimately started by that), you at least had to make up a reason. A made up reason is often called a false flag, and they hold up to scrutiny to varying degrees of success. Winning helps, but isn't the ultimate decider. Ultimately, a war was supposed to be fought for a good reason. Maybe you were attacked first, so you are justified to exact revenge or retribution up to and including conquering some land from your enemy, or perhaps economically and politically crippling them and overthrowing their leaders. Even if you have justification for war, the result of the war should be relatively proportional. We still operate under these considerations. Even Hitler and Stalin had to make up reasons to invade Poland, however flimsy they were. And disproportionate retribution is still looked down upon, like the punishment inflicted on France after the Franco-Prussian war. The Prussian alliance may have had a good justification for war, but they couldn't impose any terms they desired without reason. I want to be clear I'm not making any personal value judgement here, just commenting on how people felt.So when someone talks about the United States or other colonial nations \"stealing\" land from Native American people what they are saying, probably without understanding why or the history behind just war theory, is that what these European people did to Native American people was not just. Most people don't have a problem with other Native American people conquering and displacing each other - they either had a justification for war or operated under their own theory of warfare outside European thought. But when such an overwhelming force pushes Native American nations aside and takes their land just because they want it, it *looks* like theft. So people call it theft. In many cases there was no formal declaration of war, or if there was the retribution was disproportionate. Annexing an entire nation and displacing its people is a huge deal, there is a reason it didn't happen much after the mid 1600's in Europe. It went against just war theory. And when it did happen it pissed off everyone.There are some wars between European descended people and Native Americans that seem to fall under just warfare theory. The newly formed United States of America took land from the Native American tribes who allied with the British Empire. And after the American Civil War the United States removed many of the Native American people who fought for the Confederacy. In these cases the Native American people, despite their own reasons for their actions, cast their lot in with an enemy in a just war and risked everything. Now, whether the consequences for losing were fair and justified is another matter. Many people seem to think the consequences were disproportionate. After all, the Confederate people who started the war and did 99% of the fighting were not stripped of their property and removed to Oklahoma and so on. It was just the Native Americans, so even though the war may have been just the consequences don't feel just, or feel like conquest. They feel like theft at worst or disproportionate at best. The Mexican-American war was sometimes referred to as theft because of the disproportionate land-grab that took place. U.S. Grant said *\"I was bitterly opposed to [the annexation of Mexico], and to this day, regard the war, which resulted, as one of the most* ***unjust*** *ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation. It was an instance of a republic following the bad example of European monarchies, in not considering* ***justice*** *in their desire to acquire additional territory.\"* Emphasis mine.But outside these wars a lot of the interaction between Native Americans and Europeans and their colonies came down to colonists taking land from Native Americans simply because they wanted it and it was there. Pretty theft-y feeling to me. There was no other justification for taking the land, so it looks like theft, not conquest. And most of the justifications for the taking are paper thin and were just a pretext for what they were going to do anyway. Even if they did take it by force or if there was a war, like the Seminole Wars, it lacks the *feeling* of conquest and the consequences are still disproportionate. In a number of cases the law of the United States said that taking land from certain Native American people was illegal, but the states or the army did it anyway. So people often call it theft. Whether or not it is actually theft is a legal question I suppose. Even \"justified\" conquest is probably legal theft, its just theft we feel ok with. Its also worth adding that our own ideas on what is just or not has changed since that land was taken, and to get a full understanding it is worth reading more. For a bit of historic reading on war theory I recommend: - Carl von Clauswitz: *On War* - Francis Lieber: *Code for the Government of Armies in the Field* - Dwight Eisenhower: *On the War*From some more modern academic authors: - Michael Walzer: *Just and Unjust Wars*  - Richard Norman: *Ethics, Killing, and War* - Elizabeth Anscombe article \"War and Murder\" I will add that post-9/11 thought on ethics in warfare has changed rapidly and is beyond my reading.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The term \"steal\" is used because the land was taken from the Indians without their consent.

Many consider him to be the best president we've ever had, due in no small part to his guiding the country through the most important event in American history (maybe the entirety of it, but definitely since the Revolution): the Civil War. No topic has been poured over by American historians as much as the Civil War, and it's impossible to discuss without including Lincoln's assassination. Add in the fact that he was killed by John Wilkes Booth, one of the most recognized actors of the day (imagine the media frenzy if Obama were assassinated by Tom Cruise) and you have an extra layer of fascination and weirdness. But with the backdrop of the Civil War and Lincoln's death helping to shape the next 30 years of American policy, it's easy to see why people can't get enough of that tragic story.Kennedy's assassination is so fascinating for a number of reasons, chief among them that it happened in the modern era. While historians have nothing to go on with the Lincoln/Garfield/McKinley assassinations but artists renderings and eyewitness accounts, Kennedy's assassination was caught on tape. Nearly everyone has seen the footage at some point. Then we have the conspiracy factor where no one is exactly sure what happened, how Oswald was himself killed before he could testify or provide any real clues, how a number of people had an axe to grind with Kennedy (from the mafia to Castro to maybe LBJ himself), etc. and you're left with quite the unsolved mystery. Also much like Lincoln, Kennedy's sudden death played an enormous role in shaping American policy and who would follow him as commander in chief over the next 20 years or so.The assassinations of Garfield and McKinley, however, lack these kinds of backdrops that would give them relevance in popular culture like the deaths of Lincoln and Kennedy. It's not exactly fair to say they died during a \"lull\" in American history (1870-1915 or so, between the Civil and Great War), but they weren't killed with enormous backdrops behind them like the conclusion of the Civil War, or right between the Cuban Missile Crisis and early intervention into Vietnam. There's no juicy mystery/possible conspiracy into the deaths of Garfield or McKinley like we have with Kennedy, nor is there hours of photo or video evidence to dive into. And it's also much harder to argue that the sudden loss of Garfield or McKinley sharply changed American history - Lincoln's untimely demise greatly affected Reconstruction, and Kennedy's death greatly affected how we entered Vietnam and also tackled domestic issues like civil rights and LBJ's Great Society efforts. You'll have a much harder time arguing that Garfield or McKinley's assassinations created new circumstances that would not have happened otherwise (for example, McKinley's death opened the door for Teddy Roosevelt to become president, but he was such a force of personality that it may well have happened anyway with subsequent events remaining largely unchanged).TL;DR - we discuss Lincoln's death so much because he was so important to American history. We discuss Kennedy's assassination so much because people love conspiracies and because it happened so recently with tons of video evidence to examine. Meanwhile, the deaths of Garfield/McKinley did not sharply affect American history in the way that Lincoln/Kennedy did, and they presided over less \"exciting\" times, so they unfortunately are more likely to be left in history's dustbin.", "label": 0}, {"content": "James A.

[One study](_URL_1_) found the average American soldier in 1860 was 5'7\" tall (170.6 cm). That's an inch or two taller than major European countries \u2014 the British and Dutch averaged around 5 feet and 5.5 inches; the French were shorter still. [Another study](_URL_0_) looking solely at American soldiers similarly found the average male soldier in 1864 was just over 5'7\" tall; the average soldier in World War II was 5'8.4\" tall, just over an inch higher. Studies looking at 19th Century male height almost exclusively look at soldiers, because that was often the only consistent way of collecting data. But these data should be looked at carefully \u2014 because European armies, at least, usually had minimum height requirements for soldiers, and surprisingly large numbers of European conscripts flunked that test. Looking at France, my specialty, in the 1820s \"about a quarter of boys liable for conscription were refused as being below the minimum height to handle a musket (only just over 5 feet),\" per historian Robert Tombs. The shortest, most malnourished soldiers came not from the teeming large cities but from the poorest rural areas. Eugen Weber gives some specific examples from the department of Lot in southwestern France; in one district, the 1830 draft class consisted of 1,051 draftees, of which 212 (one-fifth) were rejected. Of those, the cited reason was stuntedness (*d\u00e9faut de taille*) for 120. Consistently, Weber notes, up to half of all people rejected for military service were rejected for shortness. (Many of the others had various physical deformities or ailments, which are also associated with malnourishment. \"In 1860 one rural area near Grenoble had this to show to the army recruiters: goiter, 140; deaf or dumb, 13; lame, 13; myopia, 36; tapeworm, 19; scabies, 1; skin maladies, 86; scrofula, 15; epilepsy, 2; general weakness, 197; hunchback, 29; bone distortion, 2. In a total of 1,000, 553 men were disqualified, only 447 found fit for service.\") Alain Corbin's case study of a 19th Century French peasant (born 1798, died 1876) notes that he was 5'5\" tall and that \"for this time and place, in other words, he was a tall man.\" One 1849 discussion of \"men remarkable by their height\" to serve in elite French units \"makes clear that they are between 5'6\" and 5'8\" tall,\" Weber writes. These elite, unusually tall French soldiers would have been average or even short in the Union Army!By 1860, the situation in France had improved somewhat \u2014 Emile Durkheim found \"the number of conscripts rejected for height dropped from 92.8 per 1,000 in 1831 to 59.4 per 1,000 in 1860,\" but that's still more than 1 in 20 men being less than around 5' tall. [Today](_URL_2_) 1 in 297 adult Frenchmen would fail that test. (This reflects improvements in agriculture and transportation during the 1850s.) Even the soldiers who were healthy enough to be admitted into the army often required \"a few months of solid regular feeding, including 340 grams of meat a day, before they could cope with the physical demands of service.\"Unlike in Europe, the Union Army didn't have codified height minimums, but rather a subjective judgment by an examining doctor. One American officer summarized the situation in 1875:  >  Weight is not a regulated quality in any code of laws governing the enlistment of recruits. The circumference of chest thought to be indispensable as an accompaniment to certain degrees of stature, is carefully laid down in the English regulations, but weight is not even mentioned. It is presumed that the matter is left to the discretion of the examining surgeon, with whom the decision as to the other qualities named might, it is thought, be also left with advantage. A due proportion in the weight is quite as essential in the soldier as a well-formed chest, and is of greater importance than lofty stature. In former times, when it was necessary to make use of a ramrod in loading a musket, men of a certain height were absolutely necessary for the service; but in these days of breech-loading arms, a man from 5 feet to 5 feet 4 inches in stature, and well proportioned in build and weight is, ceteris paribus, as serviceable a soldier as can be desired.Americans were shorter then than they are now, but if you're comparing them to other Western countries, Union soldiers were remarkable not for being short but for being tall.EDIT: I've seen nearly half a dozen replies now asking questions about my use of inches and feet. To preempt more: Those are standard, modern inches and feet. In most cases the raw height data was given in centimeters and I translated it into modern feet and inches because the question was asked using those units. No, the differences here are not explained by the confusion about different units called the \"foot\" that is commonly cited as a reason for the (largely false) belief in Napoleon's shortness.

The war against Great Britain has been a *pursuit of seven long years*. You're likely to have served one or more full terms of service; you've poured blood and sweat into the soil of what you hope someday to be a country of its own. You've toed the line against British regulars, endured winter hardships and summer shortages. You've marched up and down the coast often without shoes or a good coat. You've aged. Your family has aged. You've lost friends and have shared a tent with disease and famine. Death is your oldest marching companion. You like to believe that you've done this with a kind *suffering courage,* without word of complaint or notion of disobedience.

You have indebted yourself and your family, even while in service, and promised pay is *months* in arrears, if not years. *Another step would ruin you forever.*The congress and other elites seem to treat these issues with *coldness and severity.* In the absence of pay, at the very least, you could be offered a small amount of *gratitude.*In camp, with little to do as the war winds down, you find that these harbored grievances are shared by a number of other soldiers, and amazingly, they are shared even by officers! Not only that, but some seem to argue that the continued wordless forbearance would be an irredeemable mark of shame. That bearing these burdens would be proof that *you richly deserve the chains you broke* when you volunteered to serve. These officers are encouraging action as demonstration of the *gallantry* which won a country.What was the war if not a fight against tyranny? What kind of soldiers would exchange one collar for another? Tyranny can and will wear *the plain coat of republicanism* as well as the *splendid robe of royalty*, and one must know to recognize it in all its disguises. What was the worth of all of this toil, this backbreaking labor for liberty, if the result is to *starve and be forgotten?*What do you ask for now but justice? Gratitude and a place in posterity, elbow to elbow in history as on the field of battle?______________________________________This could have been the emotional state of a great many men in 1783. The war *had* been long, and shockingly brutal in some phases and in some places. Congress had had a bear of a time paying for anything, and those men who made an earnest effort to pay and support the army, understanding the grim need to keep soldiers fed, fit, and motivated - like John Adams - are often eclipsed by those who find that the army can support itself while they concentrate on other matters.Officers especially felt the pinch. Or, at least, we know that quite a few did as they're the ones who left the record. In March of 1783, a letter began circulating the camp at Newburgh, New York, articulating the concerns imagined above (all quotes *in italics* are taken directly or paraphrased from the first letter). Partly prompted by the failure of congress to regularly pay them or their men, the waffling over the question of pensions for officers, many of whom have served faithfully for *years* now, and the stoppages of pay with the promise of being made up later are starting to fall on deaf ears.A number of highly regarded men cosign, or at least support, this letter. With the benefit of the historical gaze we know that the author was likely John Armstrong, Jr. (who would be appointed Secretary of War during the War of 1812). Henry Knox (another future SecWar) was also prominent in debates and public statements of support for fair pay and for post-war pensions. There was, in short, a great deal of unrest among very prominent men.The letter was of particular concern to Washington. Initially, he thought that the letter was a work of conspirators outside of camp, which was a fear that he and other federalists would later echo during times of public crisis: the poles of politics of that era were the anarchy of \"the mob\" and the tyranny of centralized power. The danger or reality of both was at times greatly exaggerated, but nevertheless there are numerous examples of federal overreach or dangerous mob actions.To a man like Washington, this had the potential of spinning the republic out of control. A letter like this was just the kind of demonstrative sedition that could cause a general mutiny that could only be corrected through bloodshed.Washington quickly moved to quash this insubordination, and called for a meeting. [**see /u/MrGrumpyBear's correction below**]______________________________________Now put yourself into Washington's shoes. He has shirked no discomfort, made no complaint, expected his men endure no hardship that he himself was not willing to cheerfully share. He *has never left their side one moment* He has suffered the stabbing cold at Valley Forge, and worse winters besides; he has smelled the powder smoke and staunched the blood of battle; he has suffered insult and indignity in the press, has laid his reputation, future, property, and life on the line no less than any man of the line. He considers his *own military reputation as inseparably connected with that of the army*.Through it all, his genius has not been to spank the British up and down the coast, it has been to keep the army whole through hardship and embarrassment and reversal. At the end of the first terrible campaign season, when his army threatened to splinter into oblivion before his eyes, he kept a core together through a harsh, starving winter. He has prevented mass desertions after entire seasons of retreat, retreat, retreat, eking out his victories by blunt force of character, rather than subtlety of tactics or elegance of maneuver.That his army would melt away not from British grapeshot, but from internal politicking, at the eve of victory, was utterly unthinkable. *How subversive of all order and discipline*. He writes a reply, written with the same kind of *great art* that was evident in the anonymous circulation, that advises honor, dignity, and patience, all virtues previously shown by the army in all of their shared privations, for is this army not *celebrated thro' all Europe for its fortitude and patriotism?*But what alternative is proposed by this *insidious foe* who drafted the letter? For he must be a foe, for who but a foe would council *turning our arms against our country in the extremest hour of her distress*? He cautions mere reflection; and on reflection, the repudiation of the ends sought by malefactors. >  By thus determining \u2014  &  thus acting, you will pursue the plain  &  direct road to the attainment of your wishes. You will defeat the insidious designs of our enemies, who are compelled to resort from open force to secret artifice. You will give one more distinguished proof of unexampled patriotism  &  patient virtue, rising superior to the pressure of the most complicated sufferings; \u2014 And you will, by the dignity of your conduct, afford occasion for posterity to say, when speaking of the glorious example you have exhibited to mankind, had this day been wanting, the world has never seen the last stage of perfection to which human nature is capable of attaining._________________________________________________As Washington finished his address, he was unsure what effect, if any, it had had on the assembled officers. To prove that measures were being taken to address the grievances brought up by the letter, even as irregular and improper they were, he produced a letter from Joseph Jones, a colleague in congress, outlining proposals in support of the army.Jones wrote, apparently, with a neat, tight hand, and Washington's vision had begun to fail.___________________________________________________As you watch Washington give the address, he must have been every inch the *general* of your experience. A large, imposing man, not often given to displays of passion, had just fired volleys of condemnation upon the secret architects of the original letter. It was true that Washington had been the tentpole of the army, a reliable figure in and out of camp. Tireless and a legendary even before the war had ended.What do you feel now? Shame? Perhaps. A certain reluctance to fully engage in what before had seemed so clear and close - you *do* deserve recognition, gratitude, and support, but to take it by force? Was that ever a real possibility?As Washington ends the speech, he pulls out a letter. And suddenly that tireless engine that drove the continental army to victory against the greatest army on earth looks *tired.* Old. Worn.He squints at the letter. Looks up at the assembled men, almost sheepishly, and pulls out a pair of spectacles. Raising them to his nose, he says, quietly, \"Gentleman, you must pardon me, for I have not only grown gray but almost blind in service to my country.\"**Continued below**", "label": 0}, {"content": "George Washington was a general in the American Revolutionary War.

However, he did not become a pessimist until well after the British fleet sunk its counterpart. It was the Siege at Acre and the outbreak of plague that forced Napoleon back from a conquest of Syria and Turkey. There are many good books written on the French left in Egypt, including one by Strathern. The army largely suffered as soon as it landed in a climate that was too hot, dry, and hostile for the French to adequately deal with. The army came well-prepared to win a set piece battle and feed itself. What the army lacked however were large numbers of cavalry, especially light cavalry essential for reconnaissance and requisitioning the countryside. **The French tried to make the climate less hostile thru cotton and paper.** Napoleon applied his best efforts to win the 'hearts and minds' of the citizenry in Cairo, which included tens of thousands of pamphlets and other paper proclamations (invariably claiming Napoleon was actually there by invitation from the Ottoman Sultan who took pity on his people oppressed by the usurping Mamelukes). His successor by contrast did one even better, converting to Islam and 'going native'. But French efforts to become popular in the land they just conquered were tone deaf, inhibited by language and religious differences which led to peasant revolts mirroring the vast rebellion in Cairo that Napoleon had brutally suppressed before. **Once Napoleon left, things got weird.** The British fleet, Sir Sydney, various Mameluke Beys, and the Ottoman military never gave up harassing and attacking the French in Egypt. There are reports of plague and famine, hunger and atrocities. It is a testament to the high-quality of the French army that with and without Napoleon, it generally won any set piece battles against either Egyptian peasant, Mameluke or Turk. However, when the British landed a large expeditionary force of European Neapolitans and redcoats, I think the French finally realized they were truly cut off from the homeland. There was no breakout attempt; just a tame surrender. **The survivors were repatriated to France** at the end of the War of the Second Coalition. Surprisingly enough, there was less animosity against Napoleon for his desertion than you would think, likely due to his control over the presses and his ability to link his coup and French European successes as integral to the repatriation of the Egyptian expedition. But Napoleon also sent many of the soldiers back on another colonial misadventure, this time to Haiti where many of the soldiers died of Yellow Fever (which incidentally only arose from Africa in the 18th CE, which explains why Cortez and Pizarro succeeded where the French later failed).

Moreover, the monarchy sometimes had need of children, and then it skimmed the street... > Under Louis XV, children disappeared in Paris; the police carried them off \u2013 nobody knows for what mysterious use. People whispered with affright horrible conjectures about the purple baths of the king. Barbier speaks ingenuously of these things. It sometimes happened that the officers running short of children, took some who had fathers. The fathers, in despair, rushed upon the officers. In such cases, the parlement interfered and hung \u2013 whom? The officers? No; the fathers.\"Hugo is referring here to rumours that abounded during the reign of Louis XV (1715-1774) that the monarch suffered from leprosy, and his source is the lawyer Edmund Barbier's diaries, published in Paris as the *Chronique de la r\u00e9gence et du r\u00e8gne de Louis XV (1718\u20131763)* in eight volumes in 1857. According to Barbier, writing on 16 May 1750, > \"For a week now people have been saying that police constables in disguise are roaming around various quarters of Paris, abducting children, boys and girls from five or six years old to ten or more, and loading them into the carriages which they have ready waiting nearby.\"Barbier added that it was generally believed that these agents of the monarchy worked on behalf of > \"a leprous prince whose cure required a bath in human blood, and there being no blood purer than that of children, these were seized so as to be bled from all their limbs.\"Jones notes that while these rumours did not specifically identify which member of the Bourbon line was leprous, \"in accounts which circulated widely at court and which reached the ears of the king himself, that leprous prince was metamorphosed into the morally and spiritually unclean and sexually debauched Louis XV\", leading the king to complain that \"the wicked people... are calling me a Herod.\"The widespread belief of this rumour led in 1750 to serious rioting in six districts of Paris, the proximate cause of which was a police drive to sweep the streets of vagrant children. This drive had its roots in an instruction issued late in 1749 by the Lieutenant General [commander] of the Paris police, Nicolas-Ren\u00e9 Berryer (1703-62) \u2013 a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Louis XV's mistress the Marquise de Pompadour, but also an innovative officer who is generally credited with both the creation of the S\u00fbret\u00e9 [\"Security Office\"] and a domestic espionage system based on networks of police spies. Berryer ordered that > \"all beggars and vagrants found in the streets of Paris\u2026of whatever age or sex, shall be arrested and taken to prison, there to be detained for as long as shall be deemed necessary.\"In practice, however, it proved much easier to catch children than adult vagrants, and since the Paris police were being rewarded on the basis of the number of \"beggars\" they could arrest, they detained a disproportionate number of youngsters - enough for the locals to assume that the round-up was being specifically directed against them. Berryer then further compounded matters by issuing another order for the detention of \"all children of workers and bourgeois alike caught gambling in the squares and market places along with other little rascals and vagabonds.\" This guaranteed that at least some of those arrested had parents and other relatives on hand to protest the new policies \u2013 hence the outbreak of disorder.It was widely assumed that the children caught up in this drive were not merely being relocated or imprisoned, but that they were actually being arrested in order to be supplied to the Bourbon court, and according to one police report, a spy haunting a tavern near the Place des Victoires heard a local woman claim that they would have their revenge for these atrocities: \"Our women of Les Halles will go to Versailles to dethrone the King and tear his eyes out.\" At least 20 people were killed during the rioting, and three of those involved were arrested and hanged for public order offences. Intriguingly, the police (apparently seeking to distract attention from their own heavy-handedness) were responsible for the unleashing of another rumour \u2013 that the riots had been provoked by mysterious \"men in black\" who worked their way through the crowds assembling on Paris's streets, and offered money to those willing to start trouble. **Sources**Arlette Farge  &  Jacques Revel, *The Vanishing Children of Paris: Rumor and Politics before the French Revolution* (1993)Victor Hugo, *[Les Mis\u00e9rables](_URL_0_)*Colin Jones, *The Great Nation: France from Louis XV to Napoleon* (2003)Alan Williams, *The Police of Paris, 1718-1789* (1979)", "label": 0}, {"content": "The 'purple baths' were a nickname for the baths at the Palace of Versailles, where Louis XV was a frequent visitor.

Most of the telling put her in the state of Northern Wei, during the Northern and Southern Era between 420 and 589 CE. As the name suggests, this was a period of disunion for the Chinese empire, falling in between the collapse of the Han c. 220 CE, and the formal reunification of the imperium under the Sui c. 589.Northern Wei was, like virtually the whole of China northern of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, under the political and military control of non-Chinese people, collectively known as Turks. And when I say \u201cTurks\u201d, don\u2019t start thinking of Istanbul and kebabs, these are in virtually every respect the analogue to what the Mongols under Genghis Khan would become 8 centuries later: a powerful confederation of central Asian steppe-riders. Northern Wei in particular was dominated by a subset called the Tuoba Xianbei, which had seized the throne of the largest territory in the north by successfully rebelling against its overlord state, Later Yan, in 399 and their clan leader enthroning himself as Emperor Daowu.So that puts us in a time and place, let\u2019s get to your question: how did military conscription take place in such a society?It\u2019s worth pointing out that, were we talking about a \u201creal\u201d Chinese dynasty \u2013 one controlled and run by the ethnic Han people \u2013 Like Han, Tang, or Song\u2026 we\u2019d have a very different answer to this \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t have conscripted; they\u2019d have outsourced their military issues to other border \u201cbarbarians\u201d to play them off of their own neighbors. But no, in this time and place \u2013 with both the north and the south embroiled in conflicts lasting centuries \u2013 conscription was a very real and necessary thing. The *Ballad of Mulan* makes this very clear:  >  \u53ef\u6c57\u5927\u70b9\u5175\u3002\u519b\u4e66\u5341\u4e8c\u5377\uff0c\u5377\u5377\u6709\u7237\u540d\u3002\u963f\u7237\u65e0\u5927\u513f\uff0c\u6728\u5170\u65e0\u957f\u5144\u3002\u613f\u4e3a\u5e02\u978d\u9a6c\uff0c\u4ece\u6b64\u66ff\u7237\u5f81\u3002 >  trans: The Khan is calling many troops.

I want to buy a saddle and horse, And serve in the army in Father\u2019s place.\u201dHere already, though, we see the fictive license taken with this poem: this sort of personalization \u2013 individual names slated \u2013 would\u2019ve been completely untenable, at least at the level of the khan/emperor. There would\u2019ve just been far too much paperwork for that sort of thing, and far too expensive\u2026 throughout virtually the entire span of Chinese  imperial history, the central government itself could not manage anything below the county-level. Thus, authority had to be devolved to the local level. This had been done for centuries via the *chaiyi fa*, the \u201cdraft service system.\u201d Villages were assigned as groups of households, most typically as a unit of 110 households called a *li*. The *li* was then further subdivided into eleven units of 10 households called *jia*, according to their tax-brackets \u2013 high, middle, or low. Of those 11 *jia*, the richest was assigned by the census-taker each decade as the \u201cadministrative\u201d *jia*, and each household took a 1-year shift as head of the li. From the remaining 10 *jia*, they\u2019d likewise take one-year-long shifts as the \u201clevy labor unit\u201d for their *li*. From Ray Huang: \u201cUnder the direction of the *li* chief of the year, it performed the local tax collection and delivery, and met all material and labor requisitions on behalf of the entire *li*. The other units paid their regular taxes, but were not liable to service obligations that year. Thus in a decennial period all households took a one-year turn at discharging their service obligations. After the ten-year cycle a new census was taken and all *lijia* were re- organized in accordance with the changes that had occurred during the decade. With certain variations, the wards and precincts in the cities were organized along similar lines.\u201dServices rendered by the *jia* called up for their year-long spate of duties could expect to perform tasks for the government such as providing office attendants for the administration, from the county all the way up to the imperial government... in role as varied as doormen, guards, messengers, litter-bearer, cooks, buglers, boatmen, patrolmen, jailers, stable grooms, receiving men in warehouses, operators of canal watergates, and clerical assistants. As mentioned, this wasn\u2019t necessarily confined to one\u2019s home region, but instead wherever the government deemed a vacancy needed to be filled. This same kind of locally-based conscription rotation was in effect for the military, as well. And while what I\u2019m directly pulling from here in this next part actually occurred in the 11th century during the Northern Song, it was heavily inspired by and meant to emulate the conscription practices of the Period of Disunion. It was laid out as followed: in every locality, a group of households \u2013 first 10, but later reduced to 5 \u2013 were organized into a \u201csmall guard unit\u201d, from which two mature males (or more depending on extenuating circumstances) could be called up for active duty. A level higher than that, the process largely repeated, with these small guards organized by 5s into \u201clarge guards\u201d headed by the wealthiest landowner from among them. A level up, and again the large guards were groups by 5s into a single Superior Guard, headed by the two wealthiest landowners. All other households in the area not eligible for service as guardsmen \u2013 those unlanded peasants and urbanites \u2013 were considered to be eligible to be called upon as auxiliaries to the guard corps. Guardsmen and auxiliaries alike were permitted to train with bow and arrow, as well as any weapon not specifically forbidden by law. Probably the most significant difference between the *baojia* and the older security systems, though, was that service was compulsory rather than voluntary \u2013 and to keep track of who had supplied what in terms of manpower, each unit was required to write up and maintain a list of each household in their region and who was expected to report for duty when called upon. These local militias\u2019 duties ran the gamut of what you\u2019d expect: nightly patrols of their township, pursuit of thieves, and informing on bandits, murderers, arsonists, rapists, and cultists to government higher-ups, as well as those suspecting of harboring them.So, all of this to say that, *had* Hua Mulan been a real person, her father wouldn\u2019t have been summoned to don his family armor and march out with a bum leg to the frontlines \u2013 and certainly not by some faraway faceless imperial decree. It would have been done on the level of the township, by families and individuals who had lived together their whole lives. They would have *known* Father Hua was crippled and had no adult sons, and they would have ensured that he and his family were, when their rotation to \u201cactive duty\u201d within the *lijia* system came up, shunted off into other, more suitable and equally useful positions within the bureaucratic system\u2026 anything from doorman, to groom, to jailer. Mulan wasn\u2019t saving her father from anything like death on the front lines \u2013 the girl just wanted to fight._________Frankel, Han H. *The Flowering Plum and the Palace Lady: Interpretations of Chinese Poetry.*  Huang, Ray. *Taxation and Governmental Finance in Sixteenth Century Ming China.*  Smith, Paul Jakov. \u201cShen-tsung\u2019s Reign and the New Policies of Wang An-shih, 1067\u20131085\u201d in *The Cambridge History of China, vol. 5: The Sung Dynasty and its Precursors.*  Standen, Naomi. \u201cThe Five Dynasties\u201d in *The Cambridge History of China, vol. 5: The Sung Dynasty and its Precursors.*", "label": 0}, {"content": "In the movie Mulan, Mulan's dad is supposed to be inscripted into the army despite having an obvious disability from a previous military combat.

(Literally, The State Bank.)  Gosbank was an interesting entity that evolved from the Tsarist Russia\u2019s State Bank in that it was a central bank owned and operated by the government, so the transition to Soviet control was not as jarring as you might think. Tsarist Russian had private banks as well, but the State Bank was used in a manner to improve the Russian economy by loaning money at low rates to industrialists and facilitating foreign investment in Russia, as well as providing support to the landed class and industrialists by providing modern banking practices and facilities. The concept of a bank was part and parcel of many Russian revolutionaries thinking, Lenin himself was in favor of a single banking entity. For them a singe banking entity was to be fully integrated into the centrally planned economy of the Soviet Union by becoming part of the government apparatus and assisting in controlling the economy in providing a stable currency and foreign exchange. The bank would be essential to help keep an accounting of production and distribution of goods, providing the infrastructure needed to create a socialist society. With a central bank, you could determine someones ability/contribution, and pay out to their need, as it were. Now, after the Revolution and Civil War, the existing state bank collapsed and the modern Gosbank did not arise until the beginings of the 1930\u2019s.  It was then joined by Sperbank (\"Savings Bank\"), the sole bank for household savings deposits, which earned a positive but very low rate of interest, Stroibank (\"Investment Bank\"), was responsible for disbursing funds to enterprises for long-term investment, according to the dictates of the central plan and the Vneshtorgbank (\"Foreign Trade Bank\") which handled all transactions involving imports and exports.Gosbank operated on what can be called a \u201cbookkeeping system\u201d.  Whenever one state enterprise shipped its goods to another state enterprise, the Gosbank account of the \"output-enterprise\" would be credited, while that of the \"input-enterprise\" would be debited.For ordinary workers, there was cash, which was used for only two purposes. First, the state industries paid their workers with cash provided by Gosbank (the account of the state enterprise would be debited), then workers purchased goods with cash, which was then turned over to Gosbank (the account of the store would be credited). Here is an example by Marc Liberman to show how this would work in practice: *When farm delivered its milk output, it would obtain a document from the cheese factory verifying that the latter had received its milk input. The document was then turned over to Gosbank, which credited the farm's account according to the value of the milk delivered, and debited the cheese factory's account by the same value. Likewise, after the cheese was produced and shipped to the State food store, the cheese factory obtained a document verifying its delivery of cheese. Again, the document was turned over to Gosbank, which this time credited the cheese factory's account and debited the store's account. Finally, when households purchased the cheese with cash, the State store deposited its cash receipts with Gosbank and was given a credit of equal value.*  As you can see, banking was an important part of keeping track of the production and consumption of a planned economy, every transfer of physical output from one location to another was mirrored by an associated financial transfer through Gosbank. If less than the planned amount was delivered on any given day, Gosbank would know. If delivery were late, Gosbank would know. If inputs or outputs were stolen and diverted to the black market, Gosbank would know . (Well, maybe Gosbank would know\u2026) This type of control was needed for a planned economy, as a result inter-enterprise credit was simply not allowed; one enterprise could not \"lend\" bookkeeping money to another by permitting late payment for goods received. Also, enterprise accounts with Gosbank could only be used to pay for **the type and quantities of inputs that were specified in the plan**. Otherwise, Gosbank would refuse to release the credits. This control was designed to prevent deviations from the central production plan. But since the plan itself was often inconsistent, providing an enterprise with too little of one input and too much of another, managers in order to meet their output requirements were forced to develop sources of supply that could bypass Gosbank, sources that required neither bookkeeping money nor cash. Hence, the extraordinary adaptive and enterprising Soviet productions managers engaged in an immense amount of interfirm bartering. An enterprise with excess coal might be lucky enough to trade it for some desperately needed steel. More likely, it would trade its excess coal for some rubber that it didn't need, and would then go about finding an enterprise that had excess steel but needed rubber. Or, worse still: it would trade coal for rubber, then trade rubber for steel knives, and finally melt down the knives to obtain raw steel.As a side note as to cash, state enterprises were forbidden to hold it for any purpose other than payment of wages, the cash receipts collected by State stores had to be deposited with Gosbank, and then withdrawn again to pay the wages of the store workers. The whole process of banking basically worked like this: State Bank \u2013 payments to State enterprises \u2013 payment to workers \u2013 payment for retail sales and services \u2013 State Bank.  As for imports and exports, all goods produced for export were \"sold\" to Vneshtorgbank, which credited the producer's account with bookkeeping money. Vneshtorgbank would then sell the goods abroad for foreign currency. In turn, the foreign currency was used to pay for imports into the Soviet Union, which were then sold to a Soviet enterprise whose bookkeeping monies would be debited.  The authorities could as a result carefully monitor foreign currency exchange, and ensure that scarce \"hard currency\" (i.e., freely convertible currency like U.S. dollars or German marks) was used only for \"desired purposes.\"Now, Stroibank the state bank for financing the capital investments made by enterprises and organizations, basically any industry or state enterprise for construction outlays, expansion, etc.   Stroibank grants these credits/loans/money to state enterprises, within in central planning limits, for the reserving of material assets and for outlays on construction.  State enterprises and new construction projects are authorized to place orders on these credits allowing them to increase their allotment and outlay of equipment and materials. Storibank did loan money to individuals for residential construction. So basically as a borrower you would be debited for the new equipment/work beyond your normally allowed allotment and the State enterprise doing the work would be credited. So you would have to go to the bank with  list of all the things you needed to expand or build your project, the bank would review, and if approved you would not be given money, but would be given the opportunity to requisistion the apporpirate goods and servces needed. Individuals generally could not get a loan, some were allowed in the early days of the first Five Year Plans to acquire farming equipment, seed, maybe housing and such through Selkhozbank (Agricultural Bank) which was basically a Storibank for farming.  However,  the State Bank would at times issue things similar to loans in order to reduce the rate of savings and to increase production or reduce surplus goods, for example flat out subsidies for durable goods or long term repayment of credits awarded.*The Development of the Soviet Economic System*, Alexander Baykov*The Process of Investment in the Soviet Union*, David A.

They had been steamrolled by the Germans in 1940, diminishing their global prestige, then they had taken significant war damages in the subsequent Allied military and French partisan campaigns and, to top it all off, the French colonial empire had not been sitting on its butt all that time waiting for the glorious Europeans to return and govern them once again - especially the Japanese takeover in Indochina had invoked quite a violent reaction from the locals, with one particular rebel leader increasingly rising to prominence; you might have heard of him: Ho Chi Minh.So, as you might guess, France got itself involved in a bloody colonial war against the Vietnamese. Not a great idea.France very much realized that if they lost to the independence movement in Vietnam and Indochina as a whole, they would next have to fear breakaway movements in other possessions, especially in Africa.So, all France needed to do at this point was not to lose the war against the Vietnamese.And then they lost the war against the Vietnamese. The First Indochina War, lasting from late 1946 to mid 1954, ended in a four-way partition of Indochina - Cambodia, Laos and North and South Vietnam all gained independence from France as part of the Geneva Conference of 1954.Of course, the soon-to-break-out conflict between the two Vietnamese states would get the United States into the war and inflict on the Americans the only clear cut total defeat in U.S. history - in a war that we now think of when speaking of the \"Vietnam War\".But the U.S. is not our focus right now, so let's stick with France. Let's explore this \"Fourth Republic\" that you already alluded to in your question.Now, to the reader who is not as up to speed in terms of French political history: France has had one of the most government-switching internal political histories in Europe. We count five republics, two kingdoms, two empires, one fascistic puppet state and one provisional government since the 1780s.The republics that I mentioned are all quite different from each other, and France currently is in the Fifth Republic, which was established in 1958 and has been relatively successful since then. The division between the Fourth and the Fifth Republics is drawn at the new national constitution that France adopted in 1958. Note that the constitution can of course still be changed and France has done so at least 18 times since 1958 - but a complete overhaul it has not seen, which is why the current Macron government is just as much part of the Fifth Republic as its first President, De Gaulle. OP also mentioned him of course - all in due time.So the Fourth Republic. It came into being when the constitution of the country was redrafted in 1946, thus succeeding the two-year provisional government.Now, the Fourth Republic kind of fell into the Weimar Republic trap of utterly divided parliaments, making government formation rather difficult. One of those squabblers was the PCF, the Parti communiste francais. And yes, \"communiste\" translates to exactly what you think it does. So, these communists were consistently among the strongest parties in the republic, getting between 20 and 30% of the vote in each of the legislative elections of 1945, June 1946, November 1946, 1951 and 1956. If that seems like a few too many elections to you, the French people at the time very much noticed as well. Political inability to form a government really sucks, but they have since passed on that curse to their Belgian neighbors thankfully.Anyway, back to big geostrategic history. So, France had gotten its butt kicked by some unruly farmers in Indochina - rather embarassing, as you might imagine. So, when in 1956, just two years later, Egyptian President Nasser decided to nationalize the Suez Canal, France saw its chance. You see, we associate the canal with Britain nowadays because they held the majority of the stocks and were also its protectors, but initially, the canal had been built by the French. After the two countries actually became friends in the early 1900s, they had a huge interest in keeping the canal going - not only did it connect Britain to the rest of its empire, but it also provided France with a quick route to Djibouti, Polynesia and previously Indochina.So, the Suez Canal had been held in an international mandate after the end of the British rule in Egypt and after the end of the Egyptian monarchy. So when Nasser invaded, France and Britain were rather annoyed and intervened, paratroopers and all. Their third partner was Israel, which provided the ground support with infantry and tanks.The preparations for the plan had been in absolute secret and no one told the Americans, so when President Eisenhower found out, he was rather angry, and the United States became one of only two major international voices to oppose and condemn the move. The other? The Soviet Union.In your question, you also throw into the room if France was ever considered a superpower. Under Napoleon maybe, but not in the Fourth Republic. Immediately after World War II, there was a three-superpower model with the US, the UK and the USSR. After the Suez Crisis, the UK would for good lose its claim to this triumvirate and France lost all its hope to join it - because after American political intervention, the British immediately chickened out, as the occupation was already unpopular at home. Israel, deeming the situation pointless to pursue, also fell back to home court - after all, they were there to help the British and the French, and their justification vanished with the British retreat.France, on its own and abandoned in enemy territory, following suit a very bitter nation.The Suez Crisis had political implications that many readers of history don't realize: Britain and France no longer were the Sykes-Picot powers dividing the Middle East between them. They had been told off by their own ally - that ally, the United States, had at the same time proven that it was definitely more powerful than the old European powers. And Egypt? They kept the canal and they also kept playing the US and USSR off each other to their own benefit. Nasser was a clever guy like that. It would no longer be France and Britain that would defend western interests in the Middle East - it would be America.Back to France.Humiliated again. First the Nazis, then Ho Chi Minh, and now this. Whereas Britain and to a lesser extent Israel made it their goal to never again double cross American interests on the international stage - something that in Britain is called the \"special relationship\" - France answered the betrayal by both of her allies with a rejection of anything anglo-american. Also, the French were forever and ever sick and tired of their ineffective political system - it had taken 13 rounds to elect President Ren\u00e9 Coty in late 1953. So as you see, I skipped over many, many internal political crises and, you guessed it, even more squabbling.And you remember how I mentioned that a defeat in Indochina would result in the possibility of further colonial revolts? Well, from 1954 forward and increasingly escalating the late 1950s, the FLN rose up against French rule - the *Front de Lib\u00e9ration Nationale* fought for the independence of France's crown colony, Algeria. So dear was Algeria to France that they considered it part of mainland France, not a colony.France wanted a resurgence of the continental system, with a strong western Europe under French dominance under exclusion of Britain. France wanted peace and victory in Algeria. France wanted to never again be limited by angloamerican interests.And by France I mean Charles de Gaulle.Which finally brings us to him. What a guy.After a coup in Algeria by French generals and a French-led toppling of Tunisia, independent since 1956, the Fourth Republic at last collapsed under the pressure to finally see political reform done.Charles de Gaulle then just announced from his private house that he was willing to form a government, in part due to the fact that France was now threatened by military mutiny with paratroopers actively disobeying their orders, relocating from Algeria to Corsica and threatening to invade the mainland. He had retreated from politics but he was the military favorite and popular at that, and President Coty threatened to resign if parliament didn't allow power to pass to De Gaulle to prevent civil war. Parliament, with the exception of PCF, complied. De Gaulle became Prime Minister of the Fourth Republic and drafted a new constitution while in office. This constitution was at last presented to the French voters and overwhelmingly accepted by referendum in on 28 September 1958.De Gaulle's perhaps most significant contribution to French and European diplomacy and the balance of power was the end of the rivalry with Germany. He was connected in a deep friendship with West German chancellor Konrad Adenauer, who had voiced support for France even during the Suez Crisis. France threw out its angloamerican ties and chose to in the future team up with the Germans instead - something that would have been completely insane just 50 or even just 10 years prior. De Gaulle also personally prevented British accession to the various European economic agreements for quite some time - his personal anglophobia surely didn't help. Nowadays, approval ratings of the Franco-German alliance are above 75% and often top out at over 90%, far ahead of each country's friendliness towards the US and UK. Europe's perhaps bloodiest rivalry turned into a friendship akin to that of Poland and Hungary. Rather impressive.In the end, Charles de Gaulle perhaps failed to remake France into a superpower, but his decisive action was a big step towards the 1992 European Union - an economic bloc that few nations in the world can do without.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The French 4th Republic collapsed in 1958 when the French military seized power in a coup d'\u00e9tat.

Iran-Contra had dented Reagan's public approval, but he still retained a great deal of public support. There was also no guarantee that Americans would view the scandal as severe enough to warrant impeachment. As many Republicans argued, should the president and his staff really be charged with a crime simply because they were trying to bring kidnapped Americans back home? That would have been a tough narrative for Democrats to combat. There was another political consideration for Democratic leaders to consider as well. Namely, any potential impeachment proceedings would probably not end until after the 1988 presidential election. Reagan would therefore already be out of office, leading Democrats to believe that impeachment would be largely superfluous. **Lack of evidence:**Congress did not have conclusive proof that Reagan was directly involved in the arms-for-hostages deal. As one of the chief counsels to the Senate Iran-Contra committee stated, impeachment would have required an \"extraordinarily high standard of proof\" based on \"credible, direct, and conclusive evidence of guilt.\" At the time, they didn't have access to any evidence that would fit that description. It was only after the congressional investigation that journalists and historians  discovered evidence of Reagan's central role in the Iran-Contra affair.Congressional leaders also believed that Reagan's impeachment would have damaged the legitimacy of America's political institutions. Many Democratic leaders had sat through the Watergate proceedings and remembered the constitutional crisis it created. They simply didn't want to put the country through that again, although they stipulated they would do so if there was clear evidence of criminal actions by the president.  **International politics:**International politics likely played a secondary, but still significant role, in the decision not to impeach. At the same time congressional investigations into Iran-Contra were underway, Reagan was trying to establish better relations between the United States and Soviet Union. In particular, Reagan hoped that the two superpowers could soon sign a momentous nuclear arms limitation agreement. Impeachment proceedings would have greatly damaged Reagan's international standing. Foreign leaders would have no desire to work with a president whose domestic political standing was in serious doubt. Moreover, impeachment would have certainly consumed all of Reagan's attention and, consequently, stalled any chance at a U.S.-Soviet arms limitation treaty.Taken together, these reasons led congressional Democrats to discard impeachment. The risks were too great, the rewards too little, and the outcome too uncertain.Edit: fixed some spelling and grammar**Sources:**The best source on Iran-Contra is Malcolm Byrne, *Iran-Contra: Reagan's Scandal and the Unchecked Abuse of Presidential Power* (University Press of Kansas, 2014).Doug Rossinow's *The Reagan Era: A History of the 1980s* provides a good overview on the subject.", "label": 0}, {"content": "Ronald Reagan was a president who was a defender of the US Constitution.

More on that in a moment.The first passenger elevator was invented by Elisha Otis, whose name may ring a bell for being the founder and namesake of the ubiquitous Otis Elevator Company. Otis' device was unique in that it was marketed as a *safety* elevator that employed a system of gears (sorry if I've abused the technical term here, I'm hopeless at math, robotics and all sorts of black magic you engineers use) that interlocked with \"teeth\" in order to prevent a freefall in case the cable holding the elevator car snapped. Modern elevators use a similar albeit more sophisticated system, but it's easiest to see in [this 19th century diagram](_URL_2_) from one of Otis' own exhibitions.While elevator accidents were rare, the psychological impact of Otis' elevator was nothing short of extraordinary. Most Americans (and, indeed, Europeans) alive in 1850 lived in townhouses and low-rise apartment buildings rarely exceeding five to six stories in height. These buildings required all of the occupants to use stairs in order to get from the ground floor to their rooms above in a settlement pattern dating back to Roman *insulae*. With an elevator, however, buildings could be built even higher in a fashion that guaranteed the safety of their occupants. This might seem like a no-brainer, but cognitively accepting that a building could be built three or four times as tall as the largest building you've ever seen was a significant hurdle in urban development: the equivalent impact to modern eyes would be seeing a space elevator or some sort of massive construction project today. Victorian Americans continued to live in low-rise housing, but Otis' safety elevators soon found widespread use in commercial buildings on both sides of the Atlantic.Most Americans of means would have first encountered elevators in hotels or office buildings, where they began to be built en masse in the period following the Civil War. Residential elevators began to see credence in large mid-rise buildings approximately two decades later, by which time they were considered an acceptably safe form of transit. The first major apartment house in New York to use an elevator was the Dakota whose developer, Edward Cabot Clark, directed Henry Hardenburgh to go-all out with a then-unheard of six elevators for residential use. Early passenger elevators required operators to use a type of [lever that would control the speed of the elevator](_URL_1_) in order to ascend or descend. This required some skill. Elevator operators would adjust the speed of the lever to match the grade of the car with the grade of the floor so that occupants could board and depart on an even surface, a task that took the Otis Elevator several decades to fix. In 1924, Otis began to tinker with a semi-automatic signal system that would fix the problem of creating a level surface between slab and cab, but the first semi-automatic elevator wouldn't appear until 1937 and the first fully-automatic elevator until 1950. While major office buildings were quick to adopt them in a competitive market that sought to attract tenants, residential buildings were significantly slower to replace their existing mechanisms due to the expense involved.There is also the matter of a personal touch. Many elevator operators continued to function as ushers of sorts, directing occupants to certain office suites or apartments, sometimes dropping off mail and packages to residents of especially nice apartment buildings or even subbing as porters. This therefore meant that the elevator operator evolved into a sort of price-effective building amenity -- it was cheaper to keep on two elevator operators at an average annual salary of $3,120 (1950) than to replace their existing elevators with expensive new technology. It also allowed the building management to pick and choose staff at certain times of day, allowing operators to function as a sort of generic employee as time moved on. Elevator operators continue to exist today, although they mostly exist as a sign of conspicuous consumption due to the high cost of labor.edit: grammar, repeating words/phrases, cleaned up sentence structure. wrote this at 2am.edit 2: This is a shameless plug, but if you thought elevators could be interesting, [I'd love to direct you to this post I wrote about the history of Afghanistan](_URL_0_).

Now, whether they all believed it was the *right* thing to do, whether they believed it was the *utilitarian* thing to do, and whether they *indirectly* expressed a sense of failure or anger--that is, shall we say, a rather nebulous topic in biographies of the various Kennedys.One camp, headlined subtly by Doris Kearns Goodwin and like a sledgehammer by Laurence Leamer at the two poles of the spectrum, sees in Joseph's actions after the 1941 \"surgery\" a man seeking solace (Goodwin) or who understood he had committed a major sin (Leamer). Joseph initially placed Rosemary at a rehab/care facility called Craig House that had an excellent reputation and charged the fees to back it up. Joseph's biographer (and actual professional historian) David Nasaw shows on the basis of letters sent to family members that Joseph most likely visited Rosemary several times over the course of the 1940s, although it became horribly clear she would regain any more of what had been wrenched away from her than some motor skills. Joseph's words to his family are noncomittal--\"looks very well\" \"feeling quite well.\" In 1949, probably owning up to the long-term prognosis, he arranged a special place for her at an institution/\"school\" in Wisconsin run by Franciscan Colettine nuns. As in, he gave *buckets* of money to the place for special accommodations for her. Of course, while Joseph was doing all of this, he was keeping his family away from visiting Rosemary themselves, and misleading them about the shockingly awful lobotomy results. Whether he was trying to insulate himself from his wife Rose's wrath, or protect his family from seeing what he'd done, OR protect his family from seeing that what he perceived as a last-ditch attempt to help her had still failed, is left to question.For his part, Nasaw, whose take is generally considered among the most equitable, refuses to make a judgment call on whether Joseph believed he had done the wrong thing. But although he won't go as far to paint Joseph as a father with at least *some* sorrowful feelings for his daughter as Goodwin, she is much more brutal about the effect this had on Rose. She tells the story of Rose asking her friends over and over, \"Why didn't you tell me?\" only for her friends to say, \"we didn't know either.\" In her memoirs, she wrote: >  The operation eliminated the violence and the convulsive seizures, but it also had the effect of leaving Rosemary permanently incapacitated. She lost everything that had been gained during the years by her own gallant efforts and by our loving efforts for her. She had no possibility of ever being able to function in a viable way in the world at large.I'm not sure how this is not generally accounted a direct attack on Joseph's decision, but it does not seem to be? But then, this may be a pattern. There is one letter where Joseph comments more extensively on Rosemary's existence in the world, rather than breezy mentions of doing well. In 1958, he wrote to the nuns of St. Coletta's expressing his deep gratitude for their \"persevering kindness\" towards Rosemary. And pretty much every writer quotes the same lines: >  I am still very grateful for your help. After all, the solution to Rosemary's problem has been a major factor in the ability of all the Kennedys to go about their life's work and to try to do it as well as they can.Nasaw offers zero commentary; Goodwin suggests he is expressing sorrow for the outcome, and maybe or maybe not the decision. Disability rights advocates, on the other hand, have pointedly asked, \"Is Rosemary not 'all the Kennedys'?\" And in Joseph's words, they find him saying that isolating Rosemary in Wisconsin, away from the world's knowledge and from her own family, was the only way that the rest of them could be successful. That is to say: people with cognitive disabilities are a problem to be solved, and to be solved by exclusion.Of course, the rest of the Kennedys went on to champion mental health services and services for people with cognitive disabilities on the national and even international scale. Rose Kennedy was orchestrating donations for child neurology research through the Kennedy Foundation into the 2000s--and, for whatever bitterness she held, ensuring that things with a name attached would memorialize Joseph as well as herself. Jack signed a series of mental health services bills into law; while they ultimately resulted in massively inadequate care for a lot of people when the requires facilities were never built (a failure of money and a crime of NIMBYism), Senator Daniel Moynihan suggested that Jack would have *flipped tables* in the White House if he thought people like his sister would not be taken care of. Eunice Kennedy Shriver's activism in creating an arena for social life and growth in the Special Olympics I've discussed elsewhere in the thread. Ted Kennedy was pushing for mental health insurance coverage parity until the end of his life. And people generally agree that the Kennedys did a lot to raise awareness of the actual, real existence of people with cognitive disabilities and mental health disorders--and more to the point, of starting to crack the stigma on talking about them in the first place.They shouldn't get all the credit. The 1950s saw mothers (and some fathers, but mostly mothers) of children with Down's syndrome banding together in parents' groups--ARC is founded in 1951--and did a lot to cast off the idea that a diagnosis of developmental disability was *the absolute end* for the togetherness of the family. On the other hand, you can't argue with the impact of the visibility--and pocketbooks--of the Kennedys.I'm not a cynic who sees the other Kennedys \"using\" Rosemary as a platform, or rather, of \"taking advantage\" of her. Nevertheless, I have to wonder why--in the face of all the crusading--Rosemary herself was never allowed a presence. The lobotomy destroyed the person she had been...but there are all kind of people at all levels of cognitive ability in America. So I think it's a real question that both historians assessing the situation and disability rights advocates have to ask: were they (and hence, people in a similar situation) keeping Rosemary out of sight because of guilt, shame, unwillingness to criticize the family patriarch? Or did they conclude based on what they knew of Rosemary's own thoughts and hopes, rather than their own, what *she* would have preferred...had she only been able to voice them herself?Further Reading:* David Nasaw, *The Patriarch: The Remarkable Life and Turbulent Times of Joseph P.

The concept of *coolness*, however, is more recent. This use of \"cool\" emerged into wider consciousness in and through jazz musicians and music in the late 1930s and 1940s.  In particular, black jazz artists deployed the term to define a certain sensibility, a way of playing music and of *being* in the world. \"That's cool\" or \"I'm cool\" or \"keeping cool\" united the ideas of control, relaxation, intensity, individuality, and conscious presentation/performance--against hostile external forces. ([This follow-up question](_URL_1_) explains why contemporary African-American jazz musicians found particular power in hot/cold metaphors.) In the songs of black musicians of the 1940s, like \"Keep Cool, Fool\" (Erskine Hawkins) and \"Stay Cool\" (Count Basie), the significance of \"controlled, relaxed intensity\" in the face of toxic white culture stands out starkly: sharper-than-glass public composure and conscious, rational self-creation fly in the face of the range of pop cultural stereotypes of African-American men--the Angry Black Man, the peppy and dim-witted minstrel figure, the obsequious and self-negating Uncle Tom.Thus, the manifestation of \"cool\" by black jazz musicians had a contextualized social power specific to black culture, and especially black masculinity. But Dinerstein argues that as the *word* cool leeched into broader (not just black, not just music-related) useage, people glommed onto not its *surface* meaning but its underlying one.Although \"cool\" first emerged in the late 1930s, Dinerstein argues, the instrinsic message was exactly what the traumatized post-World War II, late imperialist West wanted and needed to hear. \"Cool\", on a deeper level, was the conscious construction of self as rebellion--a \"public mode of covert resistance.\"He ties the importance of this to a number of cultural currents in 1940s-50s America (and to a lesser extent Europe--America is his primary focus). World War II was an existential crisis/turning point for the West, an undeniable marker of the failure of its collective ideologies to *necessarily* make the world better instead of worse. In addition to realization of the horrors of the war and the Holocaust, the time period marked the earliest consciousness of Western white power that maybe Western imperialism was an *inherently bad* thing according to colonized people. And specific to the NATO bloc, you might call it, individualism was a politically promoted and powerful tool against the anxieties of nuclear war with Communists.There was also further proddings at questioning a rock-hard system of necessary Christian virtue versus accepting the darker side of human emotionality to a limited, productive degree. And of course the war and its aftermath brought about a massive crisis in masculinity. (Masculinity is always in crisis, and masculinity in crisis is always causing things.)Dinerstein traces early *specific* manifestations of this underlying sentiment through multiple Venn diagram circles of Western culture: black male jazz musicians, white male film noir protagonists, and white male and female existentialist philosophers (no, really). This is a fascinating, and more importantly compelling, choice of cultural nexuses because they appear, on the surface, so distinct from each other. But that is precisely his point: a given appearance of cool is almost beside the point. The underlying sense of \"conscious construction of self as rebellion, without people realizing it's an act\" was the meaning that people took--and more to the point, *take*--out of \"cool.\"There are some really interesting asides throughout the book that help convince me Dinerstein is on the right track with his philosophically-tinged cultural analysis. One point I really liked was the emergence of \"chill\" and \"to chill\" out of black culture in the 1980s. In other words: a time when and a group of people for whom *to choose to relax, to choose to opt out of Production* had become an act of social rebellion against welfare queen/entitlement rhetoric and the escalating societal value on giving everything to work.I do think there's a second layer to the story here: the technological (in terms of engineering technological, but also social technology) reasons that a word emerging in a music subculture at the end of the 1930s would have *New Yorker* essays dropping it casually by 1955--essentially, the reasons that Parisian philosophers and Southern black musicians and Rust Belt white factory workers *could* connect to an underlying meaning in a word because their cultural orbits were common enough to be mutually intelligible. I would like to see some analysis of the role of radio and early television, especially, in streamlining transmission of a nebulous idea across what we today would see as disparate social groupings.But overall, his portrayal of the underlying meaning of cool *through* its surface manifestations resonates even with our current, memetastic version: [*Look, look at all the fucks I give.*](_URL_0_)", "label": 0}, {"content": "The word \"cool\" has been around for a long time, and it has a long history.

Tolkien argues passionately that critics have spent too much time deriding *Beowulf* for not being what they want it to be (pagan/pre-Christian, historically accurate, sidelining the 'childish' monsters in favor of a realistic hero, etc). He argued for a *literary*, not just historical-critical, understanding, appreciation, analysis of the poem. \"Monsters and Critics\" is still considered one of the most important, influential, and even best literature essays of all time.I begin here partially for the reminder of just how awesome Tolkien was (this is the dude who, *in high school*, proposed the debate topic \"That the Norman conquests were a deplorable event\"). But also because it introduces the central question of writing about Tolkien and Middle-Earth: what are the boundaries of \"scholarship\" and \"criticism\"?The publication of LOTR, in particular, in the 1950s spawned a significant amount of attention in the \"book review\" sense.

In fact, Muir trashed them along the lines for which Tolkien had strived to redeem *Beowulf*: \"All the characters are boys masquerading as adult heroes.\" W.H. Auden, a big fan, commented, \"I rarely remember a book about which I have had such violent arguments...I can only suppose that some people object to Heroic Quests and Imaginary Worlds on principle.\"But certainly the most entertaining bad review came from Edmund Wilson, in his other life quite skilled at bringing psychoanalytic and Marxist criticism to texts, here reviewing LOTR as an exasperated father having read LOTR and *The Hobbit* countless times with his daughter (nb: his *daughter*): >   Now, how is it that these long-winded volumes of what looks to this reviewer like balderdash have elicited such tributes as those above? The answer is, I believe, that certain people-especially, perhaps, in Britain-have a lifelong appetite for juvenile trash. They would not accept adult trash, but, confronted with the pre-teen-age article...they bubble, they squeal, they coo.Tolkien, a high-profile figure, attracted the attention of high-profile literary figures *as critics* from the beginning. As for scholarship in the sense of the literary analysis that he had brought to bear on *Beowulf*, or that we might consider today? You can find glimmerings in the more positive and thoughtful reviews of the 1950s, such as Auden's. For the most part, late 1950s/early 1960s scholarship tended to consider LOTR in the context of Tolkien's life and writings, or Tolkien in his literary context.But the skyrocketing popularity of LOTR in the mass market in the 1960s had its impact in academia, too (both in terms of scholars paying more attention to \"popular culture\", and being consumers of said popular culture themselves). The first academic conference on Middle-Earth was organized in 1966, and many of the papers considered Tolkien's novels and poetry through literary analysis: good and evil in LOTR, the heroes of LOTR as a commentary on the genres of epic versus fairy tale, and so forth.If you're looking for a good overview of these earliest years of Tolkien criticism/scholarship/investigation of the person/study of the early reception (this is pre-*Letters*, pre-*Simarillion* publication, pre-Marxist/feminist criticism, and pre-Tom Shippey scholarship), I'd recommend wrangling a copy of:* John Ryan, *Tolkien: Cult or Culture?* (1969)another collection of essays resulting from a conference, although in scope ranging far beyond the 1966 one (which you can also track down papers from, in Mankato State University publications). Ryan had previously (1967) finished his *PhD dissertation* on the fiction of Tolkien and C.S. Lewis as mythology at Cambridge, which seems like a pretty good marker for the study of something being \"acceptable\" scholarship.But it's important to recognize that the scholarly enthusiasm for Tolkien was not necessarily scholarly *praise*. The 1970s rise of feminist and related schools of literary scholarship in academia brought with it both new and revised takes that criticized Middle-Earth in a much more rigorous and less dismissive way than Muir's \"juvenile trash.\" Even Naomi Mitchison, Tolkien's close friend and proofreader, came to criticize the (lack of) presence and role of women in LOTR. The point of critics like Mitchison and Catharine Stimpson was not simplistic 'there should be women,' but rather, the way in which an overwhelmingly monolithic, masculine presence tilted and twisted the narrative in light of the idea of [crafting an English mythology](_URL_0_). The study of Anglo-Saxon literature had once been rooted in a nationalist, exclusionary, and superior motive; Stimpson argued that LOTR's gender and class politics celebrated that ideal.The publication of *The Silmarillion* in 1977 (which was almost universally disliked/puzzled at) and then two crucial works of scholarship, Tom Shippey's *The Road to Middle-Earth* (1982) and  Verlyn Flieger's *Splintered Light: Logos and Language in Tolkien\u2019s World*, are generally considered the beginning of the next (modern?) phase of Tolkien scholarship, opening up cultural/linguistic/contextual analysis in addition to the traditional markers of literary analysis (quest, epic, good and evil) and political perspectives. \"Tolkien studies\" as a catchphrase/subfield is generally dated to the mid-1990s, and the *Tolkien Studies* academic journal launched in 2004. Those probably have more to do with trends in academia than anything Middle-Earth specific, because it's pretty clear that Tolkien scholarship, wrapped up in but flavored differently than Tolkien *criticism*, had already enjoyed several healthy decades.", "label": 0}, {"content": "I'm an established professor of English literature in the 1950s.

However, what little scholarship there is, suggest something that is not very surprising: The Nazis weren't fans of tattoos except those that fulfilled a clear functionality like the SS blood type tattoos or the camp tattoos.It seems there have been at least local laws in Germany heavily regulating tattoos or more specifically the public showing of tattoos since before the Nazis. The literature often mentions a 1911 prohibition of \"fully tattooed women in public\" though I could not verify if that was a local or national law. What little information there is, seems to suggest that it was local since there is at least one case of a woman in Berlin being escorted out of a bar because of her tattoos. That was Maria Finke, wife of Kuddi Finke, one of Germany's first prominent tattoo artists, who had tattooed his wife on her whole body.Throughout the 1920s both tattooing as well as showing tattoos (a source of income for circus performers of the \"freak show\" variety) seems to have become more and more regulated in Germany. The most famous example of this is the Bracht'sche Erlass (Bracht's Decree) of 1932 in Prussia. Franz Bracht was the vice-Reichcommissar and commissar of the interior in Prussia after chancellor von Papen had effectively dissolved the SPD lead Prussian government in the so-called Preussenschlag and transferred its powers to the Reich government.Bracht did many things during his time, both as vice commissar and later minister of the interior under Schleicher but one of them was to completely outlaw the showing of tattoos in public; a practice adopted shortly after in all of Germany, meaning that no one could show their tattoos in public and people could especially not earn a living from that.This practice continued under the Nazis. Stephan Oettermann, a German cultural historian, mentions in his book *Zeichen auf der Haut. Die Geschichte der T\u00e4towierung in Europa.* (Signs on Skin. A History of Tattoos in Europe) that the Nazis indeed outlawed both showing tattoos in public as well as tattooing itself and that having a tattoo was reason enough to get a person arrested and send to a concentration camp. While I couldn't wholly verify this information (the footnote Oettermann gives is a German book from the 70s I do not have access to atm), I could verify that in 1938 when the police initiated the \"Aktion Arbeitsscheu Reich\" (Action Work Shy Reich) during which people whom the Nazis called \"asocial\" were arrested in large numbers, one directive for the police about who to arrest reads: >  The police has to take action against all forms of showmanship, especially the kind that violates the healthy people's feelings (gesundes volksempfinden). This includes but is not is not limited to showmen of abnormal body (fish men, bird men, animal men and so forth but also tattoos. (...) If bodily health of those individuals allows they are to be brought to a mental facility.Furthermore, what I could also verify is the fact that several well-known German tattoo artists were imprisoned in concentration camps, namely Wilhelm \"Willi\" E. Blumberg and Albert Heinze, two of the first professional tattoo artists in Germany. They too were swept up in \"anti-social\" actions though it is likely that the Nazis saw additional reasons to them being tattooed for such an action.Traditionally, tattoos at that point in time were associated with either people whom the Nazis deemed anti-social or criminal (like actual criminals as well as people of low socio-economomic stratas) and sailors but on the latter group I could unfortunately not find much pertinent information.Two exceptions were apparently made where tattoos fulfilled a practical function: Waffen-SS soldiers had bloodgroup tattoos and, of course, Auschwitz prisoners had their numbers tattooed. With Waffen-SS soldiers little information survives on how this practice started but the function was pretty obvious: To make medical aid easier. Oettermann tells of SS officers getting other tattoos as well but again, this is information I could not verify. In the camps, the practice started once in 1941 some camps and in particular Auschwitz had a large influx of former Soviet POWs. Originally, the prisoner numbers were sewn into clothing but when the appeareance of these groups lead to a lack of clothing, the practice of tattooing them started. This method was only applied in Auschwitz though while other camps issued badges.All in all, the Nazis most likely associated with tattoos with so-called \"asocials\" and took active steps to persecute tattoo artists and those who earned a living through showing their tattoos. It is a likely guess that people with tattoos were not regarded too highly by them.Sources:* Stephan Oettermann: Zeichen auf der Haut.

Because those are underlying assumptions of your question that make it difficult to answer. those would be (1) that the story of Sodom and Gomorrah is, or is even intended as a literal historical account as opposed to a transcribed morality tale and (2) that the english version which references gang-rape is an accurate translation of the underlying hebrew stories. First, most academic experts agree that the Hebrew Bible (i.e. the old testament)  is a compilation of oral histories.  See [*Schinderman* How the Bible Became a Book: The Textualization of Ancient Israel (Cambridge University Press 2004)](_URL_0_) - [you can read a briefer summary in this PBS article](_URL_2_)  So when things like the story of Sodom and Gomorrah appear in the Hebrew Bible, one of the first things you have to understand is that those are transcribed versions of oral histories told by the Israelite people.   Oral histories can be extensive and detailed, but they are not in the same category as detailed written histories.  The point is themes and morals.  The morale of the story is about hospitality.  Lot has a religious duty of hospitality to strangers. he honors his duty of hospitality at great cost to himself. he was a righteous man.  The inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah were not hospitable people, in fact they were terrible and the opposite of hospitable, and they were destroyed. Second, there is a substantial dispute among translators whether biblical account described in Genesis 19 actually describes rape.   The hebrew word used is \u05d9\u05d3\u05e2 \"yada\" (don't honestly know whether the pasted hebrew characters will transcribe).  Some translators argue this word carries the cannotation of an \"intimate\" relationship, but only a minority of uses in the old testament use that word as a euphemism for sex.  [others argue the focus of the story is on inhospitability rather than an act.](_URL_1_) To answer your question directly.  The only references in \"ancient\" texts that I'm aware of also address the same story described in the bible.   The events of Sodom and Gomorrah are back-referenced multiple occasions in the bible and are referenced in Rabbinic literature and also in the Quran.  I'm not aware of any other independent ancient texts that describe strangers coming to a home and wanting to gang-rape newcomers to town for some reason. However, if we look at the alternative interpretation that the primary focus of the story is about hospitality.  There are ancient arabic/persian/indian folktales that likewise tell of various \"bad things\" happening to people that are inhospitable to strangers.  Some of these can be traced to at least the 8-9th century baghdad, with earlier oral origins.  See Van Gelder, G. J. (2000). God's Banquet: Food in Classical Arabic Literature.

We can find contributing factors in the primary source record, the practicalities of archaeology, the state of secondary scholarship, and the long stranglehold of \"classical\" education and adulation in the West.I'm going to write this from a western, primarily Anglophone perspective, although it will become clear that the specifically Western factors involved affect Near Eastern and Asian scholars as well.In terms of primary sources: internal to the Mongols, the source record is extremely weak and late. The oldest surviving textual source, known today under the excellent title *The Secret History of the Mongols*, was written sometime after 1228. Even then, our copy is in Middle Mongolian, but recorded in and for a Chinese context in the early 14th century. Igor de Rachewitz argued in 1965 that the *Secret History* was an original for the Mongols, not just the sole survivor. Genghis Khan had ordered the adoption of Uighur script for the writing of the Mongolian language, reinforcing our understanding of earlier Mongol illiteracy; the text itself seems to be a collection of oral genres mashed together rather than reflecting any established written genre from surrounding civilizations--and definitely not reflecting the internal historiography that Mongols under the Yuan dynasty would produce.Later on, even with Kublai Khan's advisors convincing him that the history of the Mongols starting from Genghis' sons needed to be written (the *Secret History* covered to that point), the segmented Mongol Empire had entire swathes that just...shunned an internal historiography. Thus, even with the Mongols developing an elite literate class within the Golden Horde or the Chagatai Khanate, they seem to have preferred to maintain *oral* histories rather than written ones.The other body of Mongol Empire writing that survives is diplomatic letters especially to the West, which exist in Latin translation. But the utility of this corpus for informing us about the Mongols themselves is limited by its purpose, especially since Latin Europe had a vested interest in seeing the Mongols as potential converts to Christianity and allies against Muslims.Then there are the external written sources from the people who interacted with and reacted to the Mongols. There are lots of these!...And they are written in medieval versions of Chinese, Persian, Arabic, Turkish, Russian, Armenian, Georgian, Old French, Italian, and Latin.To really get a grip on the Mongols, a scholar would need a handle on a rather breathtaking number of languages, *or* access to reliable translations. This is why \"how the West reacted to the Mongols\", as Peter Jackson points out, has been a rather popular line of scholarship since the 1820s...in the West.Which leads us to the secondary scholarship problem: it's dispersed among even more languages than the primary sources. Bits and pieces of analysis of the Mongol Empire have absolutely been done! Are ongoing! And often impossible to access for the majority of scholars.Archaeology, which is ever more important even to historical fields with a strong textual record, poses challenges for tackling the Mongol Empire as well. The Empire was *big*, y'all. There's not as much \"knowing where to look\" as there is when, say, walking through Rome. And much of the space the Empire held--including actively held, with outposts and castles--is not very densely populated today. So in England, for example, you've got another medieval village discovered when the city goes to build a parking lot or an apartment building. That kind of serendipity is less likely to occur for archaeologists searching out Mongol material culture.And finally for present purposes, I'll talk about the overarching, many-tentacled influence of the Western inheritance of classical (Greco-Roman) culture. I was originally going to make a joke about how if you're comparing density of historical scholarship on a subject, ancient Rome is about as useful a metric as the tanks of World War II. But the fact is--that is *not* a given, that is an active, ongoing choice of European/American historiography. Even with \"barbarian\" appropriation and alteration of *Romanitas* in the early Middle Ages, \"Rome\" as an idea held a certain allure, a prestige that everyone wanted to tie their own polities into. In the 14th century, early humanist writers lament how the world has fallen into a dark age *since the high point of Rome*; the Renaissance of the 15th-16th centuries was a group of white men wanting to *bring back Rome*. Rome has been at the center of historiography and the west in more ways than just the immense debt we owe to Edward Gibbon--the whole idea of \"western civilization\" derives from a culture repossession of 'classical' heritage. Into the 20th century, learning Latin and Greek was the basics of an advanced education; \"classics\" is not only its own field of study, but monopolizes the label \"Classic\" for Greece and Rome above the classical traditions of every other society on the planet.So for Westerners, learning Latin and Greek in the course of a formal education was for so long a necessity because of our belief in the importance of classical heritage...but that also made it much easier to study Greece and Rome because people could read the sources!And the linguistic imperialism of the west continues today with the surpassing importance of English in historiography. Historians trained in western graduate schools must know English, French, German, and then (or possibly substituting for French/German) the languages relevant to their own research. What if we required historians to learn Arabic or Farsi and Chinese or Japanese, and then allowed the *substition* of French or German for one if their research demanded it?In the case of Mongol research, that would connect Anglophone scholars with the scholarly community that *doesn't* produce writing in English, French, or German. It would provide a basis for tackling a body of sources that is immense when you combine languages.And it is almost definitely not going to happen. What I said above about how Europeans, and European-descended North America, viewing Greece and Rome as the \"foundation of western civilization\" since, well, since Greece and Rome? This invents a continuity, a line from them to us (I am American) today, which has major ramifications for scholars having to defend our existence as scholars, not just the conclusion of our research. There are, they say, two reasons to study the Middle Ages (slash Renaissance slash European history etc). One, because it's the foundations of the *modern* world and lets us see how we got here today. Two, because the Middle Ages are f*cking weird. If you take a sweeping, people-focused historical approach, as history academia to its credit is starting to/trying to do, you absolutely find the \"foundations of western civilization\" in a web *with* other civilizations; it's not a story that can be told in isolation. But the mainstream idea of \"foundations\" tends to be intellectual, scientific, probably less so religious today. Lawyers drop Latin terms into everyday prose because the roots of our legal traditions are Roman; you're reading this in a font that derives from the 15th-16th century humanists believing that the Carolingian miniscule handwriting their classical sources were written in was actually Roman handwriting.So ultimately, it's easy to say \"the Mongols didn't write much.\" It's easy to say, \"the Mongols are hard to find in the dirt.\" But look--the Mongols are a medieval civilization, and if there is anything medievalists do better than you, it is drawing entire books and decades-long scholarly controversies out of the doodle marks in the margins of one manuscript, or the discovery of a single coin. We absolutely could do better. But long, long patterns of Western cultural chauvinism have shaped a scholarly environment where research on the Mongols is compartmentalized in isolated linguistic/geographic communities. And we're a long ways from fully reconciling those divides.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Mongol Empire was much more recent than Rome; why do we know so much less about it? Was there a difference in how literate the societies were, did the Mongols prize secrecy, am I betraying western biases, or is it something else?", "label": 1}, {"content": "If you're a peasant in later medieval Germany being attacked, robbed, and burned out, chances are you know exactly who it is even if you don't know who the people are. It's probably a raiding party from a local knight, and you're probably caught in a feud between two of them.It was no fun to be a peasant caught in any kind of warfare between nobles or kingdoms; the English chevauchees in France during part of the Hundred Years' War being the most notorious but far from the only examples. However, feuds--and the problem was especially rife in the Holy Roman Empire--were a particular form of ongoing enmity and violence between members of the lower nobility in which targeting one's own peasants *and* the peasants of the enemy was a well-worn tactic.You can think of a feud in the sense of an \"honor battle,\" in which one party claims to have had their honor attacked over a spurned marriage, or castle built on the other's territory, or some such. But often, as Hillay Zmora showed, events like this were more pretext than actual cause. Feuds were about lower-level lords jockeying for power not only between each other but in the eyes of the higher nobility and princes, perhaps even the emperor. And in Zmora's words, peasants were both \"objects of\" and \"pawn in\" these vicious games.On one level, the point was straightforward ruination of the property of the feuder's opponent. Chronicle accounts of one Franconian feud in the fifteenth century mention parties shooting not just sheep flocks but *shepherds* with arrows, firing cannonballs at small towns, burned villages and crops, destroyed local resources like fishponds and patches of forest.A second purpose of attacking peasants--the robber knight's own, or their opponent's--was *fear*. They wanted to terrorize peasants into essentially doing whatever they wanted in terms of paying tribute to them, *not* paying taxes to the opponent, providing labor for castle-building, and so forth.And third, to attack peasants in a village belonging to one's enemy was psychological warfare against the *noble* (screw the peasants; who cares about them). A feud between the city of Nuremberg and a nearby robber knight at the end of the 15th century saw Schott's men raid a village--but not the village proper; the *hideout* where villagers fled upon their approach. The attackers apparently had brought some women (I am not aware of more specific details) along with them to pretend to act as negotiators/friendly faces. One peasant stepped out to talk; the attackers promptly shot him full of arrows. According to a contemporary pamphlet describing the feud's course, one of the arrows was engraved \"For a Nuremberger.\" The point was to attack the city (city's leadership). Peasants were pawns.In medieval Europe, peasants did have the right to appeal bad treatment. Villages might send delegations to one of the robber knights involved in the feud demanding protection; they could appeal to the duke of the larger territory (or territories) in which the feuding knights held their land and castles; they could try appealing to the Church via the episcopate. (Of course, sometimes one of the feuding parties *was* the Church, in the form of a bishop-lord, and the appeal would be pretty much DOA. Studying twelfth century violence, Thomas Bisson found exactly one case of the Church willing to censure and punish its own for feuding tactics like murder and arson).Would it work, though? Ehhhh.There are, of course, plenty of cases where the attackers were more what OP probably has in mind--local bandits or outlaws out to steal or just to be violent. An ongoing feud (or larger war) could even abet this kind of behavior, as outlaw gangs were more likely to be active (and more likely to be able to stay active, that is, not dead) during periods of chaos.Strictly speaking, territories in the Holy Roman Empire *did* have officials responsible for preventing these attacks and catching offenders. Unlike France and England, German territories did not have standard official courts set up to prosecute such offenders, so a town mayor or lord's delegate is *probably* who stepped in. But first the bad guys had to be caught. And, frankly, the designated/hired officials were terrible at their job.Some of it wasn't their fault. Leonberg had 1000 inhabitants, one constable, and two watchmen. And typically, constables and watchmen were also responsible for basic community policing (in early modern Germany, a bit later than OP's frame of interest, this included things like making sure wedding celebrations didn't get out of order). So you can imagine how popular constables were. (With watchmen, there was another problem--Gerald Strauss explains how late medieval Nurembergers despised how *noisy* the watchmen were at night, always calling out to each other.)Where constables tended to have more success wasn't interrupting in-progress attacks or catching offenders of specific robberies, murders, and acts of arson. Instead, it was general territorial managements--rooting out bandits of any kind in their hideouts in other villages, forests, and so forth. Villages could organize posses to go on the hunt like this, too. That seems to be what happened in the case of a cluster of Hungarian villages in 1493 dispatching the Glowaty brothers' outlaw gang step-by-step, one or two imprisonments and hangings at a time.For on the spot action, there was one major recourse: the *Notruf* (\"hue and cry\" is the phrase you probably know) and mob justice. You may be familiar with the idea/legal principle that in order for a rape to be considered rape, the woman attacked had to raise a hue and cry *immediately*. (Now imagine how traumatized she was, and possibly injured, and definitely going to face significant shame from people who thought she was a slut who wanted it/asked for it anyway, and how much further trauma that might cause).But the *Notruf* wasn't only to catch rapists, of course. In fourteenth-century Germany, in fact, it was often a brutal anti-Semitic tool. Not just in fictionalized or outright fictional sermon exempla but in actual, chronicle and court-recorded situations, the Eucharist Host (bread) or some such would not be where it was supposed to be in a church. The priest who couldn't find it started shouting and knocking on doors and getting people fired up (in exempla/miracle stories, the missing Host *itself* cries out), and if the town or a nearby town had a Jewish community, you have the fixings for a pogrom. This is what happened in 1322 Ehingen, when blame decided to focus on a local Jewish woman and Christians murdered eighteen Jews in retaliation. Supposedly, a few Christian women later overheard one of their own admit to the deed/she let it slip in conversation, they reported it to the local bailiff, and the gulty Christian woman was arrested and burned at the stake. This is a little fishy, though--she allegedly stole the Host to perform a magic ritual of some sort or to sell it to local Jewish people for them to destroy, both of which are utterly stock tropes in Eucharistic exempla. However, the offered route of discovery--overheard or directly repeated gossip--is a good example of what Ulinka Rublack shows was a very common way criminals were caught and punished.In the case of Ehingen, of course, only after eighteen innocent people were murdered.Overall, you could say that the best possibility among very poor options for defense was an offense--but that by no means made it a *good* offense.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The masked men would be reported to the local lord.

The question of Shakespeare authorship, and evidence for Shakespeare's existence.If you're saying that high school English teachers are perpetuating the so-called \"Authorship Question\", which argues that the plays attributed to the person known as William Shakespeare were in fact not written by William Shakespeare, I am quite aghast. Simply put, this theory has no scholarly or scientific credibility, and should rightfully be put in the same category as climate science denial or people who believe the moon landing was fake.Though proponents of the authorship question sometimes suggest Shakespeare's authorship was in doubt during his own time, the arguments I've seen to that point really twist the reading of the texts they use (conflating what is conventionally understood as criticisms of Shakespeare's quality into criticisms of Shakespeare's authorship). The commonly accepted scholarly understanding is that the authorship question begins in the mid-19th century, and the first major work of the anti-Stratfordians (as those who reject Shakespeare's authorship are called) was *The Philosophy of the Plays of Shakspere Unfolded* written by an American, Delia Bacon, and published in 1857. Delia Bacon suggested that the true author must've been Sir Francis Bacon.Since then, the question has existed on the margins of Shakespeare analysis and interpretation, though never as a scientifically viable theory. In the 21st century, the question has gained increased public recognition as a result of the 2011 film *Anonymous* directed by Roland Emmerich, though likely the internet's propensity to enable conspiratorial theories of all kinds to flourish has helped as well. Like in *Anonymous*, a popular modern suggestion for an alternative author is no longer Sir Francis Bacon, but instead Edward de Vere.What the theories generally share in common is a strange and paradoxical combination of elitism and anti-elitism. On the one hand, the main impetus for rejecting Shakespeare's authorship, as it was for Delia Bacon, generally comes down to rejecting the suggestion that a simple common man of middle class background with a fairly boring biography could be one of the greatest literary geniuses of English and world history, and the candidates replacing Shakespeare are invariably of some 'higher' level of nobility and/or elite education. On the other hand, rejecting Shakespeare's authorship flies in the face of all available evidence or logic, and centuries of scholarly and scientific consensus, but this is all dismissed, often with insinuations of some kind of conspiracy or prejudice on the part of Shakespeare scholars not unlike the debate surrounding climate science.Now, I suspect this is the most likely question you're asking.But, you might also simply be referring to actual physical evidence we have of William Shakespeare's existence, without questioning the authorship. In that case, we only have a lack of evidence if we assume anachronistic standards of evidence. The reality is, that a person of William Shakespeare's standing and heritage simply would not leave much of a paper trail in 16th\\~17th century England. At least, not much that would survive to this day. There is overwhelming evidence from second hand accounts that William Shakespeare existed. That is, people talked about, and at times at, him publicly and in surviving records. Not unimportant, we have of course all his published plays and poems, some of which published in his lifetime and some posthumously by his friends and colleagues, which, per above, can all safely be attributed to him and be taken as evidence that he existed.What we do not have much off are first hand accounts by Shakespeare himself regarding himself. No letters by Shakespeare have survived, and for documents signed by him we only really have the major events, i.e. his marriage license, his last will and testament, that sort of things. But, as I noted, this is not so much lack of evidence, as evidence for his relatively low social standing and importance (in spite of literary genius). It matches up with the kinds of records that should survive. I should make explicit, perhaps, that it is a general fact of history that paper is not all that durable, especially the kind used before the industrial revolution. If paper records survive more than a century or two, it's generally either because they were buried/hidden somewhere (ala the dead sea scrolls) or someone, or someones, actively went to the trouble of carefully preserving and, when necessary, making new copies.Though, a focus on the lack of a Shakespearean paper trail is a bit out of date, in my mind. Since the passage credited to the so-called \"Hand D\" in the *Sir Thomas More* manuscript is now generally attributed to Shakespeare, meaning we do have three pages of Shakespeare's own hand-writing now.But the reasons for why is very specific to this play, and would only have happened for this play as opposed to any other.

He is somewhere been stranded and an actual prisoner on the island belonging to the \"lovely goddess\" Calypso. The poem implies that there was some mutual attraction between them initially. But in the *years* he's been on the island, that has evaporated. They sleep together every night, sure, but Odysseus isn't happy about it. It is possible, although not definitive, to read the situation as coercion/rape.But this isn't the concern of the poem itself, which doesn't frame this as a \"normal\" relationship between men and women. Why not? Because Calypso isn't a woman, she's a *goddess*. When Hermes comes along to pass on the order for her to help Odysseus leave the island, *that* is the framework with which she protests. From the Penguin Classics translation: >  You are hard-hearted, you gods, and unmatched for jealousy. You are outraged if a goddess sleeps openly with a man even if she has chosen him as her husband. You were the same when rosy-fingered Dawn fell in love with Orion. Free and easy yourselves, you were outraged at her conduct, and in the end chaste Artemis of the golden throne rose, attacked him in Ortygie with her gentle arrows and left him dead. And so again, when the lovely Demeter gave way to her desire and made love with her beloved lasion in the field of the three ploughed furrows, Zeus heard of it quickly enough and struck him dead with his blinding thunderbolt.The contrast with, of course, [Zeus](_URL_0_) is clear. Calypso gets to essentially denounce all of Greek mythology as sexist, even if it is not a sparklingly feminist message today.\"Adultery\" in the traditional sense, thus, is not the issue in this case.That said, K.J. Dover and other scholars are exquisitely clear that under Athenian law (to be fair, not necessarily the situation reflected by tradition of singing the *Odyssey*), adultery with citizen women was very not okay for men. Naturally, it was a crime committed not against morality or the polity, but against a specific man who had legal control of the woman involved: >  But Greek laws were not lenient towards adultery, and *moikbeia*, forwhch we have no suitable translation except \"adultery,\" denoted notonly the seduction of another man\u2019s wife, but also the seduction of h swidowed mother, unmarried daughter, sister, niece, or any other womanwhose legal guardan he was.Dover adds that adultery was considered *worse* than rape, because rape was considered a crime of passion and the moment whereas to carry on an affair involved *seduction*--that is, a long period of time and effort. Xenophon's *Hiero*, which is more or less a work of political philosophy, compares the two: >  At any rate, it is not uncommon for the laws ofcommunities to allow people to kill seducers, and only seducers, with impunity, andthe thinking behind this law is obviously that seduction impairs the affection a wifefeels for her husband. After all, if sex takes place without the woman\u2019s consent, thisdoes not make the slightest difference to the regard her husband feels for her, as longas the affection she feels for him remains inviolate.Now, it's important to keep in mind that we're dealing primarily with normative or prescriptive sources here, not descriptive. (And Xenophon, for his part, is exaggerating a bit for rhetorical effect, as Edward Harris points out--seduction/adultery was by no means the only crime for which one could be executed.) The cuckolded man was afforded, in theory, a significant amount of say over how/whether the philandering man was punished. So even under the law, there would be a lot of room for flexibility or ambiguity in what actually happened.However, more literary/normative sources are particularly useful in reflecting one aspect of the situation: being seen as an adulterer was *not* good. The *fama* for such men would swirl with scorn and satire. Dover suggests that because women were seen as easily seduced and swayed by temptation meant that adulterers rather than the cheated-upon received the brunt of social derision.But just as we have to consider the context of Odysseus sleeping with (under ambiguous terms of consent) a *goddess*, the status of women in relationships outside marriage also mattered.

The Italians bombed hospitals and ambulances, deployed mustard gas via airplane and artillery shell, mutilated prisoners, and used expanding bullets. After the fall of Addis Ababa, the Italians resorted to similarly brutal methods to tamp down resistance. The worst example occurred after Ethiopian partisans attempted to assassinate the Italian viceroy in Ethiopia, Marshal Rodolfo Graziani on February 12, 1937 by throwing grenades at him during a public ceremony.Italian forces responded by firing into the crowd. For the remainder of the weekend, Italian soldiers killed Ethiopians indiscriminately; they chased and stabbed people in the streets, set fire to houses, and broke into the homes of foreign nationals to drag out and hang Ethiopians they were trying to protect. Hundreds took refuge in the American consulate, but went home after the Americans received guarantees about their safety from Italian officials. After the Ethiopians left, they were rounded up by Italians, taken a short distance away, and killed en masse.The Italians arrested a small group of young intellectuals Ethiopia's Emperor Haile Selassie had sent overseas to acquire college degrees. Torture was liberally used in their interrogations, including one method where a victim was wrapped from neck to toe in rope and then soaked in water. The swelling ropes would tighten until blood was oozing out of the victim's pores. Their execution by firing squad was almost a mercy.Thousands of Ethiopians were sent to concentration camps, one near Mogadishu and one on an arid island in the Red Sea. Relatives who tried to bring food or find their loved ones were flogged and sometimes thrown into the camps as well. The rations were kept at starvation levels, and the prisoners were worked mercilessly on sugar cane and banana plantations personally owned by Italian officials. Dysentery and malaria were rampant, and prisoners were picked out for execution on a daily basis. As many as half of the internees died before the camps were closed and the survivors were released.The massacre and its aftermath, known in Ethiopia as Yekatit 12 (after the date in Ethiopia's calendar), killed perhaps 20,000 people, a quarter of Addis Ababa's population. Overall, the Italian invasion killed at least a quarter-million Ethiopians, and many thousands more died during their occupation before British forces and Ethiopian partisans ended Italian rule in 1941. Throughout the occupation, despite a shift to a more conciliatory tone and Italian efforts to showcase infrastructural development and enlightened modernization, the Italians enacted harsh racial laws that set up an apartheid-like separation between the Ethiopians and Italian colonizers. Italian women who were convicted of sex with Ethiopian men faced concentration camp sentences. Ethiopians who resisted Italian authority could expect torture and detention on the for-profit labor camps set up by corrupt Italian officials.**Sources:***The Addis Ababa Massacre: Italy's National Shame*, by Ian Campbell*Fascist Modernities: Italy, 1922-1945*, by Ruth Ben-Ghiat", "label": 0}, {"content": "Fascist Italy committed many atrocities during World War II, including the massacre of the Jews of Milan in 1943, the massacre of the Roma in 1944, and the massacre of the Jews of Rome in 1943.

If so, I should certainly hope not--because *people in 14th century Scotland had no idea what \"sub-Saharan Africa\" was.* To have documentation of their presence would pitch us into a very special episode of *Outlander* indeed.The Latin medieval understanding of world geography, for whose presence we have ample evidence for among the late medieval Scottish literati (t.i. the people writing documents), traditionally divided the world into Europe, Asia, and Africa. But just like our modern seven continents are cultural constructs, so were theirs--and they weren't the same. For example: John of Fordun's *Chronica Gentis Scotorum*, from the 1380s, assimilates Egypt into Asia. It outlines Africa as including Libya, Upper Ethiopia, and Lower Ethiopia. Reasonable, and reasonably kind of sub-Saharan...except that John's Ethiopia is not our Ethiopia (or, probably more to the point, medieval Ethiopia): >  For Ethiopia is threefold: its western portion being mountainous, beginning at Mount Atlas; its middle portion sandy; and its eastern, a desert.Africa, then, is specifically (our) North Africa: >  By the Inland Sea, on the northern coast, is the country of Zeugnis, where Carthage once stood, and this is Africa proper.I'm citing the *Chronica Gentis Scotorum* here because it takes us to the requested 14th century. But it's important to point out that even 15th century sources--when there were Ethiopian communities established in Rome, Ethiopian Orthodox delegates to the Council of Florence, Aragonese and Ethiopian royals negotiating marriage alliances--don't differentiate a North and sub-Saharan Africa, and have very European-culture-oriented understandings of \"Africa.\"For example, Andrew of Wyndoun's *Original Chronicle of Scotland*, from the 1420s, has a bit better geographic sense than John's. He recognizes the land around the southern Nile as part of Ethiopia, and beyond Ethiopia is just \"wilderness.\" He situates \"Africa\" as:* Ethiopia, where the Queen of Sheba is from* Libya, the Pentapolis (a Roman province)* Carthage, where Dido reigned* Hippo, whence Augustine* Mauritania, where...nope, Andrew got nothing here.So we really should not expect to see records of \"sub-Saharan Africans\" in 14th century Scotland.But I assume the interest in this thread has nothing to do with sub-Saharan Africa and everything to do with black people.Well, I'm afraid you're out of luck there, too.

A person of color in medieval Spain or medieval France was...a Castilian or a French person, right?So what we see in art *and* in writing is a blend of skin color:geography-based heritage and skin color:morality. (And let's be clear, we are not dealing with nuances of color here). In romance literature, 'Saracen' characters sometimes have their skin change from black to \"white as milk\" when they convert from Islam to Christianity (*Cursor mundi*, 14th century). In the most famous German take on Arthuriana, *Parzival*, Feirefiz has a Muslim parent and a Christian parent, and...is *spotted*.  The *Estoria de Espana* blasts the conquering Saracens: >  Their faces were black as pitch, the most handsome among them was black as a kettle, their eyes shone like candlesand the *Song of Roland* says about Saracen character Abisme that he is \"black as pitch,\" with the archbishop wishing, \"This Saracen seems quite heretical; it would be much better if I were to kill him.\"You'll notice a pattern here: dark skin, in medieval writing, is associated *much* more closely with Islam than with Africa, much less Ethiopia. By the 14th century, Latin Europeans looked to Ethiopia to *save them from Muslims.* (I've discussed the issue of stark white/black skin color and morality [in this earlier answer](_URL_5_)).Benjamin Braude has discussed how European scholars gradually linked skin color and geographic heritage over the course of the fifteenth century: via Spanish and Portuguese slavers in West Africa, via Latin European courts deciding that dark-skinned enslaved people made excellent *objects* to keep at court as a sign of their power and prestige. By the turn of the 16th century, these courts included one of particular interest to us. That is when we start to read about \"black Moors,\" \"black ladies,\" \"Blak Elene\" who also seems to be named \"Elen More,\" and so forth at the court of King James IV--of Scotland.Which is exactly what we should expect, assuming no fluxes in the space-time continuum.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The scene in the Netflix original film \"Outlaw King\" is clearly depicting a small group of black people in a village market in Scotland, dancing, playing instruments and wearing bright clothing.

Long answer: In the mid-20th c. a standard hairstyle for women would take a substantial amount of time, and need to be \"set.\" Usually, a perm was applied on a regular basis to those with straight hair, and then the hair was \"set\" as needed (ranging from only for special events to every evening depending on the person.) The hair itself was washed infrequently, twice a week at most, and then re-set afterwards. Most women did bath more frequently, however. The process of washing your hair was ultimately a very time consuming process, so it makes sense that this would not be done on a daily basis.

This is my first time posting here, but I hope these will constitute primary sources here on /r/AskHistorians. Veronica Dengle, who is personally my favorite how-to writer on the topic from the mid-century outlines a process of washing hair that involves making liquid shampoo from a solid bar that has combined with warm water and scrubbing your hair  vigorously to get the dirt out, paying attention to the parts where dirt will gather. After washing it, several rinses of clean water are applied, and then the hair should be dried outdoors whenever possible. Then, a woman is to brush out and re-set her hair, dampening it with Toilet Water, which referred to a type of scented water and not...ahem...the water from our toilets.Her recommendation for timing: \"If you shampoo your hair every week, perhaps two soapings will be enough. But if you live in the city, or shampoo your hair every ten days to two weeks a third soaping is advisable.\" (Personality Unlimited: The Beauty Blue Book, 1943)Several other books I have of a similar type outline the same process. The last book I have that references this type of extensive hair washing process is a workbook from a curriculum published in 1964 entitled \"Charm.\"In short, the process of washing your hair was ultimately a very time consuming process, so it makes sense that this would not be done on a daily basis and could take a whole evening if someone wanted an excuse to not go out with someone!", "label": 0}, {"content": "Women in the mid twentieth century washed their hair with a comb and a squirt of shampoo.

Camps were liberated at different times, and in some cases retreating Nazi forces made deliberate efforts to clean out the camps or prisoners prior to surrendering them. Allied liberated camps had different outcomes than soviet camps etc. Because it's the easiest example, imagine you were a jewish man at Buchenwald or the Ohrdruf sub-camp, one of the earlier camps liberated by the allies.    The easiest thing to do is just walk you through the rough timeline. Allied forces take control of the Buchenwald camp on April 5, 1945 after german forces retreat from the area.  Based on numerous concerns, Allied military officers have inmates of the camp stay \"incarcerated.\" until they can be medically stabalized and a determination can be made on what to do with them.  The allies do bring in medical personnel and food supplies to begin treating the prisoners. For the first several weeks, hundreds of prisoners would continue to die daily.  Gradually conditions improved in the camps, although only to a point.  For our hypothetical prisoner from Buchenwald, you probably continue to live at Buchenwald for another 2-3 months perhaps, being fed allied military rations and being treated by allied doctors. you'll slowly regain some semblance of health  After the war ended the Allied Command faced the monumental task of repatriating some 7 million displaced persons within Europe. This included both Ethnic Germans that had settled in other parts of Europe as well as concentration camp survivors, refugees and others.  Allied policy was generally to attempt to repatriate as many of these persons as possible.   However, because the task could not be accomplished instantly, [displaced persons camps were established in europe](_URL_1_) these were refugee camps intended to house displaced persons, which included holocaust survivors as well as eastern Europeans.  On October 1, 1945, the [United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Programme](_URL_2_) is formally given legal control over the displaced persons program. However, the UNRRA is widely seen as having been under-staffed and under funded, and conditions in DP camps often were poor at best.    Based on allied and UNRRA policy, once you were healthy, would be moved to a \"displaced persons\" camp to be repatriated to your country of origin probably sometime between July and November 1945.   If you were Jewish you would most likely be moved into a camp in the US controlled section of occupied germany.  The UNRRA to avoid charges of discrimination, specifically [did not create any special policies towards jewish displaced persons](_URL_4_)   However, this was later changed and jewish survivors were given some special accomodations in terms of being grouped together. Those displaced persons would could be repatriated (germans, western europeans,  and the like) were quickly repatriated, leaving the bulk of the persons in DP camps to be eastern Europeans (Poles, Ukranians etc) and jews who could not be repatriated to their countries of origin.   Particularly if you were from an area that was now occupied by the Russians, you aren't likely to be forced to return. Rather, you will have at least a temporarily uncertain future, and will continue to live in the displaced persons camp in occupied germany for a number of months or years.   You are likely living in housing built by the US military or UNRRA, and fed by either US military or UNRRA personnel.  Conditions are poor at best, and downright abysmal at worst, with refugees living in cramped overcrowded housing and being fed insufficient food. Gradually, private aid agencies will step in to provide solutions to the problems, but they had limited impact. Many of these private aid agencies were juewish centric agencies. Conditions were made worse by further refugees fleeing soviet bloq countries. Between 1945 and 1948 there was an even larger percentage of Jewish refugees coming into DP camps, to the point where in 1948, an allied military commander closed the borders to further refugees, although the orders were not ironclad and many continued to come.   [This is a review of a book on the refugee crisis after WWII in general](_URL_3_) At this point, you get along basically in a similar way as any other refugee anywhere gets along.  Black market Micro-economies spring up in refugee camps based both on rations and on markets within the camps themselves. Cigarettes and Chocolate and rations are common currencies. If you have a marketable skill you perhaps try to earn some side income.  Prostitution was not an uncommon source of income.  You rely on others in the camp and established new networks for support.  Over time, many left the camps, but opportunities were somewhat limited and covert. Jewish groups started moving jewish residents into Israel at this point, but due to a British prohibition on settlement on palestine they often had to be smuggled (although, much like today, it was not terribly difficult). The big sea change was in May  1948, two significant things happened 1. [the US senate passed the  Wiley-Revercomb  Displaced Persons Bill](_URL_0_) this allowed 100,000 displaced persons to gain permanent residence in the United States. 2. In may 1948 the state of Israel was established, and immigration was opened to every person of Jewish Descent. (the return act wasn't formally passed until 1950, but once Israel was recognized, people could travel there openly) About 130,000 remaining displaced persons emigrated to Israel within the first three years of Israeli statehood, many were assisted by Zionist groups. Again, for our hypothetical resident from Buchenwald, you've probably moved to a DP camp somewhere in the American Zone of Germany. You have limited opportunity and limited resources. Perhaps if you can find gainful employment, or have family somewhere, you've gotten out before now, but if you truly have nothing, you're probably still in a DP camp by 1947 or early 1948. At this point, options become available. Per the above, you can scrounge together whatever savings you can beg, borrow and steal, and try to apply for a US visa and get on a boat to New York, or you can go to a Zionist group, and they will arrange for transport to the newly formed state of Israel.

The useful parts--wires are the big one cited--might be sorted and sold as scrap.Premodern building demolition in Europe was all about reusing what was reuseable, of course. One famous example is the piecemealing of Roman stone structures in early medieval Britain. Notre-Dame de Paris has Roman-era stone pieces in part of its foundation, and possibly some Carolingian as well. And of course, as I talk about in this cool [earlier answer](_URL_1_) the medieval city of Rome itself was largely built into or out of old Roman buildings!But lacking a real-life Merlin to engineer exotic contraptions that could haul heavy building materials from Ireland to Stonehenge, medieval people tended to skip that \"gaping hole\" stage. It was logistically just plain easier to salvage what could be salvaged and then build the ground *up* to smooth over ruins to the point you could build a new structure. In fact, this could become part of the building itself. In one type of construction, the ground was leveled off by packing in dirt and rubble, and the stone walls were constructed right on top of it. Otherwise, a building might be constructed around stone-and-mortar piers. A foundation trench would be dug, the pier constructed up to ground level, and the space around it packed in. From both France (Cluny) and England (London), there is evidence that in some places the use of piers was practiced in religious building in the early Middle Ages and then adopted for secular construction from the twelfth century or so.(John Schofield's excellent article \"The Construction of Medieval and Tudor Houses in London\" is available online, for anyone interested in understandable explanations of medieval construction beyond lists of basic materials. The [PDF](_URL_3_) is 41MB; caveat clickor.)So essentially, there's not really an intermediary stage *if* a particular space is going to be continuously inhabited.

If the buildings were also demolished in the Middle Ages or the early early modern era, it doesn't surprise me at all that there's no modern memory or record of what stood there. That's just not the kind of thing recorded in city archives. We might know from tax records or a parish register or a will that someone was a shoemaker, or a draper of secondhand fabric. We don't have a street address or the deed to a building.And medieval (and early modern) people were pretty used to rebuilding. Medieval peasants, according to Barbara Hanawalt, built and rebuilt houses fairly frequently. In cities, fires frequently gave people no choice but to rebuild.

The 1812 Overture was written in 1880 to commemorate the Russian victory over Napoleon during his invasion of Russia. It was originally written as part of the festivities for the opening of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, also built to commemorate that victory. The Tsar would also have his 25th anniversary of coronation in the same year, and an All-Russia Expo was coming to Moscow, so that idea was that the piece could be used as a big part of the spectacle for these events.I say that because the piece has become overwhelmingly associated, at least in the US, with a completely different event: 4th of July. And this association is actually one of the biggest reasons why the cannon fire is so well-known today.I'll get to that in a minute. First, did Tchaikovsky ever hear the piece with the cannon fire as he intended?The original idea not only included very precise cannon fire, but an additional brass band along with the pealing bells of the cathedral and other churches in the area. The cannons were going to be set up to electrical switches that would set the off at precisely the right time. This was a very complicated undertaking, but hey, the Tsar wants a big celebration, the Tsar gets a big celebration.Except, Tsar Alexander II was assassinated in 1881, before the planned celebrations. This, along with the fact that the cathedral didn't finish on time, meant that the piece was premiered in a tent at the Expo, with no cannons or bells.It still made an impression, though, and became one of Tchaikovsky's most well-known pieces. When he went on conducting tours it was usually on the program, most famously at the dedication of Carnegie Hall in New York, which he led in 1891. However, it seems that none of these performances, nor most of the performances in the decades after it was first premiered, featured the cannon fire as written in the score.Part of this was practical. I am not a military expert, so someone who is could possibly chime in about 19th century artillery. There are 16 shots in a roughly two minute period in the piece. There doesn't seem to be any contemporary cannon that could be safely reloaded and fired this quickly, necessitating multiple cannons (and multiple crews). The electric switches in the original plan were devised to get around this, but that was a much more complicated proposition at the time than it would be today.The [earliest recording](_URL_0_), from 1915, uses percussion instead of cannon fire, and this was the common practice for many years. Other orchestras used rifles firing blanks in their performances rather than the more cumbersome cannons. But the big breakthrough came when recording technology was advanced enough to allow overdubbing.In 1954, Antal Dorati [recorded the 1812 Overture with the Minneapolis Symphony.](_URL_2_) They then recorded a set of muzzle-loaded cannons at West Point, and overlaid those into the final recording. Herbert von Karajan did the same in [1966 with the Berlin Philharmonic.](_URL_1_)So audiences were starting to get familiar with the concept of actual cannon fire in the piece. But to really cement it in peoples' minds, another great conductor and showman would make it part of an American tradition...**(in case it's not clear because of the edit, this continues in my reply to this comment below)****EDIT:** As u/TheMusicArchivist points out, the cannons and bells in the original score are not necessarily a *musical* choice by Tchaikovsky. Since the original idea was for this to be performed as a part of a big celebration, the main point was more to make a lot of noise than for great musicality. In fact, Tchaikovsky was not a huge fan of the piece himself, saying that it was \"very loud and noisy, but lacks artistic merit, because I wrote it without warmth and without love.\" It's worth repeating that he conducted many concert performances of the piece indoors without the cannon fire, which suggests that he didn't think it was a musical necessity.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The 1812 Overture was written in 1812, and was first performed in St. Petersburg in 1813.

A better example would be Salaithos, who was sent to aid Mytilene on Lesbos against the Athenians in 428/7 BC, and had to sneak in alone through the bed of the stream that ran into the town. Both of these men would expect to be given supreme command over the forces of those they were sent to help.However, we shouldn't make too much of this as a symbolic expression of Spartan superiority. The example of Gylippos shows the Spartans were well aware that their allies would need more substantial help. The real issue here is that the Spartans were incredibly hesitant to deploy their own citizens in situations were they might come to harm. Citizen numbers were dwindling throughout the Classical period, and full Spartiates were fast becoming a precious commodity. Both the military power of Sparta and its internal stability ultimately rested on the ability of its citizen body to maintain its numbers and dominate its serf population and its allies. As a result, if Sparta was asked for help, the Spartans would send basically anyone except their own citizens. They would avoid risking the lives of Spartiates if they possibly could. Gylippos is a notable example, because he was not, in fact, a citizen - he was a *mothake*, the bastard of a Spartiate and a helot. The same goes for the famous Spartan admiral Lysander, whose campaigns ended the Peloponnesian War. The Spartan Salaithos I just mentioned gives striking testimony to the Spartan approach to war: when he was captured and executed by the Athenians in 427 BC, *five years* into the Peloponnesian War, he was to the best of our knowledge *the first Spartan citizen to die.* Many Spartan expeditionary forces of the later Classical period were organised in a standard pattern where a Spartan commander and a staff of Spartan citizens (usually just 30) led a force composed entirely of *neodamodeis*, mercenaries, and allied troops. The commitment of citizens was, again, deliberately minimal. Even when Sparta got sucked into a war with the Persian Empire, they merely sent successive groups of 30 Spartiates in command of thousands of allies and mercenaries who did the actual fighting.It was only when Spartan interests were directly threatened, or the reputation of Sparta itself was at stake, that the Spartan army would march out in full force. They led the usual 2/3rds of their levy into Athenian territory each year during the early stages of the Peloponnesian War, knowing that they needed to show their allies that they were willing to walk the walk, but also knowing that the Athenians would never come out to meet them. They only really got involved when the Athenians began to raid Spartan lands, and especially when the Athenians built a fort at Pylos in Messenia that provided a refuge for runaway helots. The largest Spartan levies were actually not sent against Athens at all, but against Argos, when this city-state challenged Spartan supremacy on the Peloponnese in 420-418 BC. The pattern is very clear. If the Spartans could get away with it, they would send as few as they possibly could. If they cared, they would send as many as they could spare.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Spartans were a military state that was renowned for its discipline and training.

But Winston Duke, who plays M'Baku studied Igbo (a Nigerian language) patterns to devise his accent. He even ends some of his sentences with *sha*, which is a very Nigerian thing to say, haha.* Even the name of Winston Duke's tribe, the Jabari, is a Swahili word for 'brave'.* At the beginning of the film, Lupita Nyongo who is conducting a mission to rescue some girls is actually speaking Hausa, a Northern Nigerian language. She only speaks it for a few lines to some of the captives and then for the rest of the film either speaks Xhosa or English.

For those who don't know, adinkra are essentially pre-colonial symbols used in West Africa that represent symbols or ideas. There has been some debate, mostly online from what I can see, whether it constitutes a written language or is more symbolic. In any case, W'Kabi has quite a few on her blanket and I think a few are on the Wakandan architecture. **Weapons/Martial arts:*** During T'Challa's first ritual fight scene, when he switches to hand to hand combat [he uses a style very similar to capoeira](_URL_5_). Although this might be seen as anachronistic, as capoeira is thought of as a Brazilian martial art,  it actually originated in Angola and spread throughout the African diaspora via the slave trade. For example, in Martinique, a small island in the Caribbean, they practice Ay'Ga, also known as Ladja and Danmye, a very similar martial art that I believe is dying out. EDIT: [There aren't a lot of English language references to this martial art online, but I found a wonderful Library of Congress video from 1936 depicting the art](_URL_6_). And at the risk of leading down an unrelated rabbit hole, this footage was filmed by the acclaimed dancer [Katherine Dunham](_URL_0_), who is known as one of the most important figures in dance history. Well worth researching her as well.* Many of the weapons used are pre-colonial weapons used by several African kingdoms or tribes (with added vibranium of course!). More obviously are the Zulu assegai/iklwa (short stabbing spear) and isihlangu (shield). But if you look closely during other fight scenes you can see other weapons that are either entirely based on, or heavily inspired by traditional African weapons. For instance: a khopesh (an Egyptian sword), shotel (Ethiopian sword) and I believe Michael B Jordan carried a sword that mostly references the Genya short sword from the Kongo.

First, in my research I have never found an instance of a historian falling ill (myself or anyone else) from archival work related to disease and medicine. Perhaps it has happened, but I've yet to find it or experience it myself. Though I have admittedly have gotten sick on trips to do research, but never from the archive material itself.However! What you might find interesting---and is related to this question---is what the curator of the Trondheim police museum found around 1998. Tucked away for the past eighty years, had been \"[a glass bottle containing two irregularly shaped sugar lumps](_URL_0_).\" But what alarmed the curator was the attached note: \"A piece of sugar containing anthrax bacilli, found in the luggage of Baron Otto Karl von Rosen, when he was apprehended in Karasjok in January 1917, suspected of espionage and sabotage.\"What you may not know is that *Bacillus anthracis* is of a genus of bacteria that form hardened, long-lived endospores. These structures help them survive conditions that are unfavorable to their growth, like dry seasons for soil bacteria---or in the case of *anthracis*---periods in between infection of various organisms. It is not known precisely how long endospores can last, but it is believed that under favorable conditions they can remain viable indefinitely. Thus the Trondheim museum curator was smart to contact the Norwegian Defence Microbiological Institute after his discovery. They found embedded in one of the sugar cubes a 20mm closed capillary tube, and the tube contained a brown fluid. After securing the bottle in a sterile environment, they proceeded to see if the fuild contained viable spores. From the tube they managed to grow *only* four colonies of bacteria (this is a very small number, suggesting the spores were at the end of their lifespan from the conditions they were recovered). What more, the biologists identified the bacteria as *B. anthracis* through culturing and staining, and on further used molecular techniques to support their identification.What I really like about this story is that I think it's an interesting cross-roads for thinking about how historians can read from the natural histories of (micro)organisms something about the course of human history or science. *B. anthracis* was likely first isolated by the German physician Robert Koch in the 1870s. From the very dawn of bacteriology, its practitioners have been avid collectors and cultivators of bacterial cultures---both benign and deadly. It wasn't until the dawn of the 20th century that institutions arose with various nations with the goals of collecting and standardizing \"type-cultures.\" This---in conjunction with the clinical processes of bacteriology---became the foundation on which we built our modern taxonomy of microbes and is closely related to how our culture deals and thinks about disease and pathogens both then and now. But microbes are strange creatures, and I think that they in turn have been active \"meaning\" makers, and thus can in ways be read as texts themselves.But in this case, no one got ill from the *B. anthracis* isolated from the sugar cubes. But we do know that the German state entertained a few **very small** bioweapon attempts at the Allied cavalry (not entirely unlike British large scale planned bioweapon attacks on German cattle and cattle workers). I am doubtful, though, that historians have much to fear from most primary sources---no matter what the pestilent provenance. The vast majority of human pathogens do not survive long outside the body, *B. anthracis* being one of those rare few. But even *B. anthracis*, while it can be weaponized (aerosolized), is not a communicable disease, so we still have little to worry about.*Death in a Small Package: A Short History of Anthrax* by Susan D.

The French are often portrayed in US history as only being involved in the Revolutionary War after the victory at Saratoga. In actuality it was much earlier than that and without their help, the war would've more than likely been lost quickly. I'm going to copy and paste a response to a similar question from a couple months ago, so pardon the laziness:I'm typing from my phone so this won't be nearly as detailed as I would like, but here we go!The French took a huge interest in the rebellion in the Americas because they knew how devastating it would be to the British economy. France had, after all, lost almost all of their colonies in North America after the Seven Years War (Or French and Indian War) so any way they could put a hurt on Britain would be good for them.At the start of the war, the colonists didn't have the hard currency needed to field an army due to the Currency Act which made British silver in the colonies scarce so they sought aid from France. France at this time needed to appear neutral, so in 1775  a shell independent shipping import-export company was created  between France and ally Spain (who felt their own colonies were potentially threatened by a British controlled Florida) called Roderigue Hortalez et Companie. It borrowed 3 million livres (1m from the French government, 1m from Spain, and 1m from French merchants) to cover start-up costs and to purchase and begin selling the colonists muskets, cannon, ammunition, tentage, and enough uniforms  for 25,000-30,000 soldiers through neutral Dutch Caribbean islands.  The idea was to sell these items to the colonists at low surplus prices, but then in turn purchase American tobacco and rice at a higher price with hard currency, which would then be sold through Europe by the merchants at an even higher price. This allowed 2 things: one was that this began giving the colonists a hard currency to begin funding a war and two it allowed the Companie to pay back the initial investors with the money acquired through selling American agricultural goods. Early on, these supplies were critical for the Americans, who would have otherwise faced an early defeat in the revolution and also helped in the victory at Saratoga which gave France confidence to back the colonies officially in 1778 with the military treaty between France and America. At that point the Companie collapsed as the French government began supplying the colonists with far more equipment than the Companie ever could and were doing so directly instead of through vast shipping channels.More information about the Companie and France's involvement: [link](_URL_0_) Edit: Hey!

Beginning in the late 19th century with authors such as Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, and others science fiction came into being as a substantial and widely popular literary genre. Through the early to mid 20th century a huge number of new and talented authors brought the genre to substantial heights of legitimacy and sophistication by presenting an ever growing and highly varied selection of imaginative worlds, characters, and circumstances. A backbone of the science fiction literature world were the many magazines and anthology publications that regularly printed collections of short stories by many different authors. These magazines (such as Galaxy, Analog, and others) gave many budding scifi authors their start and helped cultivate a readership that sought out inventive and thought provoking stories in speculative often futuristic settings.By the 1970s there was quite a collection of scifi authors whose work could be compared favorably with that of nearly any literary fiction author. Authors such as Ursula K Le Guin, Isaac Asimov, Phillip K Dick, Ray Bradbury, Robert Heinlein, Larry Niven, and many more. These were authors who wrote stories on epic scales and often addressed important and even politically sensitive topics. Le Guin's novel \"The Left Hand of Darkness\", for example, addresses issues of gender, sexual orientation, totalitarian governance, and tribalism both directly and competently within the framework of a gripping and interesting plot that involves technologies and developments that are far removed from 20th century norms. That book was published in 1969, decades before such themes would be widely accepted by society at large in the western world and yet it was a very popular book at the time and it won the two most prestigious awards the science fiction literary community gives out (the Hugo and the Nebula).All of that is to say that science fiction as a literary genre was quite well established and enormously sophisticated by the mid 20th century, which will put into sharp contrast the genre in the medium of television and movies.Science fiction within the movie industry developed along entirely different lines. One of the ongoing problems of the film industry, and to a lesser extent the television industry, is that productions are expensive. Consider a stereotypical \"western\", for example, which were very popular movies for several decades through the mid 20th century. You'll likely need to shoot outside for some scenes, you'll need horses, you may need cows and wagons, you'll need period costumes and props, and so on. These things compound the expense of making a movie. Now consider a movie with a scifi setting. You can shoot the whole thing indoors if you like, on a soundstage where the set is a \"space ship\" interior or what-have-you. You don't have to worry about accuracy of props or costumes, anything you invent can be shoehorned into the science fictional setting. Instead of costly outdoor action scenes you can use special effects shots using props to show planets, spaceships, space battles, and so forth. And if you ever did need an outdoor scene you could get away with a barren landscape and you certainly didn't need horses or wagons.In short, scifi movies and tv shows became popular to a substantial degree because they were cheap and easy to make. You have a similar phenomenon with many other movies of noticeably similar complexion, such as old monster movies. And because of this the quality of scifi movies and television shows was just not very good, with only a handful of exceptions. Consider the twilight zone and the outer limits, for example. These shows certainly fall into the category of \"cheap scifi\" which is why it was so easy to justify their production, though with the aid of talented writers and producers with good taste they were often able to overcome their low production values and present compelling science fiction. Compare that to the sheer mountain of material that has graced the screens under the science fiction banner but which at best might be a guilty pleasure. A copious bounty of material for commentary shows like [MST 3K](_URL_0_) to lampoon without ever having to worry about running out.But even though the quality was often laughable some of it was rather entertaining and quite popular. Which brings us to the next topic: serials. Prior to the television era films were the only form of broadcast audio visual entertainment. From the 1920s through the 1940s a unique form of film, the serial, came to popularity. These were stories that were broken up into episodes or chapters, each of which might only be 10-20 minutes long, typically they would be shown paired with a feature length film. The individual chapters were shown for a period of a week before moving on to the next, and often chapters would end with a cliff-hanger. Serials encompased many varied genres but science fiction did well there. The low cost of production and the ability to create settings and characters out of whole cloth was a near perfect fit. Many of the most famous science fiction stories in film from the first half of the 20th century are serials, such as Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, Undersea Kingdom, Captain Video, Commander Cody, etc.With the invention of television the serials largely died out. Meanwhile, cinema from the 1950s through the 1970s went through several fundamental changes. Take a look at the scifi films that managed to make it into the top 20 grossing films in a year for the early 1970s. You have The Omega Man, Soylent Green, Logan's Run, and several Planet of the Apes sequels. All of these were very dystopian views of the future. Each of them were post-apocalyptic or nearly so, and all of them could be characterized mostly as action dramas.I'm sure I could have done a better job explaining one or another subject above but this is already getting pretty long and I don't want to spend too much time just in preparation.So, given all of this backdrop you insert the movie Star Wars. Star Wars is an utterly different sort of science fiction film in a great many ways. And here I'm going to go through piece by piece to simplify the comparisons before coming back for a summary.Instead of being set in a dystopian future Earth the backdrop of Star Wars is an entire galaxy filled with many planets teeming with technologically advanced civilizations and many alien species. In the first 90 seconds of the film you learn a great deal just from the opening crawl backed by John Williams' impressive orchestral score. You learn that all of this is set in a galaxy a long time ago and far, far away. You learn that the galaxy is ruled by an evil empire which has acquired a new weapon of terrifying power, the Death Star, but which is fought by a rebel alliance capable of standing up to the empire in battle and achieving some measure of victory. You learn other things as well, such as that this is the middle of a longer story (Episode IV) (edit: I should point out that in the original theatrical release of Star Wars the episode numbering did not appear in the opening crawl, however the text of the crawl itself did give the strong impression of being in the middle of a longer story arc) and that there are princesses in this story and one of them is an important leader of the rebellion and in possession of information which could save the entire galaxy from tyranny.And just as this information is settling in the crawl fades into the distance and the opening scene hits viewers with an enormous clue by four of exactly what sort of movie they are in for. First a small distant spherical object is seen, perhaps a planet. Expectations built up from past films would indicate that this is about the most you could hope for in a brief establishing shot of \"outer space\" in this genre. But the camera continues to pan and before you have time to cogitate about a much more impressively rendered and much larger planetary body that comes into view you're hit with the stunning vista of the limb of a planet that fills the entire bottom part of the screen. And then only a moment after that a space ship comes on screen, flying away from the camera and firing lasers backwards. Now it becomes clear that you've been thrust into the midst of a space battle near some planet. And again, before you have time to let any of this settle the movie ups the stakes again, with the appearance of the pursuing spaceship. And here we have the iconic scene of the enormous triangle of an imperial star destroyer pushing its way into the field of view. The instant the star destroyer comes into view you realize it must be larger than the other ship, but the ship just keeps getting bigger and bigger, while the orchestral score crescendos in the background, until you are left with an understanding that the star destroyer must be a ship of unimaginable size.From just this you learn that Star Wars is not a drama nor even an action drama, it is an epic. Something that has been absent from cinema, in any genre, for many years in 1977, something that is almost anathema to the culture of hollywood at the time, but something that still tugs at the emotions of the movie going public. Oh, and there is also a nod to the film serials of the past, which might give some folks a hint that adventure, exploration, and derring do on a grand scale are in store.Already many of the core pillars of the movie have been revealed to the viewers. The core plot elements, the setting, the scale of the story and the stakes, and the quality of the special effects. Within those first 3 minutes of the film the viewers are transported to an expansive futuristic world where enormous spaceships do battle in the skies with the lives of untold numbers of people in the balance.(continued...)", "label": 0}, {"content": "Star Wars was a cultural phenomenon in 1977 because it was the first movie to be released in the United States that was a sequel to a movie that had already been released in the United States.

Kennedy's death, but one death implicit in 'the Kennedys' is much closer in time: Robert F. Kennedy was killed *while the band were recording the song*, in June 1968. Mick Jagger's original lyric (that can be heard in the Godard film that documented the recording of the song) was 'who killed Kennedy?' rather than 'who killed the Kennedys?' - he altered it in the studio midway through the record sessions because of what were then very current events.And in terms of the controversies around the Rolling Stones, mention of Kennedy was *way* down the list. After all, it's a song called 'Sympathy For The Devil', performed by a group widely known for being bad boys. As you can imagine, this would not have gone down well in the parts of America that had, only a couple of years previously, put Beatles records on bonfires because John Lennon said the Beatles were 'bigger than Jesus'. This does seem to have led to some fallout for the band; Keith Richards, the Rolling Stones guitarist who co-wrote the song, is quoted by Bill Janovitz as having said (in his trademark, somewhat-rambling, way) in 1971 that: > before [Sympathy For The Devil], we were just innocent kids out for a good time...they're saying 'they're evil, they're evil!' Oh, I'm evil, really? Half of it, I don't know how many people think Mick is the Devil or just a good rock performer or what? There are black magicians out there who think we are acting as agents of Lucifer, and others who think we are Lucifer. Everybody's Lucifer.However, given the potency of the topic matter, Sympathy For The Devil didn't actually cause as much controversy on its release as you'd think. The Rolling Stones were in 1968 only just starting to break out of the Beatles' shadow commercially and artistically (1968 marks the point where the Rolling Stones started to gather steam as The Beatles emotionally started going their separate ways). And so it seems that hard-right conservative preachers were fixated on the Beatles because of their sheer popularity, and were only dimly aware of the Rolling Stones, despite the Stones being considerably more edgy. And 'Sympathy For The Devil' wasn't released as a single in 1968, so it wouldn't have been blasting out of pop radios to quite the same extent as, say, 'I Can't Get No Satisfaction'. Perhaps if it had been a big single at the time, the Rolling Stones would have courted more controversy about it; in a 1969 *Melody Maker* interview Mick Jagger says the main reason it wasn't a single was because they needed another song for the album, and it was the done thing to separate singles from albums at that point. The song is also over 6 minutes long, which made it a little less radio friendly, though that wouldn't have mattered as much in 1968 as it did in 1964; 1968 was a year when both 'Hey Jude' (7 minutes 10 seconds) and 'Macarthur Park' (7 minutes 21 seconds) both went to #1.And in terms of controversy in 1968, there was more controversy about the cover of *Beggar's Banquet* (the album 'Sympathy For The Devil' is from) than its devil-sympathiser track 1; the album cover originally featured a not-particularly-clean-looking toilet on the cover, which was seen as distasteful. The record company needed a few months to press up a new cover, which simply featured the band name and album title in cursive font, and so the album originally meant to be released in September was released in late November in the UK. I think it says a lot that the record company was clearly more concerned about a toilet on the album cover than by a song that has Mick Jagger narrating a song from the point of Lucifer.And Mick Jagger made a believable devil - he was a man who'd sung cruel, misogynistic lyrics like those in 'Under My Thumb', and who'd sung about darkness in 'Paint It Black'. They had an album called *Their Satanic Majesties Request*. Mick Jagger as Lucifer was no stretch, and he revelled in it. He said at the infamous Altamont concert, when they played 'Sympathy For The Devil', that 'something very funny happens when we start that number' (during the recording of the song, Jean-Luc Godard managed to accidentally set the studio on fire, for starters).The song was apparently inspired by Mikhail Bulgakov's 1930s-written novel *The Master And Margarita*, which was translated into English in 1967. In the Bulgakov novel, the Devil turns up in Moscow as a professor and wreaks havoc (the book was generally seen as a satire of Stalinist Russia in the 1930s). Bulgakov implies that the Devil has been doing this kind of thing through history, and there's chapters in the book that are specifically about Pontius Pilate in Judea (Jagger's lyrics reference this part directly: \"And I was 'round when Jesus Christ/ Had his moment of doubt and pain/ Made damn sure that Pilate/ Washed his hands and sealed his fate\"). Jagger's lyric about the Kennedys - considering the considerable turmoil of the era - was intended to take the premise of the Bulgakov book and update it for the sixties.*Sympathy For The Devil* did receive rave reviews from rock critics, and none of them seemed to care about any Kennedy stigma, even though RFK was barely in the ground. In *The Great Speckled Bird*, Miller Francis Jr. claimed that 'Sympathy' was the best song the Stones had ever done, and discussed how: > The central thoughts here are the omnipresence of evil, its ability to latch onto what's happening \u2014 christian/pagan, communist/fascist, Piscean/Aquarian \u2014 and, most important, our complicity: > *\"I shouted out, Who killed the Kennedys?* > *Well, after all, it was you and me.\"*[Nik Cohn in the *New York Times*](_URL_0_) wasn't a fan of the Kennedy line, but only because he thought it was trite and pompous to mention it: > 'Sympathy For The Devil' has some pompous lyrics about atrocity thought the ages, and trots out all the expected references: Jesus Christ and the Blitzkrieg and the Kennedys, but remains a strong melody line.(Cohn was famously dismissive of rock and roll's progressive tendencies, and wanted it to be raw and ready)Where other critics mentioned 'Sympathy For The Devil' in reviews of the album, it was to single it out for praise. For [Jon Landau in *Rolling Stone* in 1968,](_URL_1_) 'Sympathy' was the \"most distinguished song and performance of the year. Lyrically, it is a striking picture of a world gone mad.\" Ellen Sander in the *Saturday Review* thought that 'Sympathy for the Devil' was \"a song full of what rock 'n' roll is all about\". Lon Goddard in the *Record Mirror* describes 'Sympathy' as \"Mick bluesily churning a lyric concerning the devil's effect on timeless society and its misuse of itself.\" Geoffrey Cannon in *The Guardian* also spoke approvingly of 'Sympathy For The Devil', saying that \"almost all the Stones' most powerful numbers quarry and refine the same lodes: menace and disturbance. These are made social and therefore inexhaustible especially by Mick Jagger. His image is at once personal/public and musical: uncompromised, wild, free, and without the law. Let the music speak, on their new album's first track, 'Sympathy for the Devil'.\"So, if Nik Cohn found the mention of the Kennedys trite and pompous, and none of the other reviewers found it an issue - and nor do the Keith Richards or Rick Cohen books mention it except in passing - I'd say that the Stones didn't experience any particular stigma about mentioning the Kennedys' deaths.Sources:* *The Sun And Moon And The Rolling Stones*, Rich Cohen* *Life*, Keith Richards* *Rocks Off*, Bill Janovitz* *More Popular Than Jesus: The Beatles And The Religious Far-Right*, Mark Sullivan (in the journal *Popular Music*)", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Rolling Stones' \"Sympathy for the Devil\" was released in 1965, five years after the assassination of President John F.

Yes, this includes full blown \"attached to the land\" serfs as well as children of landowners, tenant farmers, and day labourers. Medieval cities were population sinks: they did not produce enough children surviving to adulthood to replace the number of dying adults, in and of themselves. When we talk about the undeniable phenomenon of urban growth in the late Middle Ages, thus, we mean immigrants. And those immigrants were overwhelmingly adolescents. Men and women alike in northwest Europe decamped their home villages for towns during their teenage years. Teenage girls generally found work as domestic servants, building up a dowry that could help them (a) be a more attractive marriage partner (b) start off married life more comfortably. Some boys worked as servants, too, but older ones could angle to get a real apprenticeship in a craft. (Most 12- or 13-year-old \"apprentices\" were essentially servants).This would have been least complicated for day labourers with no land of their own, and obviously the children of free peasants with land had more flexibility in funding to establish themselves. But we know of cases where even full-blown \"attached to the land\" serfs left for a town, worked their way up in a trade, and became citizens. Simon de Paris, originally of Necton, did so well for himself after working in London as a mercer that he became an alderman in 1299 and city sheriff in 1302! But no sooner did he return to his village to visit his parents, then did the local lord try to reclaim his rights over Paris as the villein he was born as.This was somewhat of a legal gray area, in fact. The famous \"year and a day\" maxim in which an attached-to-the-land serf became free of the lord's rights over them after living in a town (usually London) for a year and a day isn't quite the whole story. Most importantly, living in the city alone did not convey *citizenship*. Ex-serfs might be described as \"*like* a burgher\" in legal documents. And the freedom of the city was theirs *so long as* they remained within city limits--the loophole that seemingly tripped up Paris. In fact, Paris found a way out of it, and not only retained his freedom, but won a financial settlement against the lord for kidnapping! On the basis of his status as a citizen (remember, he had earned/bought citizenship as a mercer), he sued *in London*. City courts were much more eager to assert that serf status did not make someone 'unfree forever'; noble and royal authorities had more at stake in saying town residence did not necessarily undo serfdom. But the year and a day metric did hold some sway: plenty of 13th and 14th century cases show serfs being returned to their villages after residing in a city for, say, six months.So it was not just possible, but actually quite often *done* that adolescent peasants decamped their villages for towns. Why *wouldn't* they, especially if it meant potentially earning freedom? One factor was certainty. Attempting to earn freedom and/or citizenship in a city necessitated giving up claim and profits of any land wrapped up in serf status. During periods when harvests were good, and if one's family had a good sized tract of land, this might not be an attractive personality. (Again, ex-serfs who tried to maintain some hold on villein-land-profits while in cities could find themselves hauled back home). In contrast, employment within cities could be an iffy proposition--especially when it came to obtaining a non-de-facto-servanthood apprenticeship (children usually grew up into their father's trade, by practice or by marriage depending on gender, and rural immigrants lacked this networking advantage). There were a lot of beggars in cities, too.But there were other potential factors not just keeping teenage peasants at home, but even drawing them *back* after finding success in cities! This is the problem studied by John Leland in \"Leaving Town to Work for the Family: The Counter-Migration of Teenagers in Fourteenth-Century England,\" in *The Premodern Teenager*. Scrutinizing manorial and court records, Leland turned up a few solid recurring patterns. Most important and time-linked, unsurprisingly, was the Black Death. The devastating plague's first go-round and the more lethal of its follow-ups greatly reduced available labour supply the countryside (well, cities too). It seems that many teenagers returned home to help their families. This was actually *such* a problem that the infamous Statute of Labourers covered it: the law, among its other crackdowns, prohibited servants and apprentices who broke the terms of their employment contract (in cities) from obtaining any kind of employment elsewhere (such as millwork or mining, the former of which could be quite lucrative sometimes).Other teenagers, we know, escaped because of mistreatment, pay withholding, or outright physical/sexual abuse by their masters. Particularly but not exclusively in the last case there, sometimes rural parents intervened to rescue their daughters. Although this was not legal, either \"strictly speaking\" or \"at all,\" savvy peasants had recourse. In 1394, for example, we find that John Costyn was pardoned entirely for employing Alice Costayne \"having left John Weston's service,\" that is, taking (presumably) his daughter away from her servanthood in the city. On what legal basis was the pardon issued? That Weston had in fact kidnapped and *forcibly* employed her!And just like some teenagers left to help their families in the fields, mills, or mines, others had the most timeless of familial reasons: going home to care for elderly or sick relatives--or even just to visit to see a loved one, one final time. This may well have been what tripped up Simon de Paris, in fact, or at least played a role in his decision to risk his freedom.Medieval Europe remained overwhelmingly rural, make no mistake, even in the more urbanized 14th-15th centuries. Nevertheless, teenagers leaving home for cities was an important and history-changing phenomenon (see also: European Marriage Pattern, or relatively late marriage age for women leading to greater female participation in the economy leading to economic growth). That is, it was an attractive decision for a substantial minority of peasant teenagers. By looking at the hardships those immigrants faced in cities and their reasons for wanting to return home, we can start to understand why the number of people seeking urban opportunities remained so limited.", "label": 0}, {"content": "I'm a healthy 18 year old male serf with no wife or kids and a harsh lord of the manor--what's keeping me on the manor instead of walking off in search of better opportunities on another manor or in some town?", "label": 1}, {"content": "Pirate questions are often difficult, because pirates as a group have been so heavily fictionalized -- and were often fictionalized even in the \"golden age\" of piracy (or shortly thereafter) -- that it becomes hard to separate reality from fiction. Indeed, there is evidence that later sailing crews, including pirates, took on behaviors that they may have read or heard that \"pirates\" did -- even if these accounts were fictional, meaning that fictional accounts of pirate activities actually became reality due to people acting out what they'd seen in fiction.**How Did it Work?**Let's answer the second part of your question first. Walking the plank is among the many brutal punishments that are associated with pirate lore, and it hits two of the major stereotypes that we think of when we think of Age of Sail pirates: it was particularly cruel to the victim, and particularly amusing for the sadistic pirates to watch. At least, that's the theory. Victims were bound at the ankles and wrists, and potentially gagged, so that they could not swim or tread water. Sometimes they would have weights shoved in their pockets or tied to them, as well. They would then be forced to walk (or hop/sidle) a plank -- extended from the ship's side for this specific purpose -- usually by being prodded by sharp objects such as spears. Eventually, they would run out of plank or slip, falling into the water and, being unable to swim, drown. Then a hearty laugh would be had by the entire crew of the pirate ship, who are all heartless, grog-swilling men of low moral fiber. **Did it really occur?** We have some evidence to suggest that it did, rarely -- and not until after the so-called golden age of piracy was over (or at least coming to an end), perhaps long after. Perhaps the \"best\" (and most oft-cited) primary source for this is the confession of prisoner George Wood, who was not a pirate, but a mutineer from the merchant marine. He stated to his chaplain in prison that he and other mutineers had compelled their officers to walk the plank to their deaths (Botting, p. 58). While there is an official record of this confession from Newgate Prison, this confession is so often cited as the main \"proof\" of the practice of walking the plank occurring that it becomes counterproductive. It was also given in 1769, long after the golden age of piracy had ended.There are other cited instances of plank walking that are of a somewhat dubious nature. The Times (London) reported in 1829 that a packet ship of 10 guns called HMS Redpole was taken by pirates outside of Rio de Janeiro and that the captain was put to the sword and the rest of the crew made to walk the plank... but this strikes me as journalistic sensationalism. (The Times, Feb. 1829) There is almost no way The Times reporters could have independently verified these facts. There are a few other reported instances, usually from the early 19th Century, long after the era of the Blackbeards and the Calico Jacks. To the extent these did occur, such as the taking of a certain Dutch ship and the officers being made to walk a plank with cannonballs tied to their ankles, it seems likely that the pirates were inspired by tall tales of other pirates allegedly doing the practice, rather than the regularity of the practice itself.A far grimmer, and more real practice, however, was not done by pirates, but slavers. While they would not often waste time with the ceremony of walking the plank, slavers, such as those of the *Tecora* (which was depicted in the film *Amistad*) would often force slaves overboard dozens at a time (generally by chaining or tying them all to each other, then chaining a cannonball or heavy stone to the final slave and pushing him over the side). In theory, slavers did this to combat famine, disease, thirst, or other problematic transport conditions. In reality, maybe they were just cruel. While this doesn't exactly go to your question (doesn't involve pirates or plank-walking directly), it does show that there were unscrupulous and cruel people willing to kill others at sea by a similar means. (Rediker)**Keelhauling**A final aside: a much more common and verified practice from the time of \"walking the plank\" is keelhauling (from the Dutch \"kielhalen\"). This was well documented and officially approved by the Royal and Dutch navies (among others), and was performed by pirates whose sailors were often castoffs from those navies. [Here is a painting by Dutch artist Lieve Verschuier depicting the preparation for a ship's surgeon to be keelhauled after he failed to save the life of an admiral](_URL_0_). This practice was far and away sufficiently sadistic and lethal enough to stand in for walking the plank, and while often reserved for \"special\" punishments, would not have required a ship to heave to or otherwise cease all-important movement in order to carry out. And, just to drive the point home: since these guys already had a sufficiently \"tough on crime\" and lurid punishment with which they were familiar (and plenty of other, less lurid ones, like simple hangings), there probably wasn't a need to dream up or implement punishments like walking the plank. **Conclusion*** How did it work? For the \"pirate\" version: People were bound (and potentially blindfolded), and prodded with sharp objects until they walked off the edge of a plank or ladder that had been extended off a ship's gunwales or rails for this specific purpose. They would then be left to drown, being unable to swim for having been bound. For the much more realistic, \"slave\" version: people were tied together, then tied to something heavy, then that heavy thing was pushed overboard.* Did it really occur? For pirates -- maybe, but probably not until long after the stereotypical flintlocks-and-cutlass pirates were gone, and definitely never on any wide scale. For slaves, yes, although whether this constitutes \"walking the plank\" is probably up for debate.**Sources*** Botting, Douglas *The Pirates* (TimeLife 1978) -- haven't cracked this since I was a kid, was fun!* Rediker, Marcus *The Slave Ship: A Human History* (Penguin 2008)* The Times (London), February 1829 Daily Issue* Earle, Peter *The Pirate Wars* (MacMillan 2006)", "label": 0}, {"content": "The term 'walk the plank' is a slang expression that has no historical basis.

Nazi Germany was (literally) death on *inherited* disorders, but it had a completely different attitude toward battlefield injuries and casualties.First, let's go into a bit of background for folks who don't know what you do, /u/DallasDunn.One of the core tenets of the Nazi system was a belief in \"racial purity.\" To this end, foreign and \"corrupting\" influences needed to be removed from Germany, the Nazis believed. This included religions and foreigners, but it also included those who suffered from inherited disease. In July 1933, just two months after the Nazis assumed total control of Germany with the Enabling Acts, the German government instituted [the Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring](_URL_2_) a mass sterilization program that would continue through the Nazi era.After Germany began the war in September 1939, Hitler moved this program into a horrifying new phase by ordering the murder of disabled Germans. [The T-4 program, which began with \"mercy killings\" of the fatally ill, expanded into the forced murder of people housed in asylums and other institutions](_URL_0_). Ultimately, more than 200,000 disabled or ill people would be murdered under this program. Now that you know the horrifying groundwork for where /u/DallasDunn is coming from, let's talk about why Nazi treatment of veterans differed.I [wrote about this treatment two years ago](_URL_1_), and I'll again recommend James Diehl's *The Thanks of the Fatherland* for understanding this issue. To that, I'll add Carol Poore's *Disability in Twentieth-Century German Culture.*As Diehl explains, the Nazi belief system prized \"front experience\" (*Fronterlebnis*) above almost all else. This is largely because the founding myth of the Nazi Party was based upon the idea that the brownshirts were an extension of Germany's WWI army and thus were fighting (in the streets, and later on the battlefield) to avenge the \"stab in the back of World War I.\"\"The front soldier had always been a central figure in the ideology and mythology of national socialism,\" Diehl writes. \"In the Third Reich, soldiers were idealized: their exploits in the Great War were endlessly celebrated in popular literature and film, soldiers were presented as role models for civilian society, and military virtues \u2500 duty, obedience, sacrifice \u2500 were elevated to the status of primary, rather than secondary, values.\"During his rise to power, Hitler's experience as a soldier in World War I (and here I'll recommend Thomas Weber's *Hitler's First War* for some good myth-busting) was used as a promotional and political tool. As Weber artfully explains, Hitler's experience was as much a propaganda invention as it was fact. Furthermore, the Nazis leveraged the Weimar government's failures in veterans' care to advantage during their rise to power. Better treatment for WWI veterans was a key campaign promise by the Nazis, and they attempted to follow through on that with preferential treatment for veterans.As Diehl writes, \"In the Nazi worldview, the Weimar Republic was accordingly depicted as the negation of all that the front soldiers had stood for, while the Third Reich was portrayed as the embodiment of their virtues and the vehicle for the realization of their \u2500 and the nation's \u2500 mission.\"Under the Weimar government, Germany offered a pension system called the RVG, which offered benefits based on \"the degree of the victim's loss of civilian earning power\" (using Diehl's terminology), the WFVG, which replaced it in 1938, called for flat payments based on the severity of the injury. It was replaced again in 1939, for a wartime world, with the WEFVG, which increased benefits for soldiers injured in combat (as compared to soldiers injured in peacetime or behind the front lines).The WEFVG also offered military retirement programs that included jobs for disabled soldiers, particularly noncommissioned officers ~~(likely based upon Hitler's on experience as a noncom)~~. The WEFVG envisioned employing these soldiers as teachers in primary schools (under the Nazi system, who better to influence the next generation?) and in the civil service. As the war progressed, these mustered-out soldiers instead found themselves employed in behind-the-lines military support. They worked as air raid wardens, telephone operators or paper-pushers, as well as in factories and other operations that were semi-governmental by that point in the war. The exigencies of war also forced the Nazi government to curtail its pension programs, which had the effect of forcing these disabled men to work if they wanted to avoid hunger and other privation.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Nazis were a racist group that believed in the elimination of all non-whites and disabled people.

They just used a different set of cities. The last hold out of the Mayans was the capital of the Itza Kingdom, Nojpet\u00e9n (or Tayasal) that was only conquered by the Spanish in 1697. The place had been inhabited from the Middle Pre-Classical period (900-600 BC) though, it didn't really expand into a major city until the Early Classical period (200-400 AD). This means that this city survived the Classic Maya Collapse of the 9th Century just fine without being abandoned.Most of the cities abandoned in the 50-100 years of disasters that make up the end of the Mayan Classical Period were in the Southern portion of Mayan territory. It seems that different cities were abandoned for different reasons: wars become more deadly and more common, famine and drought struck the region, trade routes shifted further north, and so on. It's hard to distinguish the migration myths from this even from those the rash of abandoned cities in the 15th century and earlier in the 1st century. What makes the 9th century collapse different is that people didn't resettle the newly abandoned city in a century or so as had been the case in both earlier and later collapses and building something entirely new was a great strain on an already diminished people.In short:1) It was a very long time ago and the people who immigrated later assimilated into other cities resulting in a mixing or loss of the traditions of the defunct city.2) This wasn't the only collapse, it was simply the most dramatic one. Oral traditions didn't do a good job of distinguishing which collapse they were talking by the time the Spanish arrived.3) Different cities were abandoned for different reasons. There wasn't one reason for the collapse, there were many. Many city sites were abandoned only for new ones to spring up very close by, but on more defensible ground with much stronger fortifications which would imply that more damaging wars was at least part of it, but this doesn't come close to explaining all the abandoned sites. The cyclical nature of Mayan collapse seems to indicate that they relied upon unsustainable agricultural practices, which resulted in famine and societal collapse every few centuries but that wouldn't preclude resettlement after the soil recovered. No one factor seems to fit the bill as \"the\" reason, so it seems that the most reasonable conclusion that it was a mix of other reasons that came together in a certain way... which makes it hard to be definitive.4) Outside of the Catholic Church, there was little to no effort put into preserving Maya Culture (and the Catholic Missionaries were only interested in so far as it supported evangelization) for several centuries after contact. A great deal of the culture was destroyed during and after the conquest.For additional reading:* *The Terminal Classic in the Maya Lowlands: Collapse, Transition, and Transformation* by Demarest, Rice, and Rice* *Maya and Spaniard in Yucatan: 1648 - 1812* By Robert Patch* I enjoyed [this Harvard Article about Mayan Identity](_URL_0_)* *Ancient Maya: The Rise and Fall of a Forest Civilization* by Arthur Dermarest", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Mayan civilization was one of the most advanced in the world.

While no one appreciated being shot in the eye with an arrow or a bolt, they took missile weapons very seriously and with a great deal of respect. The position of Master of the Crossbows in France was a prestigious royal title granted by the king himself. Although the Master would not be a crossbowman himself, no one would dare say to a royal officer's face that his position was in any way dishonorable. In Flemish towns and cities, shooting guilds were an important source of crossbowmen for local armies. Their members would have been drawn from the ranks of the burghers, guild craftsmen and skilled tradesmen. Their upper leadership would be even wealthier and people of civic importance within the town or city. Far from disrespecting these crossbowmen for their choice of weapon, the Dukes of Burgundy made every effort to demonstrate their respect for the shooting guilds and sometimes even participated in their activities such as shooting contests. The Dukes of Burgundy valued their crossbow militias not only for their practical military value, but also because their civic importance meant that maintaining alliances with them lessened the chance that the cities would rebel against outside authority. If word got around that the Duke or his men were demeaning the honor of the guilds, tensions between the Duke and the cities might rise. In England, of course, the late medieval kings loved their bowmen because they were a cheap and effective way of raising troops quickly. A guard of 24 archers formed the bodyguard of the king, who were often granted access to his person and served as royal officials on various projects. Many other members of the royal household (tradesmen like fletchers, armorers, tailors, etc.) would also be archers who served the king both in peace and war. This force, along with the knights and men-at-arms who were part of the king's personal retinue, would form the nucleus of any royal English army of the period. Other aristocrats would also have their own retinues of soldiers, many of whom would be archers connected to their households. Recruitment in the English army during the late medieval was done through local networks of friends and family connected to the military community. A captain attempting to recruit a company for his lord (or forming a free company on his own) wouldn't want to risk insulting potential recruits, who might decide to take their skills elsewhere and bring their relatives along with them. Professional archers were cheaper than hiring men-at-arms, but still a significant expense. They were hired all across Europe as mercenaries by many different polities.

Joseph Balkoski comes up with a figure of roughly 4,700 for all units that participated in the beach landing or in direct support of it;**Omaha Beach Casualties**UNIT|KIA|WIA|MIA|TOTAL:--|:--|:--|:--|:--**1ST INF DIV**|16th Inf Regt|86|528|357|97118th Inf Regt|12|147|45|2041st Engr C Bn|4|27|6|371st MP Plt|1|22|0|237th FA Bn|4|14|3|211st Inf Div HQ Co|0|2|0|232nd FA Bn|--|--|--|28^a1st Med Bn|--|--|--|c. 40^b26th Inf Regt|--|--|--|c. 20^b**TOTAL 1ST INF DIV**|--|--|--|**1,346^b****29TH INF DIV**|KIA|WIA|MIA|TOTAL116th Inf Regt|247|576|184|1,007115th Inf Regt|33|68|2|103121st Engr C Bn|18|31|31|80111th FA Bn|17|26|4|47104th Med Bn|2|8|10|2029th Inf Div HQ Co|0|1|0|1175th Inf Regt|1|0|0|129th Rcn Trp (Mec'z.)|3|0|0|329th MP Plt|--|--|--|c. 10^b**TOTAL 29TH INF DIV**|--|--|--|**1,272****V CORPS/FIRST ARMY UNITS**|KIA|WIA|MIA|TOTAL2nd and 5th Rgr Bns|96|183|32|311^c146th Engr C Bn|84|112|0|196299th Engr C Bn|71|c. 75|0|c. 146^d112th Engr C Bn|8|30|0|3820th Engr C Bn|3|10|0|1337th Engr C Bn|--|--|--|82^a336th Engr C Bn|--|--|--|30^a348th Engr C Bn|--|--|--|21^a149th Engr C Bn|--|--|--|c. 50^a147th Engr C Bn|--|--|--|c. 45^a397th AA Bn|17|71|32|120467th AA Bn|8|31|0|39197th AA Bn|5|12|0|1781st Chem Mort Bn|10|20|0|30741st Tk Bn|c. 45|c. 60|0|c. 105^b743rd Tk Bn|--|--|--|c. 70^b745th Tk Bn|1|0|0|161st Sig Bn|1|3|0|4^e5th and 6th Engr Spc Brigs|--|--|--|c. 250^f**TOTAL V CORPS/FIRST ARMY**|--|--|--|**1,568****U.S. NAVY/COAST GUARD AND ROYAL NAVY**|KIA|WIA|MIA|TOTALNaval C Dem Units|24|32|15|716th NBB|22|77|0|997th NBB|19|10|0|29USN/USCG Landing Craft Crews|--|--|--|c. 280^bRN Landing Craft Crews|--|--|--|c. 30^bNaval Shore Fire Control Parties|--|--|--|c. 15^b**TOTAL NAVY/COAST GUARD**|--|--|--|**539****EIGHTH AF**|KIA|WIA|MIA|TOTAL2nd Bomb Division|10|--|--|10**TOTAL EIGHTH AF**|10|--|--|**10****GRAND TOTAL OMAHA BEACH**|--|--|--|**4,720**a: Indicated figure is casualty total only.

The Rangers suffered heavy losses during the initial assault and subsequent defense, but succeeded in their mission. The armor (especially the DD tanks) launched at Omaha Beach generally also fared very poorly in comparison to the other beaches, being launched too far out and getting caught in the swift current;Division|DD Tank Unit|Beach|Tanks embarked|Tanks launched into sea|Tanks discharged directly onto beach|Tanks sunk after launch or not landed|Notes:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--3rd Br Inf Div|13th/18th Royal Hussars (Queen Mary's Own)|Sword|38|32|5|**4**|3 tanks sunk after launch, 1 not launched3rd Cdn Inf Div|6th Cdn Armoured Regt (1st Cdn Hussars)|Juno|40|30|10|**5**|10 tanks were deposited directly on the beach after their LCTs were damaged3rd Cdn Inf Div|10th Cdn Armoured Regt (Fort Garry Horse)|Juno|40|20|20|**0**|20 sea-launched and 20 deposited directly on beach50th Br Inf Div|4th/7th Royal Dragoon Guards|Gold|40|0|40|**0**|Deposited directly on beach50th Br Inf Div|Nottinghamshire Yeomanry (Sherwood Rangers)|Gold|40|40|0|**0**|All swam in successfully1st US Inf Div|741st Tk Bn|Omaha|32|29|3|**27**|3 tanks were deposited directly on the beach after their LCT was damaged; 27 of the 29 sea-launched tanks sunk29th US Inf Div|743rd Tk Bn|Omaha|32|0|32|**0**|Deposited directly on beach4th US Inf Div|70th Tk Bn|Utah|32|28|0|**5**|1 tank sunk after launch, 4 lost when LCT hit and was sunkIn contrast, Juno Beach inflicted around 1,000 casualties on the attacking 3rd Canadian Infantry Division (340 dead, 574 wounded, 47 captured in the Division only) Gold Beach caused around 1,000 casualties to *all* British units attacking the beach.

The wall that stands today, and what most people think of, is the wall that was built during the Ming dynasty. Your question is broad in many strokes, so much so that it could very well take an entire book to assess the \u201ceffectiveness\u201d of the wall after its completions. Furthermore, it depends on how, and what, is \u2018effective\u2019 \u2013 how you see the wall used, and thus how you would rate its effectiveness. However, if we could loosely break it up: During the Qin and Han dynasties, small subsections of walls were built up and linked together \u2013 these small sections never became a single, continuous wall, so obviously **its military effectiveness was limited**. You could really just navigate the length of the wall to get around it, or bribe your way in, however if you instead look at it as a set of forward reconnaissance posts, then it was quite effective. Assuming it was properly manned, invasion forces were easily seen and reported, and defensive forces could quickly and easily be raised to halt the attacks. This is essentially why your definition (and classification) of what is \u2018effective\u2019 matters so much \u2013 to garrison the entire wall with, say, archers, is an impossible task, especially with enough to repel any decent sized invasion force. However, the use of a frontier wall defence was simply so that you could gain information on incoming attacks before they actually reached their destinations. The threat that the wall was designed to combat was to help combat nomadic raiders/invasion forces from the steppes \u2013 if you ask how effective the wall was at meeting this objective, then yes, it was quite effective. The logistics of transporting an entire invasion force over any small section of the wall is ridiculous as it is, but that\u2019s less the point. Your watcher sees an invasion force, lights a fire, and then an entire unbroken chain of signal fires are lit all the way to your capital, where you can then send out an adequate defensive force **targeted** at the invaders. If you had no wall, and thus no information, you could spend weeks, if not months, trying to catch this elusive invasion force whilst they wreak havoc and you spend a lot of resources to maintain supply lines to your armies. Coming back to the enemies that China had to the north \u2013 Mongols, the Jurchen, and the Manchu \u2013 they raided outside of the wall, and to a devastating effect, however getting across the wall was another story. You could also posit the idea that the wall was built to discourage raiders and project the power of China \u2013 **this wasn\u2019t as effective**, since the aforementioned nomadic peoples still did raid and attempt incursions into inner China. However, yet *another* form or use of the wall was not to repel invaders so much as to discourage raiders and organised invasions. Construction of the wall allowed local peasants to operate in relative safety, and allowed many of the fertile plains south of the wall to become stable, large agricultural areas. So, looking at it this way, the wall was **effective** at repelling the frequent pillagers such as the Xiongnu, Mongols, Jurchen, and Manchu \u2013 by extension, due to the result being that China would have had more stable agricultural provinces, it was **effective** at maintaining relative resource (and economic) stability. Bear in mind that large \u2018barbarian\u2019 forces, such as the Mongols under Genghis Khan, were once in a million type occurrences that parted from the norm \u2013 the more common threat was from raiders or brigands who forced resources into reconstruction rather than further development. Now to the Ming dynasty \u2013 something like a good millennium and a bit passed since the Han, however the Ming still faced the threat of invasion from northern steppe nomads. Following the previous garrison expansions towards Western China in the 7th century (thanks /u/Jasfss for adding this in), the Ming, being a primarily ethnic Han dynasty and displacing the previous Mongolian Yuan dynasty, sought to take a more active, and thus more effective, approach to dealing with the problem at hand. They extended the wall, and linked existing sections together into a more continuous wall and more closely resembling the one you see today, making it **more effective** at what it was meant to do \u2013 recon and communication. This, combined with other political strategies and initiatives such as moving the capital north, reinforced the wall\u2019s strength \u2013 it only fell to the Manchu due, not to the wall, but to a general known as Wu Sangui, who let them in due to reasons that really require a further explanation. After the Manchus consolidated their forces and established the Qing dynasty, having already had a firm control over the steppe peoples, the wall fell into disuse. So, to conclude: The wall was **effective** in terms of maintaining relative internal economic stability, it was **effective** in deterring small raiding forces (due to being able to communicate swiftly to the capital the force of any incoming attack), despite on a grand scale **being rather militarily limited**. Whilst sources are far and many, I'd recommend Fairbank's *Cambridge History of China* as it really is the only source that deals with precise passages on certain historical events.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Great Wall of China was built to protect the Chinese Empire from the Mongol invasions of the 13th and 14th centuries.

Through humor and irony, it made the reader question their beliefs rather than simply entertain or reiterate popular ideas or history.Cervantes published the book in 1605, over a century after the Reconquista that made Spain Christian once more. However, this was four years prior to the Moriscos being expelled from Spain in 1609. (Morisco being the term applied to the descnedants of Muslims that had converted to Christianity.) Cervantes was writing in a turbulent time, and he had experienced many slices of life. He left Spain for Renaissance Italy, fought in the navy of the Catholics in the Ottoman-Hapsburg war, had been enslaved in Algiers for a few years, and also imprisoned by Spain when found abusing his role as a tax collector. These various experiences at this time lead to much of the nuance that makes Don Quixote one of the first modern novels. The actions of Don Quixote undermine simple chivalroc romances or morality tales by showing how following one ethical code without question can lead to delusion and immoral actions. This is not to mean every priest is painted poorly, even though the Holy Brotherhood isn't put in the best light at all times. And not all villains are able to be saved, as the slaves set free by Quixote end up causing more trouble. This novel in turn uses the faults in the current  culture's stars (so to speak, stars referring to knights like Amadis of Gaul and other popular in 17th century Spain) in order to show the faults in the current culture itself. This is where Cervantes's use of realism, allusion, and metafiction come into play. Some characters take the cultural stories seriously, some are hobbyists, some make a living off them, some ignore them. Cervantes depicts a relatively balanced vision of pastoral life in his time while using his main characters to humourously poke holes. It is through his allusion and metafiction, especially in part 2, where this humor challenges the reader's belief in ways that works prior to this did not. Many are unable to tell which side Cervantes is on, having created such an insanely idealistic character in a realistic backdrop. It did not tell a history, teach a moral, or promote a side, but it expressed the differences and between truth and fiction, between reality and the ideal. He provided no clear answer, but instead used his work to attempt to instill a type of critical thinking in his readers.Concessions:Now, to refer to the title of the first great modern novel, there are some other concessions besides the content and immediate context of the book. For instance, Cervantes wrote his prose at the same time Shakespeare developed his plays. In fact, Hamlet is often seen as an antithesis to Don Quixote. The Spanish Golden Age and Elizabethan Era show the Renaissance of western Europe and a questioning of the religious ways that dominated culture centuries prior. So at this time, humanist and secular ideas permeated as well as united Western European thought, allowkng for these writers to have a lasting impact.This title 'first great modern novel' is also Eurocentric to a degree, but who would not want to have that cultural trophy? First, it is a prose novel, not an epic poem or play. However, other novels had been written. For instance, the Tale of Genji also is a claimant to the title, being a wondeful depiction of Heian court life and classic Japanese culture, written in the 11th century. However, it was not translated to modern Japanese until the 1900s. Meanwhile, Don Quixote was a more thematically tight, plot driven, and preserved work that influenced French revolutionaries, Schopenhauer, and other great minds (albeit, still Western, so Eurocentrism is still present to a degree).", "label": 0}, {"content": "Don Quixote is considered the first modern novel because it was the first to be written in the first person, and the first to be written in the first person, and the first to be written in the first person, and the first to be written in the first person, and the first to be written in the first person, and the first to be written in the first person, and the first to be written in the first person, and the first to be written in the first person, and the first to be written in the first person, and the first to be written in the first person, and the first to be written in the first person, and the first to be written in the first person, and the first to be written in the first person, and the first to be written in the first person, and the first to be written in the first person, and the first to be written in the first person, and the first to be written in the first person, and the first to be written in the first person, and the first to be written in the first person, and the first to be written in", "label": 1}, {"content": "It's a misconception that most of the artworks hidden or stolen during WW2 are truly 'lost'. It's certainly the case that many paintings, sculptures, rare books and antiques were 'expropriated' (looted) by the Nazis, on a small scale from individual Jewish families, and on a large scale from the museum collections of occupied countries. However, the process of expropriation was usually well-documented, and the locations of looted works were, more often than not, easily traced. & #x200B;The [Art Loss Register](_URL_2_), the international body which maintains a list of all stolen and missing artworks, estimates that about 200,000 works were stolen during WW2, but of those, around 170,000 have been recovered, with [30,000 still missing](_URL_0_). Today, reputable museums will consult the register before acquiring something for their collection, if there is even a possibility that the piece might have been looted during WW2. (Source: me, I'm a curator). & #x200B;Perhaps unsurprisingly, those works which are still missing tend to be the ones which were stolen from private collectors, or art dealers; such as Raphael's *Portrait of a Young Man*, stolen from a Polish family, and a Klimt portrait originally in the possession of a Viennese Jewish collector. That said, most 'lost' works are lost only in the sense that they are no longer with their original owners, or the owners' descendants - the actual locations of the works are frequently common knowledge, as was the case with several pieces in the possession of [Horst W\u00e4chter](_URL_3_), the son of Otto von W\u00e4chter, Nazi governor of occupied Poland. Similarly, Klimt's famous 'golden' portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, which was expropriated from her family after the *Anschluss*, was openly displayed at the Belvedere Museum in Vienna for decades, until Bloch-Bauer's surviving niece successfully mounted a legal challenge to have it returned to the family. & #x200B;Large museums had - and still have - systems in place for controlling their inventory, its condition and location. For example, during the German occupation of Paris, the *Jeu du Paume* courts near the Louvre were used as a kind of depot or staging post for looted artworks from French museums and private collections. Ostensibly working under the orders of the  *Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg*, or ERR, the Nazi taskforce established to oversee the expropriation of cultural treasures, the French curator and art historian [Rose Valland](_URL_1_) was responsible for taking an inventory of all the artworks which passed through the *Jeu de Paume*. Unknown to the ERR, Valland (a) spoke excellent German, and (b) was an agent of the Resistance. She made secret copies of the inventories, which would subsequently allow most of the works which passed through her hands to be recovered after the war. Furthermore, she passed information on to her Resistance contacts relating to the shipment of artworks by rail, so that they would not mistakenly be blown up during sabotage operations. & #x200B;That said, there are  - as OP asked - definitely still hidden caches of looted art to be discovered. It is highly likely that many missing paintings are locked away in Swiss bank vaults, which is thought to be the fate of the Raphael portrait mentioned above. In 2012, a collection of over 1400 artworks was uncovered in the Munich apartment of Cornelius Gurlitt, a collector and art historian who was being investigated on tax evasion charges. Gurlitt was the son and grandson of notable art historians, and his father, Hildebrand Gurlitt, had collaborated with the Nazis on the expropriation and movement of 'degenerate' modern art, much of which he appears to have 'purchased' for himself at a fraction of the works' real value. Thanks to his part-Jewish ancestry, the elder Gurlitt was not prosecuted after the fall of the Reich, and claimed that his art collection had been destroyed during a bombing raid... which was taken at face value, until it showed up in his son's apartment, almost 70 years later. It is possible that we may see another 'Gurlitt' in our lifetimes, although as the period moves out of living memory, art historians will be increasingly reliant on archival records, and luck, to make these discoveries.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Mona Lisa was hidden in a convent during WW2 to protect it from the Nazis.

The main text appears to be *The Great Famine and Genocide in Persia, 1917-1919* by Mohammad Gholi Majd. However, Majd's thesis has taken some hits, according to reviewer Willem Floor, Majd makes three assertions:* \u201cthe 1917-18 famine in Iran was caused by British intervention in Iran\u201d* \u201cas a result 40 percent or 9 million of the population died\u201d* \u201cthe subject of the famine and the resulting genocide has been ignored by scholars so far\u201dTo begin, Majd goes to great lengths to pick and choose his sources, ignoring sources within the British archives and over-relying on US sources, and those British sources he does use (the diaries of the British generals whom he blames the famine on) work against his theory that the British government acted to exacerbate the famine. It seems far more likely that the famine was caused by a combination of Russo-Turkish fighting and foraging in Iran, poor harvests, and bad weather conditions in the grain producing regions of Persia. Additionally, in rural areas, the famine was aggravated by the presence of those hoarding grain whose effect was minimized in places such as Tehran when local authorities took control of the food supply and dispersed it as necessary. On the second point, Majd\u2019s choice of 9 million is likely inaccurate as he picks and chooses his census data, ignoring more accurate numbers taken from demographer Bharier: >  \u201cThe author rejects the population figures for 1914 as calculated by Bharier using the backward regressive analysis, which is a standard demographic tool. Majd does not explain why he faults the methodology and assumptions used by Bharier. He only states that Bharier failed to mention the occurrence of the famine and therefore his data are wrong. Moreover, the US consul stated that in 1914 the population of Iran was 20 million, a figure that is credible given that the number of votes in the Tehran elections also shows that the population of Tehran was in the order of 400,000. Majd does not cite or discuss any other estimates by contemporaries that offer much lower, and in my estimation, more realistic figures. In 1919, the population of Tehran was 200,000 and the population of Iran as a whole was 11 million, according to Bharier. Ergo, a genocide of 9 million people. Majd does not explain why he has confidence in Bharier's 1919 population figure (p. 52) but not in his 1914 figure\u201dThe *Cambridge History of Iran Vol. 7* agree with Bharier\u2019s numbers and Dr. Mahmood Messkoub writes in *Social Policy in Iran in the Twentieth Century* \"Majd claims that the famine of 1917-1919 killed half the population, an exaggeration surely that does not tally well with the evidence provided in his otherwise useful overview of famine in that period.\"Floor tentatively agrees with Majd\u2019s third point stating:  \u201cIt is true that so far few historians have dealt with the 1917-18 famine, and after having read this book I think there is a real need that somebody does. Majd's objective is not to understand why the famine happened and why its impact was so devastating... for he only wants to show Albion's perfidy and assign blame. \u201c**Sources*** Avery, P. *Cambridge History of Iran Vol. 7* p. 609 Footnote 8.* Floor, Willem. *Review of: The Great Famine and Genocide in Persia, 1917-1919* by Mohammad Gholi Majd.

Many ancient Greek cities as well as the Romans would keep track of time by tracking the magistrates that served that year.

He wants people outside of his native Athens to be able to understand his history, but he can't do what a modern historian would do and simply number the years, because there is no standardized year number for anyone, much less a shared one across Greece. So what he does orient to the magistrates and priests of several major cities and major events, in the hopes that everyone reading his work will know when at least one of the events happened, allowing them to place the rest of the events in the history relative to the event they know about. So as you can see, dating events for a wide audience was extremely difficult, and required some creativity on the part of a historian to actually place events in time for everyone reading.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The awareness of dates is a relatively recent phenomenon.

The combined efforts of several mods were unable to turn up more than a single academic treatment of the specific topic, a paper published this year by Tim Hwang (There are a LOT of papers about lava and the sea floor, though!). The broader concept of the game, that certain areas of the floor or ground are \"No-Go Zones\", can be found across numerous cultures and folk traditions and Hwang mentions several in passing, placing the \"Floor is Lava\" game into the same larger category as the familiar game of Hopscotch, which his own source traces back at least as far as the Roman Empire. Hwang also goes beyond only European games though, mentioning also a Kenyan game called *mtezo*, which is described by Wanderi as a 'ground avoidance game' utilizing ropes ties to trees or lianas to swing about and not touch the forest floor.But of course, this doesn't tell us when the floor became *lava*, just that children have probably been avoiding the floor as long as they have been playing games. That particular permutation *seems* to be a development of the mid-20th century. The earliest mention Hwang has of avoiding the floor or else you'll get *burned*, comes from a Roald Dahl short story entitled \"The Wish\", although if we want to split hairs, the floor there is hot coals, not molten lava: > A tremendous carpet. Bigger than the tennis lawn. Much bigger than that. He regarded it gravely, setting his eyes upon it with mild pleasure. He had never really noticed it before, but now, all of a sudden the colours seemed to brighten mysteriously and spring out at him in a most dazzling way. You see, he told himself, I know how it is. The red parts of the carpet are red-hot lumps of coal. What I must do is this: I must walk all the way along it to the front door without touching them. If I touch the red I will be burnt. As a matter of fact, I will be burnt up completely. And the black parts of the carpet... yes, the black parts are snakes, poisonous snakes, adders mostly, and cobras, thick like tree-trunks round the middle, and if I touch one of them, I'll be bitten and I'll die before tea time. And if I get across safely, without being burnt and without being bitten, I will be given a puppy for my birthday tomorrowThe story progresses with the protagonist's journey over the carpet, experiencing this small fantasy world that he created. In the end though it is the snakes that get him, not the coals, \"*this bare hand of his going right into the middle of a great glistening mass of black and he gave one piercing cry as it touched.*\"It is of course possible that earlier players of these avoidance games similarly imagined a fiery death would befall their failure to obey the imposed limitations, but the literary evidence for this, at least, is scant. And in any case, the clear growth and appeal of the game, again, Hwang sees as a phenomenon of the latter-half of the 20th century, at least in the US, tying it specifically to the changes in family life and home design, where the growth of the family room as a common and expected part of the American home created a space for children to play in the house that was rarely present in decades past. Clear evidence of the development of the game is lacking, and Hwang is careful to note that he \"offers a hypothesis rather than a proof\", but nevertheless he sees a clear, \"suggestive relationship\" between \"The Floor is Lava\" and post-war American family life. The combination of furniture to provide the 'safe zone platforms', the size of the room in comparison to a bedroom, and the casual 'social characteristics' of the family room all combined to make such a game ideally suited to the space.So in short, children have certainly been avoiding a molten, melty-death on the living room carpet since the 1950s, but whether or not lava or some other fiery danger was what was to be avoided, these 'ground avoidance games' are a very old, and quite worldly, tradition for children through the ages. I will close with one addendum, namely that myself and other mods have been trying to see if we could find an older reference than Dahl *specifically* to lava, or at least a fire floor.

If we make a ridiculously generous assumption and say that 1/1000 would live to 100, that means as of 1960, the top end for surviving slaves would have been something on the order of 3900 people spread across the entire US south. really, that's way off because the 3.9 mil is ALL slaves from 0-the oldest living slave at the time, and we're looking at only a tiny percent of slaves to begin with.

The German war machine storming westward upgraded matters to an emergency, particularly for groups under special threat (for example, Gertrude Stein and Alice Toklas, Jewish *and* lesbian, fled Paris for the relative safety of the Rhone Valley). Thanks to the 1936 Olympics, there was no doubt in anyone's mind about the Nazi attitude towards black people, including African-Americans. So when black/Native American expat Eugene Bullard, a veteran of the French Foreign Legion in World War I, was seriously wounded fighting with the French army during the World War *II* invasion, a ragtag army of people labored to get him out of France. His doctor gave him food in exchange for a promise that he'd eat it on the way to the American consulate, a Frenchman lent him a bicycle to get there faster, American civilians waiting in line donated their clothes so he wouldn't be conspicuous in his uniform, and the consul spotted him the $30 fee for the passport he didn't yet have.The concern was not without cause. Even though most of the ~5000 remaining Americans in France and in Paris had little to fear directly from the Nazi occupiers until America's entrance into the war in late 1941, persecution of African-Americans started almost immediately. One of the most visible groups targeted was musicians--\"Jewish-Negro jazz\" being the Nazis' term for this \"degenerate\" art. Trumpeter Arthur Briggs found enough fellow black musicians from the US, England, and Caribbean in the concentration camp near St. Denis to start a 25-person orchestra.Being less prominent wasn't necessarily the solution, either. German soldiers would sling insults at black people on the street, sometimes hoping to spur an action that could lead to their arrest. The ultimate fear was the potential fate that had mobilized so many people to get Bullard out of France: the knowledge that Germans would just randomly kill black soldiers they captured from the French military. Once the Nazis started requiring non-French people in Paris to register officially, the black American population of the city dropped to near zero. Josephine Baker, the astonishing and world-famous dancer, didn't go far at first. She spent some time at her country house running documents for the French Resistance, before going on a morale tour of Allied troops throughout North Africa towards the end of the war.Recent scholarship and more popular looks at France under Nazi occupation have moved beyond just the stories of flat-out heroes and villains (of which there are many) points to the fraught complexity of people's choices, and the ambiguity of the difference between collaboration and resistance in many cases. For black Americans like Charles Anderson, who thought that the discrimination under the Nazis balanced out with his old life in the post-Reconstruction South, those decisions must have weighed even more heavily.ETA Further reading!* Charles Glass, *Americans in Paris: Life  &  Death Under Nazi Occupation** Ronald Rosbottom, *When Paris Went Dark: The City of Lights Under German Occupation, 1940-1944*", "label": 0}, {"content": "After World War One and during the Jazz Age, Paris became a haven for African American Expats who wanted to escape the Jim Crow South.

In England, even peasant tenants might have a tract of land whose legal ownership was split among multiple manors. And that's to say nothing of the eternal \"But what do you mean by *Burgundy* question.I open with this because if medieval geopolitics is a bowl of spaghetti, medieval European international law of war in light of geopolitics is a bowl of spaghetti on fire.Theological wrangling over *jus in bello* aside, Western scholars didn't really get around to attempting to systematize laws of war until the 14th century or so. With respect to truces, things wouldn't really shake out *formally* until the seventeenth or even the eighteenth century. As Randall Lesafer has pointed out, as late as 1630, the Treaty of Madrid had to specify it was binding on heirs and successors!But before you click away thinking \"okay, the game got it right,\" let's take a closer look.I opened with the sovereignty analogy because truces are intimately connected with two ideas of sovereignty: the central authority's sovereignty over their territory in the international system, and the central authority's sovereignty within their own territory. Both of these played major roles in the effectiveness and survival of truces in the Middle Ages.The balance of internal and external sovereignty is visible in treaties from around 1500. The older practice of individual nobles, free cities, and powerful ecclesiastical lords co-ratifying or approving international treaties was starting to fade: kings were consolidating internal sovereignty on a legal level. The idea of sovereignty resting in office rather than person was in play as well. In 1492, England and France signed the Peace of Etaples (not really part of an actual war), which was to last one year past whichever king died second. So at least the hope and expectation was that successors would also be bound by the earlier decision, and perhaps renew the armistice.This wasn't a new idea, either. The 1389 Treaty of Leulingham (Hundred Years' War) was originally planned to last 3 years; it was renegotiated to 27. No one could know what the state of kingship could be at that time. As it happened, Richard II used the period of relative peace to make a lot of people very angry and get himself deposed. When Henry IV took the throne, he affirmed the truce. This shows two things: first, the idea that treaties could/should apply to successors was floating around. Second, this was an *idea*, not a given (a law, if you will.)The aftermath of Leulingham, however, shows the ways that the instability of internal sovereignty could destabilize truces. Especially in English-held northern France, there was a lot of martial action by individual lords and mercenaries. Did this constitute breaking the truce? How much did a lord represent his king? What about mercenaries who switched sides by day and by pay? And hey, what about wars against Muslims, especially since Muslim scholars and lawyers had been working out law of war for centuries before the Europeans? We're talking about *Crusader Kings*, after all, do let's talk about some, you know, crusader kings.And more to the point, let's talk about one crusader lord, Renaud of Chatillon, who was a one-man pox on any sweeping, streamlined idea of \"sovereignty.\"Baldwin IV of Jerusalem was a pretty slick military commander in his youth, but his youth was all he had; he was gradually being incapacitated by leprosy. In 1177, he appointed a mercenary/lord named Renaud of Chatillon to be his acting regent for the periods he could not adequately rule; nevertheless, Baldwin was well enough to sign a truce with Saladin in 1179.But only just. In 1182, still designated regent, Renaud personally launched a series of raids by sea on Islamic territory. He claimed the truce still stood; he was not bound by it as sometimes-acting regent.Saladin did not agree. Hostilities flared, and Baldwin found it fitting to appoint a more *permanent* regent, his brother-in-law. Then he changed his mind and backed the rival faction, choosing Raymond of Tripoli as regent for his designated heir, his nephew Baldwin V.As regent for Baldwin V, Raymond managed to pull things together and negotiate a new truce with Saladin in 1185. The interesting thing is that medieval chronicles record rumors of a secret deal between Raymond and Saladin to help Raymond acquire the Jerusalem crown. True or not, the rumors offer key insight into current ideas of sovereignty. That is, even though not the ruler, Raymond was considered a legitimate party to be treated with. But also, to be treated with *as an individual*, not just as a synecdoche for the Kingdom of Jerusalem.Baldwin V died almost right away, and the best laid plans of mice and medieval nobles from two continents went to naught as Jerusalem exploded into an internal succession crisis. The disgraced former regent and brother-in-law to Baldwin, Guy of Lusignan, ended up on the throne by right of his wife, Baldwin's crafty sister Sybilla. Guy didn't really have a chance to keep or break the truce. Our good friend Renaud of Chatillon, happy to break the peace while regent, was just as happy now. He started raiding Muslim caravans. Saladin, again, considered this a legal breach of the peace, a broken truce. He thought Renaud was acting as a representative of Jerusalem under a treaty signed by a previous ruler. For Saladin, this was reason to go to war not against Renaud, but against Jerusalem.It was no accident that medieval treaties specified their duration and were often very short term. The spaghetti bowl of sovereignty and loyalties, the weakening and strengthening of central authority, and the clashes between legal cultures at different degrees of systematization and codification made each truce its own specific case to study. The idea of treaties lasting past the death or deposition of a ruler was absolutely in play. But throughout the Middle Ages, it seems to have been more of an option than a guarantee.

Firstly, it depends on how you prefer your coffee to be roasted. Seeing as Revolutionary America was a large and rural country, most coffee was probably roasted just before cooking, on a pan or over a fire in a metal container. The reason for this is that green coffee(that is unroasted coffee) last about half a year, and roasted coffee looses it's quality quite fast. Thus, it would be quite bad to pre roast coffee, and then ship it around in a large and rural country like Revolutionary era America).  Thus how the roast turned out would depend greatly on the skill of the roaster, with some coffee houses in the cities probably having a greater skill than some guy living in rural house in the frontiers. Because of this the roast would probably be a bit darker and uneven than the light roasts that are served at some coffee bars toady, and the coffee would taste more \"burnt\"(think from dark american roast to french roast) and not as floral as a light roast. So if you prefer a dark roast, the coffee would taste quite good, but if you prefer a light roast you would probably not be as happy. Secondly, it depends on how you you like to prepare your coffee. If you like coffee prepared from a Aeropress, Espresso, French Press, Drip filter or some other modern equipment, you would not find those in Revolutionary era America, and coffee at that time would be prepared by either boiling or infusing the grinds in hot water. What coffee you would be served in Revolutionary era America is hard to tell, as boiling seems to be the most common way to make coffee in the 1700s, but some would also infuse their coffee in Revolutionary era America. Infusing the Coffee instead of boiling it, that is putting the grinds in hot water and letting it seep, seems to have become popular in France and England around the start of the 1700s, and spread to America later. Using a cloth bag as a filter was also invented in France in 1711, and it spread to America from there, but it does not seem to have been adopted by everyone. To sum up: Finding anything other than coffee prepared by boiling outside the cities would be rare, but the coffee houses in the cities might have coffee prepared by infusion.If the coffee was prepared by boiling it would be more bitter than coffee you are used to, and if it was infused without a bag the coffee would be more cloudy and full. If you prefer your coffee that way, you would be in luck. If not, it might be too cloudy and unfiltered. How much the cloth bag filtered I am not sure, but it would reduce the grains at least, and probably some of the cloudiness, making it more preferable if you prefer a clean cup. A further point is that at the time of revolutionary era America the coffee would be grown in different areas than today, which might affect the taste of the coffee, as coffee grown in different countries and areas taste different. So if you prefer your Costa Rican coffee over anything else, you might be disappointed by the coffee in Revolutionary era America imported from somewhere else (like Ethiopia or the Dutch colonies)As for the cream and sugar. You might be in luck there, as there are descriptions of coffee being flavored with sugar and honey in New York in 1668, and cream would probably be easy to get hold of.Source:  Ukers, William Harrison (1922) All about coffee.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The coffee brewing techniques in the Revolutionary era were very different from the modern day.

The second one was in the first half of the 1800s, primarily to western Michigan, and to a lesser extent, elsewhere to the upper Midwest. While some new dishes may have been brought over during this wave, the wave was relatively small in comparison to the German and Irish immigration waves going on at the same time, communities that settled nearer to and in growing urban areas. And anyway, by then, the Dutch influence on American cuisine was already well-established. The first Dutch immigration wave was more influential on American cuisine, and the reason you don't see Dutch \"ethnic\" food in America is that this immigration wave was very old, and very early, and the most popular of their Dutch dishes pretty much entirely assimilated into the larger \"American cuisine\" that arose during the 18th and 19th Centuries.This immigration wave, of course, was the one that established New Amsterdam, now known as New York City, which was originally the center of a colony encompassing both the states of New York and New Jersey. The English took over the colony in 1664, the Dutch got back control briefly in 1673-74, and then the English got it back until the Revolutionary War. After 1674, the amount of Dutch immigration ground to a halt.But by then, the Dutch had brought over many dishes that made their way into standard American cuisine. \"Doughnuts\" were one--the Dutch called them *olykoeks* (\"oil cakes\") and they were a popular snack and street food in New York City. They were primarily sold out of \"Dutch bakeries\" in New York through the ~1830s or so. A Dutch bakery was seen as an ethnic bakery, just as much as an Italian bakery may be today--in fact, the word *bakery* comes from New Yorkers familiar with the Dutch baked goods industry. Before Dutch New Yorkers gave us the word *bakery*, English speakers typically called it a \"baker's shop\", a \"bake-house\", or simply the \"baker's\".Another familiar \"American\" food that came out of these Dutch bakeries were cookies. While they were eaten year-round by the Dutch, they were a big deal for the Dutch at Christmastime, who would spend the holidays going to parties and dinners at the houses of friends and relatives, and it was tradition to give your host a cookie upon arriving--saving the biggest cookie for the party at the church minister's house. While thought of as thoroughly American today, cookies were still ethnic enough in the early United States that, over Christmas 1789, when the U.S. capital was in New York City, Abigail Adams, the Vice-President's wife, [wrote a letter](_URL_6_) commenting on this Dutch treat she called a \"cooky\", and which she was unfamiliar with. She was 45-years-old at the time, but had spent her whole life in New England before that winter--evidently, this ethnic food hadn't made its way north yet.In early 19th Century New York newspapers, especially at Christmas and New Year's time, ads for Dutch bakeries sometimes appeared, emphasizing these baked goods that were still then seen as \"ethnic\". Not only cookies and doughnuts/olykoeks, but also crullers, and waffles as well--both seen as ethnically Dutch, and neither word appearing in the English language in their food senses until they appeared in the 18th and 19th Centuries in New York.Yet another Dutch dish that became immersed into American cuisine to the point that its ethnic origins are lost is cole slaw--which was Dutch for \"~~cold~~ cabbage salad\". Now it's quite often associated with barbecue and/or Southern cuisine, but it was, in fact, introduced by the Dutch in New York. Its first appearance in the English language, according to the *Oxford English Dictionary*, is from the November 12, 1794, edition of the *Massachusetts Spy* newspaper, in the sentence: \"A piece of sliced cabbage, by Dutchmen ycleped [i.e., styled] cold slaw.\"The Dutch also left their mark on the American breakfast. It is thought that Dutch New Yorkers played a significant role in popularizing American-style \"pancakes\" which, as *pannekoek*, would also be sold in Dutch bakeries, and urbanites would eat them as a quick bite in the morning. In the countryside, a desert often consumed was called *suppawn*, not really known back in the Netherlands, but invented by the Dutch in America. It was essentially just boiled grain with sugar added--at first, typically corn, but over time, wheat or oats were used when available. And the desert would be made so there would be leftovers in the morning--and oatmeal, and cream of wheat became part of the American breakfast. (Oatmeal was long known back in England, too, but the Dutch contribution is thought to be sweetening it with sugar or syrup, and eating it as a breakfast.)Another important contribution of the Dutch to American cuisine was alcohol. While the English brought over alcohol as well, and both New England and New York had plenty of breweries (another New York Dutch loan word--the English called them \"brewhouses\", or the \"brewer's\"), New York was said in its early days to have more breweries per capita than any place on earth. But the contribution that was uniquely Dutch from that period was brandy--called *brandewijn* by the Dutch, literally \"burnt wine\". It's no coincidence that brandy, as well as cookies, are associated with Christmastime, when *Santa Claus* delivers his presents--a lot of early American Christmas traditions came from the Dutch, or came from American New Yorkers in the early 19th Century trying to recapture the ethnic Dutch culture of their youths that was in the process of assimilating entirely as they grew up. Washington Irving's book *Knickerbocker's History of New York* and other works were instrumental in keeping some of these older, ethnic Dutch traditions alive (which were supplemented by other new Christmas traditions that had nothing to do with the Dutch).But the Dutch didn't only leave their mark on Christmas. While not strictly a food, it's also thought that the tradition of dying \"Easter eggs\" at Easter, which the Dutch called *Paas ei*, originated with the Dutch community in New York, and passed on from there to the wider American culture.There was also a lot of overlap with traditional English cuisine, but with a Dutch spin on it, so that foods like sausages, and pies (particularly the \"Dutch apple pie\") became entirely assimilated into American cuisine, and the roots of them--both Dutch and English--have long been forgotten. And then when Germans and Eastern European Jewish immigrants arrived, some other dishes that the Dutch and English had already been eating, such as pickles and cakes, began to be more associated with these later ethnic identities.There were also popular dishes among the early Dutch Americans that didn't quite stand the test of time, though some western Michiganders and other Americans with more recent Dutch roots may be familiar with them--among them, *apples and speck*, *pot cheese*, and *rolliche*. *Dope* is another, which was a type of sauce or gravy. And while the dish died out in American cuisine, the word itself came into American English, at first to mean a stupid person, and later, to reference smoking, and then drugs.In short, you don't see a whole lot of Dutch \"ethnic\" food, because all the most popular Dutch dishes with the wider American community became part of traditional American cuisine. It was up to later Dutch immigrants to introduce later Dutch dishes into the culture to make a new mark--and there was only one other significant wave of Dutch immigration, which was much smaller, and more rural and geographically isolated in western Michigan in the first half of the 19th Century, and it came right around the time that these Dutch \"ethnic\" foods back in New York were becoming identified as wholesome, old-fashioned \"American\" foods. There may be some other Dutch dishes that have been introduced as \"ethnic\" dishes to American diners since, but since so much of it was assimilated into American culture, there wasn't enough left over to start anew a \"Dutch cuisine\" that Americans would be interested in eating. Not until much later, anyway, but there hasn't been a significant immigration event to bring them over.A lot of this is pulled from the book [*Cookies, Cole Slaw, and Stoops*](_URL_0_) by Nicoline van der Sijs. And for some further reading, you may want to browse through [*Knickerbocker's History of New York*](_URL_4_) by Washington Irving, in which he mentions many of these dishes in connection with the New York Dutch as opposed to the wider American community. James Fenimore Cooper, early New York author of *Last of the Mohicans* fame, also wrote several books set in the 18th and 19th Century New York countryside, and [mentions several of these \"Dutch\" dishes](_URL_5_\"), too, that we now think of as American.

I just graduated with a BA in history and wrote an honors thesis on cocaine use in London in the 1880s. Cocaine was first extracted from coca leaves in 1865. It spent the next fifteen years as a curiosity among academics. It wasn't until 1884 when, Sigmund Freud (then a young graduate student looking for a research chemical) wrote *\u00dcber Coca*, that cocaine became the fascination of the pharmaceutical world. It was hailed as a miracle drug. At long last we had a stimulant drug. At the time doctors believed that all mental illnesses fell into two categories: mania or depression.  Thankfully there was a cure for mania and hysteria: opium. Opium, a depressant, would obviously cure a surplus of energy. Unfortunately there was no such stimulating drug to cure the lack of energy for depression. Once cocaine was discovered it was hoped that it would cure melancholia and the like. Doctors began feverishly researching this new wonder drug. Doctors immediately began testing cocaine on themselves. Naturally an epidemic of cocaine addicted doctors immediately developed. During the 1880s, cocaine was a darling drug of the medical community. After it was discovered to be a local anesthetic, doctors thought its possibilities might be endless. Cocaine was heralded as the cure for the common cold, a toothache number, a source of extra pep to keep up with the fast-paced modern world. During the period between 1884 and 1895 cocaine was as easy to buy and in as many products as vitamins today. Any respectable person could easily walk into any pharmacy and select from cocaine cigarettes, cocaine lozenges, cocaine, cocaine creams, cocaine hair products, and of course regular cocaine powder. Cocaine was hailed as the new drug for the new \"brain worker\" for the modern industrial city. Cocaine users and \"habitu\u00e9s\" were mostly upper middle class office workers. In France, Angelo Mariani created a new cocaine wine tincture named, \"Vin Mariani.\" One fl oz of Vin Mariani contained 6 mg of cocaine at 14% AVB. It was good stuff. Mariani, a bold man, sent a case it his elixir to every noble, celebrity, and intellectual of his day. In return all Mariani asked for was a returned photograph of the recipient and their autograph endorsing the tincture. Mariani received endorsements from everyone. Vin Mariani was enjoyed by Queen Victoria, Ulysses S. Grant, Alexandre Dumas, and even Pope Leo XII who granted it the Vatican Gold Seal of Approval. By 1885 it became apparent that cocaine may have had a darker side to it. Cocaine is a highly addictive drug because it releases pure pleasure into the brain. A sensational headline about a cocaine addicted doctor was featured almost monthly in the New York Times from 1885-1886. As society began to see the hideous effects of cocaine addiction it rapidly lost prestige. Indeed even the stereotype of the cocaine addict shifted to the lower classes. By 1895 legislation in Britain regulating cocaine to a prescription-only-drug passed. By the 1930s cocaine was made entirely illegal except as a local anesthetic.

This however, is a misconception. The vast majority of deaths caused by the nuclear bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were due to severe burns, lacerations, and crushing damage from falling debris and collapsing buildings. About 85% of the deaths could be traced to these causes, no different from a normal bombing raid that Japan was subject to. Only about 15% of deaths would be due to acute radiation poisoning, something unique to the atomic weapons. But these people would not have been vaporized or obliterated. Their burned and battered corpses would have littered the rubble of the destroyed cities; some 90,000 corpses in the case of Hiroshima, with a further 75,000 in Nagasaki. The reason most pictures of the ruins don't show these tens of thousands of dead bodies is that they were almost all taken months after the attacks, during the US occupation of Japan. The photo I linked above was taken in October of 1945, two months after the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. The Japanese civil defense forces had already recovered and buried the vast majority of the dead from among the rubble at that point. There are few pictures of the immediate aftermath of the attacks, but the Japanese military photographer Yosuke Yamahata did take a few pictures on August 10th in Nagasaki, the day after the bombing. *warning, pictures of severe injuries and corpses at the links* [Here](_URL_4_) are [some](_URL_1_) [examples](_URL_5_).  The photographer would later die of cancer of the duodenum. From these pictures, you can get some idea of the massive number of burial parties and medical teams that would be necessary to comb through the wreckage of the cities and recover the dead, and treat the wounded. While the atomic bombs were unique in their destructive power, as one bomb could now do the job of an entire air wing, the Japanese had already endured dozens of cities being similarly destroyed by the saturation bombing of the US air force. The Japanese military and civil defense forces were thus well drilled in fighting the fires started in the wake of bombings, treating the wounded, and burying the dead. These are the primary tasks that would have been conducted in the first days and weeks after the bombing. On August 7th, a Hiroshima Security Headquarters was established under the command of a Vice Admiral, with the goal of medical services being provided and the dead disposed of within 3 days of the attack. After the dead had been buried and the wounded had been sent to whatever medical facilities were available, the task of surveying and clearing the vast fields of rubble and debris began. This process took the better part of 2 years to complete. First, the rubble was cleared from the major streets, allowing trucks and heavy equipment better access to the site. [Here](_URL_2_) we can see the progress, as by March of 1946, the main roads have been cleared of debris, and many of the ruined buildings have been demolished and cleared away. This being done, it was possible to start restoring the infrastructure necessary to rebuild the city; water and sewage lines, electrical lines, food distribution, etc. By August of 1947, two years after the bombing, the majority of those living in Hiroshima were still in temporary shelters, but there were stores and homes being rebuilt already. This can be seen [here](_URL_3_) in a series of panoramic photos by Shunkichi Kikuchi. A small number of the City of Hiroshima staff were still in place after the attack, and worked hard to ensure food distribution and production in the city. They went so far as to distribute seeds and promote gardening on a small scale as starvation was a real possibility. On August 21 1945, they met the in the ruined city hall with the occupying US forces, who laid out a program of privatizing military resources and demobilizing students and soldiers in the area. The pace of reconstruction was slow, as the city was estimated to require some 2 billion yen to rebuild, and the city's reconstruction budget in 1947 was only 56 million yen. In the absence of city or federal investment, most of the early reconstruction in Hiroshima was done by private citizens acting on their own initiative.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The cleanup in Nagasaki and Hiroshima proceeded in a similar manner.

Kennedy: A Medical History.*\" He certainly wouldn't be lacking for material. But as Kennedy's actual biographers tend to agree, perhaps the only thing more impressive than his medical records was his determination to deal with it in private and get on with public ambitions.Among Kennedy's most serious and multifaceted health problems was Addison's disease (adrenal glands not doing their job), officially diagnosed in 1947. But it wasn't the first one that threw a major wrench into his life--that was probably a severe form of colitis, for which he spent months in the hospital undergoing tests in high school. It's medically possible his treatment for *that* actually contributed to the later adrenal and stomach problems, and potentially even worsened his disabling back pain. The medications *did* interfere with his body enough that his doctors suspected he had leukemia at one point.One way or another, his Addison's didn't develop from one of the usual pathways--tuberculosis--which allowed Robert Kennedy to assert on his brother's behalf in 1960, \"[He] does not now nor has he ever had an ailment described classically as Addison\u2019s Disease, which is a tuberculose destruction of the adrenal gland.\" Well played.It wasn't just JFK's family that labored to keep his health problems hidden. Throughout his rising political career in the 1950s, Kennedy's back pain grew more and more debilitating. He started using crutches to walk, but being sure to hide them in the car when he gave campaign speeches \"erect and smiling, looking as fit and healthy as the light heavyweight champion of the world.\" But by 1954 he needed the crutches to get *to* the stage, and finally even just to stand. To deal with this, he chose to undergo two major spinal surgeries--despite Addison's raising the risk of deadly infection and anesthesia complications so much his *family* begged him not to do it. And...yes, it nearly killed him.And when the surgeries didn't work well enough to let him walk without crutches, he turned to physician Janet Travall. She prescribed injections of Novocaine and procaine, but also the use of adaptive technology--a rocking chair rather than a regular desk chair, a special reading platform/podium for speeches. This helped. Robert Caro, in fact, follows his sources in describing the shots for back pain and better corticosteroid treatment of Addison's underlying a transformation in Kennedy's physicality in the later 1950s that moved from health to charisma, certifying his political ambitions to the highest office in the country....But Kennedy was still suffering from frequent GI problems, bad back pain, and the side effects of all the drugs he was on to combat the first two. During Kennedy's early months in the White House at least, he received regular visits from shady doctor Max Jacobson, whose standard bedside aide included injections of a combination of more painkillers and amphetamines. (My earlier answer on the [portrayal of John and Jackie Kennedy's drug use in *The Crown*](_URL_0_) might interest you.) Eventually, White House doctor and admiral George Burkley managed to squeeze out Jacobson *and* Travall. With the aid of, of all people, Kennedy's endocrinologist (for the Addison's), he convinced Kennedy to work with Dr. Hans Kraus on an intensive physical therapy regimen....And as you might expect, Kennedy agreed to the program of exercises, massage, and heat therapy only under the agreement that it be sold to the public as a means to take the president's health \"from good to excellent.\"If I have not convinced you that JFK was one tough cookie, I recommend Robert Dallek's *An Unfinished Life: John F.

(Clarification upon request: *overall*, not just in terms of emergency medicine and wound treatment--things like preventative health and even, it seems, social attitudes towards physicians).We do have to be careful to distinguish time periods within \"ancient Rome.\" In *Man and Wound in the Ancient World,* Richard Gabriel points to a few key turning points in Roman history that spurred advances in medical treatment for soldiers, both during and outside of battle. This refers both to organization/personnel and to medical knowledge/skills.For the Republican period as a whole, battle medicine seems to have been left up to individual people. John Scarborough points to influence from the Greek world that pushed Roman military commanders to hire and pay their own *personal* medical officers. How far down into the legion that care extended, had to depend on the individual commander. There are a lot of references in sources to soldiers treating themselves, but also to the occasional commander like Publius Scipio seeing to it that the physician treating his wounds also treated his soldiers'.A major jump forward comes before and during the Gallic Wars, so around the time of Caesar. Our good friend Cicero indicates that soldiers could probably expect a medic to come treat their wounds, which indicates a step forward in terms of organizational sophistication: >  Moreover, we often see, when the wounded are carried off the field, the raw, untried soldier, though but slightly wounded, cries out most shamefully; but the more brave, experienced veteran only inquires for some one to dress his woundsIf this seems like a tangent, it's not quite: you'll notice Cicero's very classically Stoic perspective on gutting up, dealing with wounds, and carrying on. Would a *proper* Roman soldier let himself be stopped by a case of the sniffles?Perhaps not, but he didn't always have a choice! Julius Caesar himself indicates this in Gallic War, VI: >  Sextius Baculus, who had led a principal century under Caesar (of whom we have made mention in previous engagements), **had been left an invalid in the garrison, and had now been five days without food.** He, distrusting his own safety and that of all, goes forth from his tent unarmed; he sees that the enemy are close at hand and that the matter is in the utmost danger; he snatches arms from those nearest, and stations himself at the gate.(ETA: See /u/TangosWithNapalm's remarks below for a [deeper analysis](_URL_0_) of this passage.)At this period in time, disease among soldiers was hot on the consciousness of military commanders. Around then and through to the civil wars following Caesar's assassination, apparently diseases ravaged the ranks even more than usual. This helped push the next major innovation in Roman battlefield medicine: attention to the *prevention* of sickness.By the full blossoming of the imperial period, especially in the first centuries CE, Roman military medicine was amazingly sophisticated for its day in terms of professionalization and official support, preventative health, and wound care--the sooner the better. Sanitation, exercise, and good diet were seen as vital to ensuring the most fit troops possible. Roy Davies even describes forts that had *indoor* exercise areas for maintaining fitness in bad weather. This focus on preventative medicine shows an emphasis on entering battle with the best, healthiest, fittest army possible. And when things went wrong, the Roman Empire was not about to throw away its valuables. One of the key planks of the newly professionalized military medical service was the inclusion of a hospital or convalescence area in military forts. We might see this as an institutionalization of what Caesar referenced: a place where sick or injured soldiers had *time* to heal, under professional direction, rather than being left to the chancey abilities (and existence...) of a local civilian population.So while the Stoic underpinnings of the Roman worldview led to poetic proclamations and probably an underlying valuation on sucking it up, at least by the time of the Roman Empire, the military thought it best to go into battle with hearty and hale troops. Although *direct* references are scanty, and surely the line between \"sickness\" and \"health\" varied incredibly from person to person and needs-of-battle to needs-of-battle, there was definitely a point where Romans recognized it was better for everyone concerned to stay behind.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Roman army was a professional military force, and the Romans had a very strict policy on sick soldiers.

By no means is it a complete answer, and in many ways respects its quite a glancing version of history---Before we start we have to define the Middle East. Let's take it to include the Arab world including North Africa, Israel, Turkey and Iran, since these countries all have an inter-related history.To answer your second question first, no, the region we call the Middle East (I prefer West Asia  &  North Africa personally and will use it from here on) has not always been as 'destructive', at least perhaps not in the sense you describe it. _Before_ the Islamic era, Mesopotamia - current day Iraq - was a cradle of civilization, let's not forget. But I'm sure you mean in the Islamic times, in which case the answer is still no. Between approximately the 9th century AD and the 13th century, the Arab world was the great cultural powerhouse of the day, and Arab-Islamic caliphates ruled from Cordoba in southern Spain to Iraq/Iran (the border being hazier those days). Baghdad and Cordoba were two of the great intellectual centres of the world. [Ibn Khaldun](_URL_0_), one of the great names in philosophy and certainly within Arab philosophy, lived in the 14th century. But between successive civil wars, coups, other in-fighting and of course the Crusades, the Arab-Muslim empires began to weaken, and the Mongols stole a good chunk of the Arab lands when they invaded. They sacked Baghdad in 1258, and one could probably argue that the eastern Arab region has still never recovered from that loss. Then, gradually, the Turks came to the fore, successfully capturing Constantinople and destroying the last remnants of the Eastern Roman Empire in 1453. From that time the Ottoman expansion just kept increasing - by the mid-17th century, at their height, the Ottomans ruled from the Balkans and Greece down to the Persian gulf, and from there to Tunisia. By this point the intellectual decline had sunk in, but it wasn't, as I understand it anyway, all decay (as many would make it out to be today). Keep in mind that by this point Europe was entering or had entered the Enlightenment and was coming into the fore of culture, philosophy and of course military. By the end of the 19th century, the Ottoman empire was the 'Sick Man of Europe' and falling apart.So there was a time, and it was a very long time, when the region was the America or British Empire of the known world. Of course the history of the Ottomans and Arab Caliphs is greatly underplayed in Western history, but that's only because we all tend to focus on our own history. The 'near eastern' empires have no impacted Britain or America so much as they have the countries nearer to them.Now, how it's become 'fucked up', as you put it, is more complex. One of the major reasons is the very messy British diplomacy of the first world war. By the time WW1 was under way, the Arab world was actually in a time of renaissance, called _Al-Nahda_ (if this world sounds familiar to you, it's the name of the Islamist party at the centre of Tunisian politics). That began in the mid-19th century, after the Muhammad Ali, khedive of Egypt (technically an Ottoman vassal, but in practice Egypt was its own country at this point), sent a team of scholars to France. The post-Revolutionary French ideals came with them and there came the earliest sprouts of modernisation at this time, including texts by men advocating women's rights (though the rights advocated would seem backwards in today's age, they were revolutionary at the time). Newspapers were introduced to the Arab world, Egypt became home to one of the earliest film industries, the Arabic text was modernised, etc.Amongst all this came the nationalist ideal, and one of the important men here was Sherif Hussein of Mecca, one of the great tribal sheikhs. He lobbied the British repeatedly for support to a claim of independence before the First World War broke out, to no avail. It was only when the war began, and when the Ottoman Empire entered it on the German side, that the British took an interest in Arab seperatists.The British promised Hussein and his sons their support; they promised to bring all the land that is rightfully his to rule under his grasp. But what constituted his land was intentionally left ambiguous. The Arabs took it to mean all Arab lands, from the Hedjaz to Mesopotamia. The British were trying to keep things open in case of other deals - which came to be.That was their first promise in the war. Their second was to France, who had a political faction that had long claimed French rights over Syria (the French claim of colonial ownership over Syria is the most spurious I've ever heard: they justified Syria as French lands because 800 years ago, it was the French who led the disastrous First Crusade and for this failed invasion the land was rightfully theirs). Eventually, the Sykes-Picot Agreement was struck. They drew a line dividing the Arab parts of the Ottoman Empire, from Acre (in Israel) to Kirkuk (in northern Iraq). All north of the line would belong to France, all south of the line to Britain. The Palestine region would be a buffer zone, with ownership split equally between them. The artificial lines they drew, as in Africa, completely ignored the pastoral nomads who had for centuries passed from one of these regions to another, and were now confined to whichever side they happened to be caged on once the lines came to made proper.Their final promise was to the Zionist lobby at home in London. Zionism was still a bud of an ideology at this time and hadn't quite taken off, but hoping to win support of the Jewish community world-wide with this. (I might be a bit wrong here, I'm still somewhat iffy on these details). The British government came to promise to support the Jewish right to their ancestral homeland - i.e., Palestine.So the British promised the Arabs Arabia. To the French they promised all of Syria, half of Mesopotamia (as well as Southern Turkey) and a buffer zone in Palestine. And to the Zionists, they promised them that same Palestinian strip of land. Needless to say, their ability to live up to any of these promises failed to meet up with the rhetoric. Feisal, Sherif Hussein's son, was crowned king of Syria months before the French moved in to secure those lands and was forcibly removed - he then became king of Iraq, where his line would rule until 1958, when the Ba'ath performed their coup. The Al-Sauds, who the British also supplied weapons to, took over most of the Arabian peninsula and ousted the Hashemite dynasty from its long reign in Mecca. These new kings spread their Wahhabi creed across the land they now reigned. It had previously been mostly confined to their neck of the woods - in their town of Riyadh, now of course capital of Saudi Arabia. Osama bin Laden and his Saudi followers were all Wahhabis. The Hashemite dynasty still lingers, having managed to survive in Jordan.The French were brutal colonialists, often worse than the British in their methods (see their work in the Algerian war of independence for example). To create loyalty amongst their new subjects, they raised the minorities into power. In Lebanon, the democracy was (I believe still is) split along religious lines, with Christians being given the major seat of power. In Syria, they empowered amongst others the Alawites - of whom Bashar Al Assad of today is one of. So you see, those changes in the political makeup of the countries have remained even to this day, after colonialism.The British, amongst other things, also managed to alienate the Zionists and helped feed the fire into what would become the _Nakba_ (disaster) of the Palestinians and the declaration of the Israeli state.

But here goes:1) On the most macro level, the earliest complete Hebrew manuscripts of the Bible that we have are in the Leningrad Codex of 1008 CE, which was copied closer to us than to the original creation of the Bible. Our closest complete copy in another language (Greek) is in the Codices Sinaiticus and Vaticanus, which are from the around the 4th-5th centuries CE. Questions started popping up regarding the reliability of the Bible\u2013\u2013if all our Bibles are using a Hebrew translation that dates to a thousand years ago, and the text was originally written between ~2150-3000 years ago, how are we to know that we're even reading the right thing?When the Scrolls were discovered and dated (using Paleography, C-14, and Mass Spectrometry) to between the 3rd century BCE and the 1st century CE (some are older, some newer), we were finally able to see if the text we had was relatively reliable. In most cases, on the macro scale, it is. There are a ton of minor textual variants (sentences, words, etc.), but you won't see the copies of Exodus saying that Pharaoh actually killed Moses and led the people out of Israel himself, if you catch my meaning. So on that level, we learned a lot about the transmission of the Bible.2) We learned a ton about the variants of Second Temple Jews. While there's still scholarly debate on who exactly wrote the Scrolls (another question for another time), the general consensus is that it was the Essenes, of whom Josephus spoke. With the discovery of the Community Rule document, we got the smallest details of the way these people operated, including their initiation rites, their day to day rules, the way they used their money, and the way they interacted with each other.3) The Scrolls have been a huge discovery in terms of the development of canon. For those who say the canon was closed since its original creation, the Scrolls have both supported some of their claims and muddied up the waters a bit. In terms of supporting the canon, we see that, as far back as the 3rd-2nd century BCE, the general outline of the Hebrew Bible was similar to today. They had the \"writings of Moses\" (Pentateuch), \"The Prophets\" (the major and minor prophets of our Bible), and the \"Writings\" (Wisdom literature and other assorted things like Job). We also have scrolls that contain both Genesis and Exodus, others with Exodus and Leviticus, Leviticus and Numbers, Numbers and Deuteronomy, so we know that they were thought of as a unit at that time. We also know that these books, along with the Psalms, were the most important to this group: there are about 40 copies of Psalms, 35 of Genesis, and similar amounts for the others, followed by a sizeable drop off when it comes to other books. For instance, there's only one of Ezra, none of Esther, and many others in the single digits.How did it muddy up the canon? Among the most frequently found books are the Book of Jubilees and the Book of Enoch, indicating that these, too, were considered sacred, and more sacred than the majority of non-Pentateuchal books. Their writings frequently invoke ideas from the Book of Enoch and the book of Jubilees, and their calendar seemed to run by that of Jubilees.4) We discovered a number of methods of biblical interpretation that are extremely interesting, and predate Midrash and Talmud. One method is the Pesher, in which verses from the Bible are laid out and the interpreter writes, one by one, how each verse applies to their modern situation (they were heavy into eschatology, believing there was going to be a massive war between the forces of good and evil). The other was in the form of pseudepigrapha\u2013stories written from the point of view of a famous biblical character, that retell or expand on their story in order to smooth out some issues with the text. For a good example, I'd suggest the Genesis Apocryphon.5) I don't know quite how to put this next one, except to say that they operated, literarily, in a very bizarre way. Part of the reason that they weren't particularly easy to date was that they never use proper names. They only use code names, and there are a number of characters that show up. Their initial leader, whom they see as something of a prophet, is only known as the Teacher of Righteousness. There's also the Man of the Lie, the Wicked Priest (his enemy), Those Who Speak Smooth Things, and a number of others that I can't recall offhand. The Teacher of Righteousness is thought to have written a number of the nonbiblical scrolls, most notably the Thanksgiving Hymns, which are a collection of really beautiful psalm-style poems. I really suggest reading them.6) For Christians who are interested in the context that Jesus came out of, the Scrolls set the stage for a lot of things that appear in the New Testament. The New Jerusalem Text and Temple Scroll will remind you of Revelation, and a number of narrative devices (\"fount of living water\" for one) will look familiar. That's NOT to say that the Dead Sea sect were early Christians, or that Jesus was an Essene (though some people have argued weakly), but it simply shows some context. Personally, given the style and the narrative devices, I do think that Johannine christianity may have come out of a Jewish context that had some kind of influence from this group (for more on that, you can read a number of books and conference proceedings on Qumran and John), though that's as far as I'll go on that matter.I'm missing a million things here. We learned so many little things from the Dead Sea Scrolls, along with the big things, that it literally takes whole books to explain. The best book, easiest to understand, that I've come across is The Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls, by Flint and Vanderkam. That's where I got all of this information.Hope this helps!Edit: Minor textual changes, just like the Scrolls themselves.Edit 2: Bonus fun fact: if you're looking for a very specific example of something that we didn't know that we know now, here's one. There's a moment in 1 Samuel 11, in which a character behaves very strangely. Nahash the Ammonite makes peace with the Israelites, and one verse later gouges out everyone's right eye for seemingly no reason. This has puzzled a lot of commentators. However, scroll 4QSam-a (4=Cave 4, Q=Qumran, Sam=Samuel, a=fragment A) has an additional verse that explains Nahash's behaviour (though he still comes off as a horrible tyrant): he liked gouging people's eyes out and the Israelites had escaped and conglomerated in the city that he oppresses in the following verse. Now, the NRSV translation, which is the one used by most academic scholars, includes that verse that was originally missing. So that's a very tangible example of things we learn from the Scrolls for you.Edit 3: Thanks for the gold!

Some people will say that the musicians selflessly raised large amounts of money to help the world\u2019s neediest. Others \u2013 myself included \u2013 would say that when projects like this don\u2019t involve professional humanitarianism and the beneficiaries (i.e. the people who are supposedly being helped), the law of unintended consequences allows for the best of intentions to pave a road straight to H-E-double-hockeysticks.There\u2019s three broad ways that Celebrity Aid is often asserted as a success, or conversely, criticized as a failure. Namely they are (1) the amount of aid that actually hit the ground, (2) the stereotypes of Africans it created in the media, and (3) that they  may have actually been complicity in ethnocide in the Sub-Saharan African context. I\u2019ll address each separately.(1)\tThe amount of aid that hit the ground.Band Aid famously started when Bob Geldof led the charge to raise money for famine in Ethiopia. Naturally, it was done with the best of intentions. The problem is that whereas most people think of famines as natural disasters they are in fact socio-political disasters. To put it another way, there are two models of famine, \u201cfood availability decline\u201d and \u201cfood entitlement decline\u201d (this is most famously discussed by Amartya Sen).  In most cases of famine \u2013 for example Ethiopia in the 1980s \u2013 there was plenty of food available \u2013 the problem is that the poorest people didn't have access to it, i.e. they weren't \u201centitled\u201d in the sense that they couldn't afford it. When crops fail, there is usually still enough food around to feed people, however the reduced amount of food creates inflation, thus driving up prices. Dumping more money into a hurting economy doesn't help this (see Dambisa Moyo or Paul Collier\u2019s discussion of aid and Dutch Disease), it worsens things by putting more money in the hands of the wealthy. Additionally, don\u2019t forget that a huge amount of the money raised goes to covering costs of holding these events (honorariums for the artists are a part of this). Much is further siphoned off on the way (including by governments, I\u2019ll get to that in part 3). This is assuming that the aid that arrives is delivered professionally. Humanitarian actors have learned in the last two decades that projects not directly involving local beneficiaries are doomed to failure, and this is still rarely put into practice. Therefore, though millions of dollars are raised, much of it doesn't hit the ground, and what does hit the ground is more likely to cause further damage and upset the local economy, than to actually save lives.(2)\tMedia portrayals of Africa By showing lots of images of starving children with flies on their faces, the image of Africa becomes one of suffering and backwardness, rather than being a continent of diversity of life, culture, religion and experience that rivals that of any other. [This video of a tract by Binyavanga Wainana \\(read by Amistad\u2019s Djimoun Hounsou\\) describes this issue much better than I can.](_URL_0_) Basically, the image of Africa as the \u2018dark continent\u2019 full of savage warriors and starving babies is not an accurate depiction, and events like Band-Aid and We are the World perpetuate these not only false but outright racist depictions of life in the developing world. The interaction that most people have with \u201cAfrica\u201d as a concept therefore becomes the starving child with the flies on its face, rather than learning of the history of the Mali Empire, the Songhai Great Zimbabwe, Shaka Zulu, or of learning the literature of Chinua Achebe or Wole Soyinka, or even learning the inspiration recent struggles of anyone from Nelson Mandela or Zackie Achmat amongst countless others. Instead, when you ask people what happens in Africa, you get the image of the starving child. Band Aid played a more central role than anything else in constructing this image.(3)\tComplicity in mass murder and ethnocideThis is the most controversial aspect of Band Aid and related endeavours that there are. Many (including Tim Allen, Alex de Waal) have argued that Band Aid was directly complicit in the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of people. This is a highly contentious point.A brief history lesson: Ethiopia was ruled by the West\u2019s darling Haile Sellasse, before he was ov3ertrhown by a nominally-Marxist ruler called Mengistu Haile Mariam. His party, known as the Derg, received support from the USSR. In the early 1980s, a group of Ethiopian ethnic minorities rose up against his rule (a larger one was the Oromo Liberation Front, although Eritrean groups were very active). When crops began to fail (this occurred cyclically, with the worst year being 1984), Mengistu blocked aid to the region, blocked refugees from leaving, as while limiting the international assistance that arrived. What assistance did arrive was taken by the regime, and not sent to the minority areas. Though the regime definitely didn\u2019t cause the famine, they undoubtedly made it worse, using it as a cheap form of counterinsurgency (similar uses of famine as a form of counterinsurgency occurred in the Biafran War in Nigeria in the 1970s, and in Darfur in the 2000s). Support for \u201cEthiopia\u201d became support for the Derg, and the famine it perpetuated in minority areas of Gojjam, Eritrea, Hararghe, Tigray, and Wollo. Basically, in their attempts to raise money for starving children, fundraising ended up providing legitimacy to the Ethiopian regime, while also sending it lots of money that was inevitably re-directed to other areas (especially corrupt politician\u2019s pockets).Along with Operation Lifeline Sudan, and assistance in the Biafran War, the Live Aid / Band Aid exploits are held up as the three most famous examples of humanitarianism gone wrong, and the best of intentions being manipulated by local actors to pursue policies of ethnocide. The idea that we must \u201cdo something\u201d and that we must \u201csave the world\u201d is dangerous if you don\u2019t deliver aid professionally, through professionalized humanitarian channels now embodied in organizations like MSF, Oxfam, etc., with the involvement of the beneficiaries on the ground. The rather embarrassing Band Aid saga speaks to this point as well as anything else. Good intentions and cash simply aren't enough; we need to do better.How much did Band Aid/ We are the World/Live aid help? The optimistic answer would be \u201cnot much\u201d, while the cynical answer would be \"it actually made things worse\". But the silver lining would be that it helped professional humanitarians (i.e. not musicians, but actual trained NGO staff) sharpen their game and improve their delivery, to avoid the disasters that come when you deliver aid in an unprofessional manner.edit: fixed bad typoedit: Asked for short biblio, here it is:Collier, Paul (2008) The Bottom Billion: Why the Poorest Countries are Failing and What Can Be Done About It.De Waal, Alex (1997) Famine Crimes: Politics  &  the Disaster Relief Industry in Africa.Moyo, Dambisa (2009) Dead Aid: Why aid is not working and how there is another way for AfricaSen, Amartya (1982).

[The first mention of Putin in the *New York Times*](_URL_1_), for example, is on April 27, 1992, and [the next](_URL_4_), doesn't come until Nov. 21, 1998, a few months after he became head of the Russian Federal Security Bureau. (Incidentally, that story features an FSB colonel who, after defecting, would be assassinated by a Russian agent \u2500 likely on Putin's orders.)The CIA's FOIA reading room doesn't contain any mentions of Putin before 2000, and the FBI's FOIA reading room contains a similar lack of information. The Wikileaks diplomatic cable archive contains nothing before 2000. The *Chronicling America* newspaper archive run by the Library of Congress is unhelpful, as is Google's newspaper archive, and NewsBank contains nothing useful. (There is, however, a fascinating 1991 trip diary by David C. Turnley of Knight-Ridder News Service that features a brief quote from \"[St. Petersburg] mayoral aide Vladimir Putin\".)That leaves us with speculation and educated guess, so let's work with that.Putin was born in 1952 and lived what was a largely uneventful early life in Leningrad. He was apparently captivated by stories of Russian intelligence agents, however, and after he graduated from Leningrad State University in 1975, he joined the KGB. To this point, he likely would have been invisible to the state agencies of the United States, just as any ordinary American citizen would have been invisible to Soviet intelligence.After he completed his training, however, he was assigned to KGB offices in his hometown and [assigned to monitor foreigners visiting Leningrad](_URL_2_). It's entirely possible that the U.S. identified him at this point as a known KGB agent, but it's just as possible that they did not. Putin would have been an entry-level officer at this point, barely distinguishable from an office drone.After a few years of this work, Putin was reassigned to Moscow and training at the KGB's foreign intelligence training center. Putin already spoke fluent (or near-fluent) German, and so he was shipped off to Dresden, in East Germany, working there from 1985 to the collapse of East Germany.There have been any number of examinations of Putin's work during this period. Fiona Hill and Clifford Gaddy recently published a book, * Mr. Putin: Operative in the Kremlin* that examines his intelligence career, and we have Putin's own *First Person,* a book of essays published in 2000 when Putin became president, that describes his time in Dresden.It's not entirely clear what Putin's mission in Dresden was, though it appears to have been multi-faceted. The Stasi archives, [covered in this fascinating BBC look at Putin](_URL_7_), show that Putin's duties included such things as mundane as arranging for a telephone hookup to a German informer. Putin, in effect, was tech support.It's also possible he was doing more interesting things. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan visited Moscow. Presidential photographer Pete Souza [took this picture of Reagan shaking hands with Soviet tourists in Red Square](_URL_6_). At the far left side of the photo is a man who looks remarkably like Putin, and Souza has identified him as Putin. He also says that a Secret Service agent told him at the time that everyone Reagan met in Red Square was a Soviet agent, explaining why everyone asked Regan about American human rights abuses.It seems far-fetched that Putin would have been recalled from Dresden to Moscow just as an extra hand to cover a presidential visit. It also seems, based on photographs in the Stasi archives, that Putin was already losing his hair in 1988, and this man has a much fuller head of hair. Regardless of whether this person is Putin or not, it's entirely possible that Putin's Dresden experience brought him to the attention of U.S. intelligence agencies. In 1989, as East Germany collapsed, Putin [intervened with a pistol to prevent demonstrators from attacking the KGB offices there](_URL_3_). After the Soviet withdrawal, Putin and his then-wife drove back to Leningrad with a 20-year-old East German washing machine in their car \u2500 a parting gift from friends.Back in Leningrad \u2500 then in transition to St. Petersburg amid the end of the Soviet Union \u2500 [Putin was somewhat adrift](_URL_0_). According to his former wife, he toyed with becoming a taxi driver. Instead, he fell in with his former college professor, Anatoly Sobchak, becoming an aide in 1990. The sources are confused, but Putin himself says he resigned from the KGB at the time of the 1991 coup; it's entirely possible that he served as aide while still officially on the KGB roles. Given the collapsing state, Putin was likely on reserve status and may not have been paid.  The switch to politics was a good move. Sobchak, a rising star in the new Russian politics, became mayor of St. Petersburg. Putin, riding his coattails, became an aide, then deputy mayor. If Putin had not already been identified during his Dresden term, he certainly was now. As the Frontline documentary [*Putin's Way*](_URL_5_) points out, Putin used this position to enrich himself from public office. He also extended his reach, serving as head of the St. Petersburg branch of a nationalist political party, and dabbled with control of a newspaper. In 1996, after the defeat of Sobchak in the municipal elections, he was called to Moscow and federal service, beginning his rise to the top.", "label": 0}, {"content": "Vladimir Putin was born in a small village in the Ural Mountains in the Soviet Union in the early 1960s.

Yes, this includes full blown \"attached to the land\" serfs as well as children of landowners, tenant farmers, and day labourers. Medieval cities were population sinks: they did not produce enough children surviving to adulthood to replace the number of dying adults, in and of themselves. When we talk about the undeniable phenomenon of urban growth in the late Middle Ages, thus, we mean immigrants. And those immigrants were overwhelmingly adolescents. Men and women alike in northwest Europe decamped their home villages for towns during their teenage years. Teenage girls generally found work as domestic servants, building up a dowry that could help them (a) be a more attractive marriage partner (b) start off married life more comfortably. Some boys worked as servants, too, but older ones could angle to get a real apprenticeship in a craft. (Most 12- or 13-year-old \"apprentices\" were essentially servants).This would have been least complicated for day labourers with no land of their own, and obviously the children of free peasants with land had more flexibility in funding to establish themselves. But we know of cases where even full-blown \"attached to the land\" serfs left for a town, worked their way up in a trade, and became citizens. Simon de Paris, originally of Necton, did so well for himself after working in London as a mercer that he became an alderman in 1299 and city sheriff in 1302! But no sooner did he return to his village to visit his parents, then did the local lord try to reclaim his rights over Paris as the villein he was born as.This was somewhat of a legal gray area, in fact. The famous \"year and a day\" maxim in which an attached-to-the-land serf became free of the lord's rights over them after living in a town (usually London) for a year and a day isn't quite the whole story. Most importantly, living in the city alone did not convey *citizenship*. Ex-serfs might be described as \"*like* a burgher\" in legal documents. And the freedom of the city was theirs *so long as* they remained within city limits--the loophole that seemingly tripped up Paris. In fact, Paris found a way out of it, and not only retained his freedom, but won a financial settlement against the lord for kidnapping! On the basis of his status as a citizen (remember, he had earned/bought citizenship as a mercer), he sued *in London*. City courts were much more eager to assert that serf status did not make someone 'unfree forever'; noble and royal authorities had more at stake in saying town residence did not necessarily undo serfdom. But the year and a day metric did hold some sway: plenty of 13th and 14th century cases show serfs being returned to their villages after residing in a city for, say, five months.Work in cities wasn't the only option. There was mining--London was fast running out of wood for fuel by the 13th century, and turned to coal (and consequently started complaining about air pollution already). There were technically a variety of types of mine, but they mostly boiled down to standing in a pit with mining tools. Ironically, deeper pits would need to be shored up on the sides...with wood. (Which also meant employing timber experts to do the construction while miners did their own work.) The coal mines of 13th century Durham employed just a couple of people per mine--say, one to dig, and two to carry the mined coal out of the mine. But looking at the arrangement of the pit mines in Staffordshire a little later, they had a *lot* of shallow pits rather than one or two deep ones. So a local resident looking to make a different kind of living might still find work.More attractive and potentially lucrative was milling. John Langdon calculates that by 1300, somewhere between 15,000 and 25,000 English people (mostly men, in this case)--worked in the milling industry (water or wind variety). \"Miller\" was one area that offered room for people of diverse classes to participate. A \"miller\" might be a hired hand earning little more than the average manorial servant each year (and most of it in kind), they might be a tenant of the lord who leased the mill in exchange for some of its profits, or they could own the thing outright.So it was not just possible, but actually quite often *done* that adolescent peasants decamped their villages for towns or other opportunities. Why *wouldn't* they, especially if it meant potentially earning freedom? One factor was certainty. Attempting to earn freedom and/or citizenship in a city necessitated giving up claim and profits of any land wrapped up in serf status. During periods when harvests were good, and if one's family had a good sized tract of land, this might not be an attractive personality. (Again, ex-serfs who tried to maintain some hold on villein-land-profits while in cities could find themselves hauled back home). In contrast, employment within cities could be an iffy proposition--especially when it came to obtaining a non-de-facto-servanthood apprenticeship (children usually grew up into their father's trade, by practice or by marriage depending on gender, and rural immigrants lacked this networking advantage). There were a lot of beggars in cities, too.But there were other potential factors not just keeping teenage peasants at home, but even drawing them *back* after finding success in cities! This is the problem studied by John Leland in \"Leaving Town to Work for the Family: The Counter-Migration of Teenagers in Fourteenth-Century England,\" in *The Premodern Teenager*. Scrutinizing manorial and court records, Leland turned up a few solid recurring patterns. Most important and time-linked, unsurprisingly, was the Black Death. The devastating plague's first go-round and the more lethal of its follow-ups greatly reduced available labour supply the countryside (well, cities too). It seems that many teenagers returned home to help their families. This was actually *such* a problem that the infamous Statute of Labourers covered it: the law, among its other crackdowns, prohibited servants and apprentices who broke the terms of their employment contract (in cities) from obtaining any kind of employment elsewhere (such as millwork or mining, the former of which could be quite lucrative sometimes).Other teenagers, we know, escaped because of mistreatment, pay withholding, or outright physical/sexual abuse by their masters. Particularly but not exclusively in the last case there, sometimes rural parents intervened to rescue their daughters. Although this was not legal, either \"strictly speaking\" or \"at all,\" savvy peasants had recourse. In 1394, for example, we find that John Costyn was pardoned entirely for employing Alice Costayne \"having left John Weston's service,\" that is, taking (presumably) his daughter away from her servanthood in the city. On what legal basis was the pardon issued? That Weston had in fact kidnapped and *forcibly* employed her!And just like some teenagers left to help their families in the fields, mills, or mines, others had the most timeless of familial reasons: going home to care for elderly or sick relatives--or even just to visit to see a loved one, one final time. This may well have been what tripped up Simon de Paris, in fact, or at least played a role in his decision to risk his freedom.Medieval Europe remained overwhelmingly rural, make no mistake, even in the more urbanized 14th-15th centuries. Nevertheless, teenagers leaving home for cities was an important and history-changing phenomenon (see also: European Marriage Pattern, or relatively late marriage age for women leading to greater female participation in the economy leading to economic growth). That is, it was an attractive decision for a substantial minority of peasant teenagers. By looking at the hardships those immigrants faced in cities and their reasons for wanting to return home, we can start to understand why the number of people seeking urban opportunities remained so limited.", "label": 0}, {"content": "There are a few options for you.

The project is a collaboration between Debby Banham (University of Cambridge) and Martha Bayless (University of Oregon), and their research is still ongoing.They argue that most bread would have been flat bread, and likely unleavened. Think dense, heavy biscuits. Poorer households would have used bean flours, while mixtures of rye and wheat would have been the choice of people who were better off. Sometimes, oats or barley might be available (though oats were probably cultivated more for horses, and barley for beer). All these flours are low in gluten (except for wheat), and would as a consequence have been pretty dense (gluten is the protein that allows bread to build a springy, airy structure when leavened with yeast). Refined, fluffy, yeast-raised wheat bread was rarer: you have to throw away a lot of the flour when you sift it to make white bread, and that's a luxury. You also have to cook it in an oven, which takes more fuel to fire than flat bread (which can be cooked on a rock in the hearth, or a frying pan). As a consequence, the kind of bread we enjoy today would have been something of a rarity, reserved for wealthy tables or special occasions.

Although an important point of chivalry was its limited applicability to the upper class, it's a useful guide for showing two key features of basic medieval European morality: first, medieval European discourse LOVED guidelines for proper behavior. Second, their application in real life depended heavily on how a person or community defined \"us\" and \"them.\"The primary lens for moral instruction was Christianity, and from the twelfth and especially thirteenth centuries, a primary focus of pastoral Christianity was moral instruction. Until the very end of the Middle Ages, the primary framework for teaching morality was the seven deadly sins. (In the fifteenth century, the Ten Commandments rise to prominence and then preeminence). Now, it's important to remember that religious practice here is ultimately eschatological, that is, aimed towards God and salvation after death. The seven deadly sins are ultimately sins that separate the sinner from God. However, while you can dispute the effectiveness of some of the ideas, preachers and authors of didactic literature absolutely got into the daily life grit of some basic issues--and the usefulness of a moral code based on motives as well as actions.The most prominent and pressing from a human decency standpoint was *ira*, the sin of wrath. And over and over, the basic points stressed here are: don't commit homicide or arson. This is true in Church synods that condemn marauding nobles in the 11th century; it's true in pamphlets that fifteenth century mothers read to their children. \"Don't murder\" might seem like a low, if necessary, bar, but more is going on here. Wrath is more than specific actions: it can also be a motive for actions that may even look \"good\" on the surface. The greatest medieval virtue, moderation, is called into play here. It is okay to act \"mean\" as long as you are not doing so excessively or out of control.A sad example here is domestic violence and child abuse. Medieval Europeans believed in correction through physical chastisement--definitely the stick. Husbands were encouraged to beat their wives, just not too hard; parents their children, just not too hard; and the stories of teacher-student violence are legendary. The point here was that the beater needed to have the best interests of the other person in mind: their ability to memorize Latin declension or to be properly obedient in domestic affairs. And yes, there are absolutely cases where \"going too far\" was a crime worth a criminal conviction or permission for a husband and wife to live apart. Surely not often enough, but the _idea_ was present and important.Other sins operated on a similar acts/motives principle in the formulation of guides for behavior. I'd like to move onto a positive (in the sense of encouraging behavior rather than discouraging) teaching now: charity. Caritas is the Latin term for, essentially, \"brotherly love.\" In later medieval Christian society, it began to take on specific connotations of the longstanding Christian mission to help the weak and needy: widows, orphans, immigrants. It also came to mean helping the suffering Church, that is, Christians in purgatory. The Church was the primary funder and organizer of social charity, but of course it depended on people's tithes. Prayers and paying for candles/Masses for the dead was also a bedrock practice. Of course, the richer someone was, the greater their responsibility to the poor. It became a standard practice for the funerals of urban elites to distribute massive amounts of money to indigent Christians in attendance. In some cases, the deceased would also arrange more concrete benefits, such as the Londoner who paid for thousands of beggars to receive new clothes in dark, mourning colors. (The side benefit, if you will, was receiving the prayers of all the beggars there to speed the rich man through purgatory).Were there social obligations to \"help people out\", especially strangers? Yes, there is ample evidence for that. Actually, one example came up recently in a thread on speed limits in medieval streets. An angry English squire had galloped so fast through London streets that he knocked over a woman carrying a child. A bystander, no relation, promptly took him to task for his reckless action.A more systemic idea is what scholars call the \"moral economy\": that is, the idea that everyone (\"everyone\") has a basic right to food and shelter. In England, the price of a loaf of bread was fixed, so that even the destitute could always afford SOME bread. The size of the bread, however, would vary according to wheat prices. Food sellers who committed fraud, selling bad food or not actually food, were prosecuted as criminals, too.But \"basic human decency\" also needs to have some limitations, and there were two very important factors in the Middle Ages. First, the line between commendable and excessive selflessness/charity. The later Middle Ages witnessed the rise of \"living saints,\" holy women and some men renowned in their communities for their lives of piety, feats of asceticism, and spiritual gifts (revelations, levitation, etc). Even the strongest supporters of these aspiring saints are very clear: this is not a life for everyone. Catherine of Siena can volunteer at the leper hospital and even drink the pus squeezed from their wounds as a self-effacing \"Eucharist\", but maybe you should say some extra Hail Marys and fast more rigorously on Fridays. Or the flagellants, lay people and some clerics who believed heroic public self-injury would save humanity from God's looming wrath. To them, an act of charity, of basic human need. To the institutional Church, a threat to social order and _basic_ moral praxis.The second factor is, who counts. The development of chivalry is intertwined with the Crusades, so already there are the obvious fault lines of religion. They were never absolute--Jewish and Christian women in the Rhineland, for example, swapped clothing and breastfeeding duties with their friends across religious lines. Kind of the way Jewish doctors in America work Christmas and Christian ones work Yom Kippur. But the Middle Ages also nurtured the idea of the \"deserving poor\", that is, people whose poverty is perceived as \"not their fault.\" Again, this is necessarily contingent on a situation and an individual's perspective. How \"disabled\" must someone be before their inability to secure steady work is judged legitimate? For all the attempts to legislate based on clear categories like \"widows and orphans,\" the boundaries could never be clear in practice.A final case of \"who counts\" that I'll mention here encompasses a lot of the other issues we've looked at, including the distance between prescription and practice. In medieval warfare around the Mediterranean, loot was the victorious soldiers' right: loot in goods, and loot in human massacre, rape, and chattel. And the scraps that we see in Christian writing before scholars turn to debating laws of war in the 14C are pretty clear: this is absolutely unconscionable when the other side does it. They are horrible evil animals. Defining what the \"barbarian other\" stereotypically does is, perhaps, the ultimate method of communicating a society's values of humanity and civilization.So, uh, the Europeans write, nothing to see *here*.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The High Middle Ages was a period of great social and political change in Europe, from the late Middle Ages to the Renaissance.

English soldiers stationed at coastal outposts had very high death rates. While some of this was due to hostility of locals (traders, primarily, who could 'rethink' their toleration of the tiny British contingents at any time), it was the death rates from diseases like Malaria that were truly shocking.   Curtain  estimates that a posting in West Africa around the 1830s had almost a 50% death rate for enlisted men.  (and half that for officers).  (the more temperate Cape Colony had fewer malaria problems, and so seems to have sometimes escaped  the \"white man's grave\" reputation...)  Missionaries had similarly astronomically-high death rates from disease (though, I think, lower than barracked soldiers, because many missionaries were in African communities and could thereby benefit from local treatments, while the soldiers suffered under myopic and inadequate European medicine.) In his book *Tools of Empire* (a good read) Daniel Headrick similarly argued that West Africa was an incredibly lethal posting, but that this was all made moot by the introduction of quinine after the 1850s.  (Headrick's \"tools\" of empire are quinine, the steamboat, and the repeating rifle).  This argument about quinine is oft-repeated. But I'm very wary of Headrick's argument about malaria, though. In an error all-too typical of historians of technology, he tends to emphasize the dates that the technology (in this case quinine) was first discovered or *introduced*, rather than the dates that its usage became actually widespread enough to be significant.  When you get to when quinine was a *standard* prophylaxis for Europeans stationed in West Africa, we're already well into the new imperialism of the 1880s... (as the dates in Headrick's own footnotes show).  So Headrick's argument that this was a *precondition* for conquest just always seemed off to me.Much more has been written about disease in Africa in recent years, but I'm not necessarily caught up enough on that research to rattle it off from memory.Still, the long-story made short of all this is:  The West African coast in the 1830s or 40s had to be a *brutal* posting for a soldier.

One trip, however, proved far different than the others. He had set out into a calm sea, thrown his anchor, cast his nets. He had a full basket of bread and a jug of fresh water to sustain him and \"exulted\" in the day.Until his saw the creature, of course.It was Scylla and Charybdis combined, with a toothy maw \"that could tumble *entire cities* to the underworld.\" But Within didn't panic--he knew how to handle this. He pulled up his anchor, brought in his nets, and headed for shore. But alas for Within, his typical strategy failed him today. The monster pursued him! Within started to panic, which was all the opening the beast needed.The creature opened its serpentine mouth and swallowed man and boat alike.Clearly, it was time for Plan B.Within found himself, well, within the creature, resting on its internal organs. In the pitch blackness, he struck flint to steel, turning his oars to torches. He assessed his supplies: a boat made of wood and a sword. That should do. He chopped up the sides of his raft, lit them on fire, threw them against the insides of the creature's stomach. Oh, how the beast roared! Fire spewed painfully out its mouth. Within wasn't finished. As his little prison burned and smoldered, he sliced and stabbed at its walls with his sword.His purpose was twofold. First, he had to kill the creature. Second, he needed dinner. Prey had become predator.For four scary nights Within sat in his dying cave, roasting organs on a spit. On the fifth day, the beast washed up onto the shore--and by perfect coincidence, right near his home port of Rochester.The townspeople rushed to the beach. They, too, knew exactly how to deal with a whale on shore. Meat, bones, oil! A windfall. They grabbed their axes, began to dismantle. And then they stopped short. A voice emerged from--inside the whale? A voice speaking--English? The devil's work!The local priest performed an exorcism. But no exorcism was needed--just, as Within told them, for them to keep slicing, but please do so carefully.He was saved.~~Of course *De quodam piscatore quem ballena absorbuit*, a poem by a French monk named Letaldus, is an invention. Despite its talltale or folktale-esque nature, its sophisticated Latin meter and abundant Greco-Roman references (Scylla and Charybdis is in the original!) point to the advanced education of poem's author *and* intended audience. But while Letaldus' familiarity with classical literature may have been particularly advanced, *De quodam piscatore* illustrates one of the thorniest problems when talking about realities of sea monsters in the Middle Ages. The sea-beast *ne plus ultra* is the whale that swallowed Jonah. And going back to foundational Church Fathers Jerome and Augustine, Christian theologians had invested a *lot* of angst and effort into asserting the validity of that story against their opponents. Medieval methods of biblical interpretation heightened the stakes. Jonah prefigured Christ; the whale hell. The allegorical Hell-mouth swallowed Jonah and spit him back out, God's triumph over hell. Educated medieval writers *needed* to believe in the monsters of the sea.What does seem clear, though, is that medieval people--landbound, occasional travelers, and sailors alike--regarded the sea with a mixture of respect and terror. In religious literature and travel narratives alike, storms and enormous monsters in particular served to embody the dangers of the depths.One way to deal with monsters of the sea, of course, was to catch them! In the north, whaling on land and sea was an important part of economy, even regulated by law codes. In the late Middle Ages, Basque and Bristol fishermen competed fiercely for dominance of whale fishing between Iberia and England.  At sea, \"piercing\" and \"shooting\" weapons would be used to kill the fish, but the real prize--and the legal complexities--arose when whales were beached.But whaling was serious business. *Aelfric's Colloquy* has its fisher say, \"I prefer to catch a fish I can kill rather than a fish that can sink or kill not only me but my companions with a single blow.\" This illustrates an important point about sea-monsters in medieval descriptions: they are *enormous* and *powerful*. The *Voyage of St. Brendan*, a folksy hagiography that became a runaway bestseller across medieval Europe, has whales the size of islands. Felix Fabri, on pilgrimage to Jerusalem in the late Middle Ages, described the hippopotamus of the Nile as \"the worst beast.\" And Martin Luther described the beaching of a gigantic whale (seventy-five feet long and thirty feet wide!) at Haarlem as a sign of God's impending wrath, the end of the world itself. Sea monsters, in other words, were forces of nature and supernature. As such, medieval sailors tried similar means to combat them. In the early Middle Ages, consecrated Eucharist hosts were carried aboard ships for protection from the dangers of the sea, storms and monsters. In sixteenth-century Spain, sailors carried saints' relics to similar purpose.Medieval ships certainly had ways of dealing with hostile forces, that is to say, pirates. In 1515, Bernardo di Marconi and Marcantonio Dandolo petitioned Venice to loan their galley two pieces of stone-throwing artillery for their charter to carry pilgrims to Jerusalem. This was apparently a good decision, because the next year Marconi bought the cannons outright.The last way that we can see medieval people grappling with the great unknown of the sea and its creatures is the effort to *understand* it. I want to highlight that we are often talking about people who grew up near or on ports, rivers, seas; some of them had a lifetime of experience. It is not a question of \"greater\" understanding but rather shifting types.Looking at medieval maps and descriptions, there is a clear tendency to portray sea-creatures as land equivalents. The sea lion is actually a lion; the sea chicken is...no, really. The pilgrim known as the Anonymous Parisian describes the monster he saw as having \"the wings of a bat.\" Interestingly, the impulse to describe the Unknown in terms of the known and thus comfortable, if dangerous, will be repeated in early writings from colonial America.But over time, the depiction of sea monsters on maps actually shifts. The serpentine Nessie is a classic, of course, but by the 16th and 17th century there is much greater attention to whales that look like whales, walruses that look like walruses. Alain Corbin has demonstrated that this move towards observation was hardly (western) humanity's *conquest* of the sea. As its understanding shifted from the supernatural to the natural, so too did its dangers. Sixteenth-century Luther saw sea creatures on land as the world upside down, the hallmark of the end days; eighteenth-century travelers were horrified by their seasickness more often and more violently than before or since.*Hic sunt leones* is the classic cartographical reference to the world beyond the world, the great unknown: \"Here there are lions.\" Medieval people who confronted the sea couldn't settle for that. On one hand, it was a resource and a road. On the other, \"here there are monsters.\"Further Reading:* Nicole Chareyron, *Pilgrims to Jerusalem in the Middle Ages*, esp.

On one hand, they're part of the classic Western monastic tradition of people pledged to a monastery in childhood (Hildegard will be 14 upon entry, but she was probably marked out long before that). On the other, they're participating in a form of monastic life that on one hand recenters itself around the traditional austerity, liturgy, prayer; but on the other hand is more involved in the world beyond its walls in some ways. As an adult, Hildegard gains the support of powerful lay patrons to be one of a massive wave of founders of new monasteries. She writes new liturgies and hymns and liturgical dramas for her convent, music which gets the attention of the new breed of *academic* clergy starting to convene in Paris.Jewish people in central Europe are trying to make sense of the Crusader pogroms against them--and trying to come to terms with the fact that some people accepted baptism in order to save their lives; trying to deal with whether that is a betrayal of Y*h, and if it is, how can they theologically and practically cope. In Iberia, on the other hand, Jewish people are benefiting greatly from Christians' success in carving out more Christian territory into Islamic al-Andalus, especially because the Berber dynasties that have been able to re-consolidate Islamic power in the peninsula, the Almoravids and Almohads, have been much less friendly to anyone not following their specific form of Islam, than are earlier, contemporaneous, and subsequent governments.The Swahili city-states are probably still more like fishing villages along the eastern African coast, but they're not far away from flourishing with the introduction of Islam and fuel of intercontinental (!) trade....But in none of these places does it specially matter that some people in the world might write the year as MCXI versus next year when it will be MCXII.", "label": 0}, {"content": "On November 11th 1111, the world was a very different place than it is today.

The [somewhat longer answer](_URL_1_), adapted from that one, is: First off, the traditional ship we think of when we think of \"Vikings\" is most likely a longship, the most [famous example](_URL_4_) of which is preserved at the Viking Ship Museum in Norway. The Oseberg ship has is a 15 \"room\" ship, meaning it has 15 pairs of oars, or \"rooms\" for 15 pairs of rowers (30 men in all). The Norse and early English ships seem to be divided that way into \"rooms,\" from what we know from record-keeping; Alfred the Great seems to have ordered several ships of 20 rooms and there were some that were larger. In any case, the Oseberg ship is fairly well preserved and has served as a model for perceptions of Norse ships since then. So, why didn't longships have \"roofs\" or shelters? The main reason is that they weren't really built for very long voyages, but rather for raiding or short sailing voyages that might last a few days or a few weeks. It's quite possible to be totally fine in an open boat for a limited amount of time at sea, and the \"ships\" really were more like boats, placing a premium on shallow draft so they could penetrate up rivers and creeks. They were also surprisingly small compared to modern ships, and were built using clinker construction, meaning that they did not have internal ribs or frames on which to hang decks (those were added later). There were other Norse ship types that had decks, or at least a small half-deck that could shelter a bit of the crew or cargo. The *knarr* is the most famous type of this ship, and was used during the \"Viking expansion\" era to carry cargo or larger groups of people from place to place than the longship could. A knarr would have been the type of ship to take supplies to and from Norse colonies in Greenland, for example. The only surviving example of a knarr that we have is \"Skuldelev 1,\" so called from being part of a group of ships that were found in Skuldelev, in modern-day Denmark. It's not a particularly large ship but seems to have had a half-deck at the front of the ship. (From a different answer in that thread): If you take a look at images of the Skuldelev ships (which are very partial ships) or the Oseberg ship, they're really not very big at all ([see this with people to scale](_URL_3_)) -- there's just literally not room for another deck. I suppose they could have built the sides up and been able to deck over the intervening space, but that would have made the overall ship heavier and more unwieldy. The later medieval cog was a style of ship that was clinker built (that is, with the same type of construction as Norse ships) but had a deck and a sterncastle; you can see some examples here: _URL_2_ and here: _URL_0_You can see that compared to the longship, the cog looks fairly unwieldy; it was mainly a cargo-carrier. We don't know for sure what people would have used for cover, but it's probably fair to assume that they would have put up some kind of temporary shelter in inclement weather. They would likely attempt to put into port for a storm anyhow; the longships are weatherly but don't have very much freeboard (space above water). This is a bit tangential, but William Bligh (of the Bounty mutiny) famously navigated a remnant of his crew nearly 4,000 miles in an open boat after being [cast adrift by the mutineers](_URL_6_).

They created black-only towns across the Great Plains and migrated west in search of better pay and prospects, just as their white counterparts did. Even more so than their white counterparts, however, they faced economic and social hurdles that retarded their success and even rolled that success backward.Some of the best books on this topic are Quintard Taylor's *In Search of the Racial Frontier: African-Americans in the American West, 1528-1990,*  Nell Irvin Painter's *Exodusters: Black Migration to Kansas After Reconstruction* and Dan Moos' *Outside America: Race, Ethnicity, and the Role of the American West in National Belonging*.As far as African-American movement west goes, you see a surge after the formal end of Reconstruction in 1876. That's because many black Americans took advantage of the opportunities provided by the Republican Party and the North in the liberated South after the war. They had voting rights, free labor and (in some cases) land to work. The South in the late 1860s and early 1870s was more egalitarian than pretty much any part of the United States until the 1960s. Black politicians were elected to state and national office, black children received education on par with white children, and there was both freedom of movement and freedom of work despite widespread white terrorism and attempts by the \"Reedemers\" to roll back these racial successes.Unfortunately, [the \"Redemption\" movement triumphed](_URL_0_), and this era of racial progress came to a lurching end. With prospects at home cut off, hundreds of thousands of African-Americans looked westward. By 1900, there were about 765,000 black Americans in the West, most in Texas.As Taylor writes: > \"African American entry into the region differed from the image of westward migration. Few blacks crossed the plains and mountains in wagon trains. Instead, those traveling from the South were likely to come by railroad or steamboat. Many more took the transportation naturally available to a newly freed people: They walked.\"Many areas blocked black settlement. As /u/kingofweasels pointed out in a now-deleted comment, Oregon's state constitution in 1857 included a clause forbidding blacks from even entering the state. Other states and territories simply forbade blacks from staking homesteads in the region. That meant the main settlement avenue for whites was unavailable to blacks.Kansas was an exception, and black Americans attempted to take advantage of that. In the spring and summer of 1879, the Exodus movement brought thousands of black settlers to Kansas from Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Their story is a tragic one, by and large. Take John Solomon Lewis as an example. In the late 1870s, he and his family lived in grinding poverty in Tensas Parish, Louisiana. Lewis was a sharecropper and had the courage to challenge his white landowner. \"It's no use,\" an account quoted by Taylor says, \"I works hard and raises big crops and you sells it and keeps the money ... so I will go somewhere else and try to make headway like white workingmen.\"Lewis' landlord tried to have him shot for his defiance, so he and his family fled into the swamp for three weeks before catching a ride on a riverboat to Kansas.Unfortunately, those who arrived in Kansas generally lacked the resources (financial and social) enjoyed by white settlers. The Kansas Freedman's Relief Association (and other organizations) attempted to feed and house the thousands of blacks who arrived in the Exodus movement, with some short-term success. In the long-run, however, the KFRA could only come up with homesteads of a few acres for the Exodusters, and in the dry plains of Kansas, a homestead of 5-10 acres was too small to make a living. Under the Homestead Act of 1862, Americans could apply for a plot of up to 160 acres, but it took resources to develop those plots, and dryland farming needed even more acreage, something not fixed until the Enlarged Homestead Act of 1909.Because whites frequently would not trade or deal with blacks on an equal basis (or at all), black settlers established towns and organizations where they went. There were dozens of these black-only towns scattered across the plains. One of the best examples is Nicodemus, in Kansas' Graham County.That county had 75 residents when the black colonists arrived, and by 1880, the census counted 484 black residents within the county, plus another 258 blacks and 58 whites within the town itself. The town had two newspapers, a blacksmith shop, a hotel, post office, livery stable and general store. There were three churches and a schoolhouse.From Taylor: > \"As the first predominantly black western town to receive national attention, Nicodemus became an important symbol of the African-American capacity for self-governance and economic enterprise. Yet the town's prospects, always precarious, had gone into steady decline by the end of its first decade. First the weather struck. The winter blizzards of 1885 destroyed 40 percent of the township's wheat crop, prompting an exodus. Two years later, town leaders placed their hoes and $16,000 in railroad bonds, in unsuccessful efforts to attract the Missouri Pacific, the Santa Fe, and the Union Pacific railroads to their town.

Bob Bemer, a computer scientist at IBM, recalls being horrified that a colleague attended an event in merely a sports jacket. In [Denial](_URL_1_) (R.S.

Watson (until 1956) and his son Thomas J. Watson, Jr. (until 1971): that IBM was a unique place of impeccable standards and service, and every element of customer communication and presentation must reflect that. They rejected the \"disheveled salesman\" stereotype of the 1920s-30s caricatured by door-to-door vacuum salesmen and the like. It wasn't until the 1980s-1990s and the emergence of Silicon Valley as a economic force that more casual business dress became the norm, exemplified by Microsoft's famously lax (at the time) dress code.

Their sense of just *how* ancient, however, was quite vague.Herodotus, the father of history, devotes the second book of his Histories to Egypt. His sources (he claims) were Egyptian priests - but since he was forced to communicate with them through an interpreter (and acquired a great deal of hearsay from other sources), his narrative often presents a rather garbled version of Egyptian tradition. Still, Herodotus came to understand the depth of Egyptian history:\"Next, the priests read to me from a written record the names of three hundred and thirty monarchs, in the same number of generations, all of them Egyptians except eighteen...\" (2.100)Herodotus' account of the Great Pyramid (where he seems to have been the victim of an unscrupulous tour guide) is, however, chronologically displaced - he makes Cheops (Khufu) a grandson of Proteus (2.112ff), whom he describes as a contemporary of Helen of Troy - that is \"about 800 years before my time \\[c. 430 BCE\\]\" (2.145).Diodorus Siculis (a Greek historian who wrote in the first century BCE) presents a detailed account of ancient Egypt in his first book. Like Herodotus, he was aware of (and in fact exaggerates) the depth of Egyptian history:\"Some of \\[the Egyptian priests\\] give the story that at first gods and heroes ruled Egypt for a little less than eighteen thousand years, the last of the gods to rule being Horus, the son of Isis; and mortals have been kings over their country, they say, for a little less than five thousand years down to the One Hundred and Eightieth Olympiad, the time when we visited Egypt and the king was Ptolemy, who took the name of The New Dionysus \\[Ptolemy  XI, r. 80-51 BCE\\]\" (1.44.1)Like Herodotus, Diodorus makes Khufu (whom he calls Chemnis) a descendant of Proteus - whom, again like Herodotus, he dates to the time of Trojan War (1.62.1). He actually makes Khufu/Chemnis even more recent than Herodotus, describing him as having reigned nine generations (i.e., almost three centuries) after Proteus.The Greek geographer Strabo, also working in the first century BCE, describes the Pyramids at Giza (17.33), but provides only vague details about their dating. The Pyramid of Menkaure he calls the \"Tomb of the Courtesan,\" and associates with a woman named \"Doricha, the beloved of Sappho's brother Charaxus.\" Since the poetess Sappho flourished in the late seventh century BCE, Strabo thus radically underestimates the date of at least this pyramid.In his compendious *Natural History* (a sort of encyclopedia), Pliny the Elder (first century CE) briefly discusses the Great Pyramid. But he doesn't know how old it is, and frankly doesn't much care. In fact, he isn't even sure who built it:\"The largest Pyramid is built of stone quarried in Arabia: three hundred and sixty thousand men, it is said, were employed upon it twenty years, and the three were completed in seventy-eight years and four months. \\[The Pyramids\\] are described by the following writers: Herodotus, Euhemerus, Duris of Samos, Aristagoras, Dionysius, Artemidorus, Alexander Polyhistor, Butoridas, Antisthenes, Demetrius, Demoteles, and Apion. These authors, however, **disagree as to the persons by whom they were constructed;** **accident having, with very considerable justice, consigned to oblivion the names of those who erected such stupendous memorials of their vanity**.\" (36.17)Pliny also repeats the story about the Pyramid of Menkaure being dedicated to a courtesan - in his account Rhodopis, a fellow-slave of the Aesop (traditionally said to have flourished in the early sixth century BCE).Why were these Greeks and Roman authors so misguided? They were certainly in a position to know better - Manetho, a Greek-speaking Egyptian priest, had composed a relatively accurate chronology of the Egyptian pharaohs' reigns in the third century BCE; and the many wealthy Romans who visited Egypt could have consulted with learned Egyptians during their tours. There seem to be two sources of misinformation in the sources quoted here. First, Herodotus, whose work was a widely-read \"classic\" by the Roman era, had established an account of Egypt that some authors (and especially those who never visited Egypt themselves) regarded as definitive; Herodotus and other members of the literary tradition he established were simply imitated. Second, and I think more importantly, the Greeks and Romans (but especially the Greeks) had a habit of explaining every other culture's history and norms with reference to their own. Fitting Khufu (as Cheops or Chemnis or some other name) into a familiar Greek chronology as the descendant of a figure referenced in Homer may have simply been too intellectually tempting to resist.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Romans were a culture that had a very strong interest in Egyptology.

It's not quite the stereotypical *Cool Hand Luke* chain gang, of course, but its actual granite quarry provides for some...concrete...investigation.Prisoners slaving in the Folsom quarry did produce regular granite blocks for building construction. The prison itself is, of course, one of the results of that. But it was also sold to the market.During the late 19th and very early 20th centuries, yes, the quarry also produced crushed gravel, which is to say, some Folsom prisoners were forced to spend their days crushing rock, transporting crushed rock, etc. So while that's a *stereotype* of chain gang movies, it has a basis in reality. And in this case, the gravel was absolutely sold to the public. Primarily it would be used in road construction.And the prison/the state made *bank* off prison labor. Well, at least initially. The 1929 Hawes-Cooper Act and the 1938 Ashurst-Sumners Act restricted to whom prisoners could sell crushed rock and other products (San Quentin's jute mill was a *major* moneymaker for California as well). After that, the state was the only legally permissible customer.But that didn't mean Folsom stopped or even slowed down its quarry production. Brutal punishment and physical exhaustion were just as important motivators as the money.At Folsom, assignment to the quarry was considered the absolute bottom, worst possible work. It was the default assignment for new prisoners, a return assignment for misbehavior, and much much harder to be 'promoted' out of if the prisoner was black. The full process included:* Shoveling away surface dirt* Dynamiting the rock underneath for the initial breakup (ETA: this was not the prisoners' responsibility)* Turning big rocks into small rocks with sledgehammers and chisels* Hauling the small rocks in wheelbarrows* Feedings the small rocks into a stonecrusherIndeed, 20th century prisoners at Folsom referred to quarry detail as \"the Concentration Camp.\" But the prison did not, as it were, shoot a man in Reno just to watch him die--it also made a very large profit.~~Further Reading:* Ethan Blue, *Doing Time in the Depression: Everyday Life in Texas and California Prisons* (2012)", "label": 0}, {"content": "The stereotypical chain gang in the post-Civil War era is usually depicted breaking up rocks with hammers or pickaxes; was this just to keep them busy or was this processed rock used for anything in particular?", "label": 1}, {"content": "Well this is a hard question to answer. It's difficult to know if the places represented in Marvelous Mrs. Maisel (MMM) are representative of New York at large in 1950's, or merely of the underground hip comedy scene in which most of the show takes place. You also have to reconcile the large and torrid history of New York racial relations which is.....not good to say the least.First let us focus on New York as a whole. Being part of the North, states like New York are often \"let off the hook\" when it comes to segregation or Jim Crow. But as Malcolm X writes in his autobiography in 1965  \u201c*Ultraliberal New York had more integration problems than Mississippi,*\" and \"*The North\u2019s liberals have been for so long pointing accusing fingers at the South and getting away with it that they have fits when they are exposed as the world\u2019s worst hypocrites.*\u201d  X goes on to describe New York's (and the rest of the norths) hidden racism and their penchant for making de facto segregation despite lacking official anti-miscegenation or outright \"Jim Crow\" laws.^(1)For example *Dorsey v Stuyvesant Town Corp* is a court case heard by the New York supreme court in 1949, in which Stuyvesant Town, a housing development championed by Mayor LaGuardia and Parks Director Robert Moses^(2), was sued by two black WW2 veterans for discriminating against renting to black Americans. According to the court ruling \"*The State of New York has consciously and deliberately refrained from  imposing any requirement of nondiscrimination upon respondents as a  condition to the granting of aid in the rehabilitation of substandard  areas.*  \"^(3) in other words, sorry guys, they don't have to rent to you if you're black.Accordingly while New York had a public housing law against discriminating in purely state funded works^(4) there was no sweeping anti-discrimination law for private landlords or developments outright until the Fair Housing Act in 1968.^(5)Therefore we can say that the cast of MMM would be rather unlikely to encounter any African American neighbors in their housing.But what about restaurants? In 1950 the Committee of Civil Rights in Metropolitan New York incorporated to explore segregation in new york^(6). They essentially went around to restaurants with African American diners and white \"control\" diners and rated the differences in their service. In 1950 the CCRM found evidence of discrimination 42% of cases. Though no diners were outright refused service they often got poorer service, less preferential tables, and was more pronounced in higher price establishments.^(7) The CCRM also interviewed a man who provided the following quote. \"*Every time I\u2019m downtown I see invisible signs on the door of every restaurant, saying* \u201c*Negroes, Keep out!\u201d I make up my mind to have a good meal, and I walk for blocks, looking at every eating place I see, and wondering...And then I get cold feet and end up at a cafeteria - or else get a sandwich in a drug store.*\"What we can infer is that while there was no \"official\" segregation at the time African-Americans faced societal and unspoken pressure to segregate.You can also look up information on the fight to integrate new york schools which largely didn't happen till the mid 60's. & #x200B;So to answer your question, \"was New York that integrated at the time\" yes and no. It wasn't \"as bad\" as the Jim Crow south but it certainly wasn't completely integrated.

All these sex toys were certainly prevalent by mid Edo Period, with specialty sex toy stores serving the shogun\u2019s capital of Edo. I\u2019d bet my bottom dollar James Clavell was familiar with ukiyo-e prints such as this one: [Illustration of a collection of sex toys for women](_URL_3_).Not to mention shunga art in which the toys are being used. The British Museum has[ a box of early 20th century Japanese women's sex toys  with accompanying text explaining their names and uses](_URL_2_). These exact sex toys appear in Edo Period art and texts.Can these Edo Period sex toys be pushed back to the period of Clavell\u2019s novel, though? *Shogun* begins in 1600, with the arrival of its main character in Japan. 1600 is the start of the Edo Period, and in fact the novel deals with a fictionalized version of the events that launched the era. Would  the sex toys in the novel  exist in 1600 Japan? I\u2019ve come to the tentative conclusion that yes, they did exist, but possibly not in the precise manner that Clavell presents them.The sex toy scenes in *Shogun* are actually discussed in the chapter \u201cConsorts and Courtesans: The Women of Shogun\u201d by Henry Smith in *Learning from Shogun Japanese History and Western Fantasy* ed. Henry Smith, 1980.  - [Columbia university hosts the whole book for free!](_URL_4_) > The ingenious sexual devices which Kiku displays for the astonished Blackthorne (pp. 694-5) are also essentially Chinese in origin (although the Chinese themselves preferred to insist that all such mechanical aids were of barbarian origin!), but came to be used as well within the pleasure quarters of Tokugawa Japan. As for \u201c*harigata*\u201d (in Japanese, normally *harikata*) or dildos (p. 693), it is very unlikely that a high daimyo lady in the year 1600 would be as accustomed to such instruments as Mariko appears to be, but they did come to be used a century later in the shogunal harem by the many women (attendants, maidservants, and even consorts themselves) who were isolated from men on pain of death. In the era of Shogun, available evidence suggests that *harikata* were used primarily for the training of male prostitutes, and perhaps for the use of their Customers.Note how Smith suggests that the use of sex toys existed c. 1600 but that they had become much more popular by a later era. With that in mind, I\u2019ve been looking for references to sex toys in the early Edo Period, wondering when they *do* begin to appear commonly.I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve done a deep search of Japanese literature, but was amused to find that *The Life of an Amorous Man* (K\u014dshoku Ichidai Otoko), written in 1682, ends with the dissolute hero sailing off to find the legendary island of women, a bunch of sex toys stored on board. A little bit more practically, Yoshida Hanbei\u2019s 1686 *K\u014dshoku Kinm\u014d Zu* has some claim to be Japan\u2019s first encyclopedia of sex education, detailing everything from anatomy to sex positions to how to behave on a visit to the Yoshiwara.Alfred Haft writes of Yoshida\u2019s book: > After an essay on male-male intercourse, and another discussing the shapes of male and female sexual organs, Hanbei provided illustrations of \"Paraphernalia\" (kizai), which range from ordinary things found in a woman's bedroom or dressing room (mirror stand, make-up jars, clothing, etc.), to sex toys (such as strap-on dildos), to a grocery section, which illustrates some of the foodstuffs recommended to restore energy after lovemaking: burdock root, yams, eggs, loach, and eels.- Haft, Alfred. \u201cAffirming the Life Erotic: Yoshida Hanbei's K\u014dshoku Kinm\u014d Zui (1686).\u201d Japan Review, no. 26, 2013, pp. 99\u2013116. JSTOR, _URL_0_.(The entire essay is well worth reading for a view into the era\u2019s attitude towards sex.)These references are about eighty years after the novel *Shogun* is set, but if by the 1680s, the use of sex toys is so ubiquitous and celebrated, it would be no surprise if such sex toys were in some contexts in use in 1600. Smith particularly doubts if a daimyo\u2019s lady such as Mariko would be accustomed to sex toys, in the way that Clavell presents. Perhaps not, but I want to share a bit of very popular literature from 1748 that may not pertain to a lady in 1600, but might explain why Clavell could make the association.In an essay on *shunga* (erotic prints) audiences in Japan, Hayakawa Monta writes: >  The common contemporary \u201cpolite\u201d view of pornography in Japan is that it is obscene and tends to be aimed at lecherous men, but there are a considerable number of sources from the Edo period that suggest that women too were fans of *shunga*. One early example from 1748 is from the j\u014druri \u6d44\u7460\u7483 (and later kabuki) play *Kanadehon ch\u016bshingura* \u4eee\u540d\u624b\u672c\u5fe0\u81e3\u8535 (Treasury of Loyal Retainers), based on the actual 1703 samurai vendetta of the forty seven *r\u014dnin*. There are some interesting lines spoken by the merchant Amakawaya Gihei, who is helping the *r\u014dnin* obtain weapons. He has hidden the weapons in some large chests and is preparing to load these onto boats for transporting from Osaka to Edo. At this point enemy soldiers arrive and demand to inspect the chests.  >  > When the soldiers try to open the chest, Gihei runs up and kicks them, and plops down on top of the chest with his legs crossed. He declaims: \u201cThis long box contains personal articles ordered by the wife of a certain daimyo, including *shunga* books and sex toys. Her name is written on each article, even on the order for the erotic materials. If you open the box you will be exposing to public view the name of a great family. And seeing this name may endanger your lives.\u201d > After hearing Gihei\u2019s words, the soldiers withdraw, but the point to note here is that the soldiers believed Gihei, that a daimyo\u2019s wife could be a customer for erotic books and sex toys. is implies that the audience of the time would also accept this assumption as being true. We can conclude that whether it was true or not, it was commonly expected that highborn ladies would be interested in and enjoy *shunga*, even if they wished to keep this from public view. - p. 20, Hayakawa, Monta \u201cWho Were the Audiences for \u2018Shunga?\".\u201d Japan Review, no. 26, 2013.

For example, we had the understanding of how to build mechanical calculators (/computers) from a theoretical standpoint from the 17th century - but manufacturing tolerances were not fine enough to allow for their construction.

Trade was breaking down and becoming more regional than international.  Leadership was becoming more regional, so leaders could pull on the resources of smaller and smaller places.  Now, think of what we find concrete \"useful\" for, even today.  It's for building things that are big, and able to repeated.  ~~We don't use concrete to build a house, usually, because it's a lot easier to just make it out of wood and plaster.~~ **Edit: this is far from universal and causing some disruption - the main point is that you certainly wouldn't use concrete to build a house in Roman or Medieval times, even if it were possible, as concrete was expensive and time consuming.** In Roman times, concrete was used for things like monumental architecture, large scale building of ports, etc.  As the Roman Empire fell, these things became in less demand.  It was more difficult for leaders in the areas that flaked off of the empire to demand large-scale participating in building projects, and to amass the funds necessary for monumental architecture on the Roman scale.  Populations started relying far less on foreign trade, and became more focused on subsistence within their region.Edit: /u/michaemoser has comment [below](_URL_0_) on the importance of the decline of trade to Roman Concrete. > For concrete you first of all need cement, modern cement is Portland cement - that is produced by heating calcite and other ingredients to temperatures of 1300C. The Romans could not produce such temperatures, so they were using naturally occurring cement of volcanic origin - Pozzolana (it stinks, actually ).So you would not have that locally - you have to bring that from far away (the Romans would bring it from the town of Pozzuoli - near modern Naples).  /u/michaemoserWhile this doesn't describe why it was also lost on the Italian peninsula, it does speak to the importance of trade in maintaining some \"advanced\" technologies.So a large part of why concrete was no longer used is simply that it was no longer useful.  Passing information down from generations is an incredibly arduous task - you either have to spend many hours writing it down on extremely expensive parchment, or many hours teaching it, person to person, for generations.  When a technology is no longer in demand, the effort to pass it down is unequal to the reward one would get for doing so.We are more familiar with this process in our modern era when new processes are superseded by old ones.  Will you be able to find a VCR repairman in 50 years?  Probably not.  But we need to remember that technology becomes non-useful for many different reasons, not just because of replacement with better technology.Edit:Also, there is a misconception about technology during the medieval period that it was entirely a process of decline, forgetting, etc., that was more prominent when we thought of that era as the \"dark\" ages.  People always seem to be innovative, and the medieval period is no exception - the development of heavy plough, for instance, allowed agriculture in Northern Europe to be much more productive than it had ever been before.  The medieval period had plenty of technological development - heavy ploughs, pointed arches, early firearms and siege weaponry, to name a few - but they were all relevant to medieval life.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Romans were the first to use concrete in construction, but the process was lost with the fall of Rome.

However, one of the things about America that likely exacerbates the scars stems from how we approach the topic in schools.The rise of the modern education system isn't a straight line starting in 1776. Rather, it evolved through a combination of factors that included explicit policy, funding sources, curriculum emphasis, and different philosophies. That said, one constant factor in American education has been the needs of white boys (and sometimes girls) and men (and eventually women) at the center. And part of that means approaching America's history in a way that feels as comfortable as possible to those in the dominiate group; that is, white women teaching white children. The easiest way to consider how that's made manifest is to compare how chattel slavery is taught in America to how unified Germany has taught World War II. German grammar schools typically use the same history resources and history textbooks, and their books explicitly address the role of the ordinary German citizens in the war. (I'd be remiss if I didn't mention there were differences in how East and West Germany approached the history but they're not germaine.) It wasn't softened for young children but wasn't graphic - just straightforward. It was and is \"more than just dealing with the victims of the Holocaust: it includes an examination of the ideological basis of National Socialism, social conditions that were the foundation of the Third Reich and the planning and course of the Second World War.\"^1 Teachers received training in how to talk about an individual's role in the war, how to design field trips to camps, and the rationale behind the curriculum. As a result, there's been a national conversation about the war for several generations, which means there's a general willingness to address the scars. Parents learned of it in school and accept the responsibility to talk to their children about the war. This isn't to say their approach has been right or without unintended consequences, but rather to demonstrate that the country approached their history with a collective mindset of understanding what happened.In stark contrast, there are American schools, attended by Black children, [named after Civil War generals](_URL_0_) who were slave-owners. More than a few of these schools were built in the 1940's and 50's, long after the end of the war. America doesn't have a federal education system - which means 50 states with 50 ideas on what should be taught when. Since American schools aren't required to share resources, textbook design has been informed by states that adopted state-wide curriculum, most notably Texas. And as Texas' Board of Education has historically been conservative (and mostly men and mostly white), the Civil War and slavery were treated like a minor event. At different points in the 1970's and 80's, enslaved people were referred to as \"workers\" or \"immigrants\" in the Texas standards. This language made their way into textbooks used as recently as 2015. Even states that haven't required textbook adoption by schools, such as New York, haven't historically required instruction about the role of slavery in any meaningful way. As an example, the 1934 US History high school exit exam asked students to write about the economic causes of the Civil War. Acceptable answers allowed the student to receive full credit without mentioning slavery. For much the late 19th and early 20th century, elementary teachers received little training in American history and their coursework typically focused on the colonial period. As a result, if a teacher was raised believing in the \"lost cause\" myth and that states-rights was the main cause of the Civil War, that's likely what she would pass onto her students. Meanwhile, teachers would tell stories about happy slaves and kind slave-owners that they were either taught in their preparation program or heard from their own families. Efforts by Black parents and educators to re-center the curriculum on the real harm to Black families has typically not been received well, even in diverse cities like New York City. Finally, teaching was seen as a gentle profession for women. Talk of the cruelty that slavery entailed wasn't something that society was willing to ask young, mostly white, women to do. This isn't to say that the history of slavery in America isn't taught, rather that, in the absence of a national commitment to helping citizens understand the realities of what it means to build a country's wealth through chattel slavery, most white Americans don't see the scars or understand where they came from. And since most positions of power have been held by white Americans, calls to address the scars through reparations or culturally-competent or Afrocentric curriculum have been historically ignored.____1.

The Ottoman Empire was a world power during its heyday and when the empire collapsed, it collapsed *hard.* In the chaos that followed, and the ill-advised attempts to partition the old Ottoman heartlands, the Turks found themselves fighting half their neighbors: Greeks in the west, French in the south, Armenians in the east, and various skirmishes with the Brits. Constantinople, the Ottoman capital since Mehmed II captured in 1453, was occupied. It was pretty much chaos. And Turkey was somewhat fortunate that the Russians were too busy fighting their own civil war to meddle in it. Turkey eventually won, obviously. But the important thing isn't the battles or the casualty figures: it's the fact that Turkey was fighting the Entente. The men who came to the forefront of Turkish politics in this period -- Ataturk, Karabekir, Cebesoy, Inonu -- were fighters. Many of them fought in the Balkan Wars, most of them fought in WWI (Yazici, who would go on to command in Korea, fought at Gallipoli), and many of the men who would go on to hold high posts in Turkey (President, Prime Minister, Speaker) served some military role. And then, while Turkey is still trying to find its place in the world (especially after the chaos that was WWII), it holds open elections and for the first time ever the government is dominated by men who didn't fight in one war or another. Bayar was elected in 1950 and the closest thing he had to military experience was as a young political radical (he would remain in office until the 1960 coup). His Prime Minister (who shared his long tenure), Menderes, similarly had no military experience. Koraltan, Speaker of the National Assembly over the same period, was in the same boat. As you can probably imagine, shifting from a government that was led primarily by former military officers or the politicians who worked with them to a government comprised almost exclusively of men who had never seen combat represented quite a shift in Turkish politics. While all of this was happening on the domestic front, Turkish foreign policy was changing, too. Early in the republics history, it had committed to a policy of neutrality: it wanted no part of any alliances. Turkey and (most of) the great powers sat down and figured out what to do with the Bosporus and Dardanelles, leading to the [Montreux Convention](_URL_1_), which imposed all sorts of military restrictions on transiting those waters. Everything seemed all hunky-dory and then WWII happened. When the dust settled and the Soviets were triumphant, they suddenly had an enormous military advantage over Turkey. In 1945, the treaty of friendship between the two countries expired and was not renewed. In 1946, the Soviets sent two letters suggesting Turkey agree to \"alter\" the Montreux Convention by making the Soviets a guarantor of the treaty (which, in diplomacy-speak, means a permanent Soviet military presence in the area) and, while they were at it, the Soviets [they wanted land, too](_URL_0_). You can read a bit more about it [here](_URL_4_), which the relevant parts being around page 44 on (in the pdf reader; the pdf pages say it's page 27). In the face of Soviet demands, the Turks really three options: capitulate and effectively become a satellite state, stand alone and [risk invasion](_URL_2_), or go to America. So the Turks went to America. As it happened, America was in the process of forming NATO, which would come into existence in 1949. To America, Turkey wanting in was a wonderful boon. Control over the straits, even if through an ally, was effectively a lever against the Soviets. As an aside, it's probably worth noting that Turkey also hosted nuclear-tipped missiles from 1959 until 1963. If those dates seem odd to anyone, they may be interested in knowing that the Cuban Missile Crisis was in 1962. If that seems an odd coincidence, it's because it wasn't. The Soviets pulled their missiles out of Cuba [because America agreed to pull their missiles out of Turkey](_URL_3_), not because they were intimidated. It makes you wonder if the Soviets sent missiles to Cuba solely to get them out of Turkey. But I digress.So when the Korean War broke out, Turkey had an opportunity: by sending troops there, it could achieve two objectives: it gave Turkey the opportunity to prove its commitment to America (and thus effectively guaranteeing NATO membership) and simultaneously align itself very publicly against the Soviets. It effectively sent a message that Turkey wasn't going to be bullied into accepting an unfair treaty by the Soviets and that, if the Soviets forced the issue, that Turkey would have friends that would help them. It would take until 1952 to finalize, but Turkey was effectively under NATO's aegis from 1950 on. 15,000 men sent to Korea was a small price to pay for that security.

The Soviets wanted to make the German populace suffer the way their families had to suffer under German occupation.With this in mind it should be easy to understand why so many Russians are unrepentant about the abuses and mass rapes. Its led to much revision by soviet and contemporary Russian historians. For example a Russian author and historian O.A. Rzheshevsky criticized Antonty Beevor (who wrote much about the mass rapes committed by Soviet soldiers) by saying that Beevor was lying and believing Neo-Nazi myths made up about the Soviets. That being said there are some Soviets soldiers who have said they are upset with what they did and that they got caught up in the heat of battle. A former Soviet army officer was quoted as saying  >  We were young, strong, and four years without women. So we tried to catch German women and ... Ten men raped one girl. There were not enough women; the entire population run from the Soviet Army. So we had to take young, twelve or thirteen year-old. If she cried, we put something into her mouth.

In a February 1945 conversation with Goebbels, Hitler exclaimed that in the event of an Allied usage of chemical weapons, he would order the mass execution of large numbers of captured British and American prisoners of war. [1] Records of Hitler's conversations with his inner circle demonstrate that by early 1945, Hitler possessed little compassion for either enemy combatants or even for German soldiers. In response to the bombing of Dresden in mid-February, Hitler had to be talked out of shooting Allied POWs en masse in retaliation. One of the aspects of this proposed war crime that appealed to him most was that the Allies might execute German POWs in revenge, motivating German soldiers to fight harder. \"The reason that they [German soldiers] give in so easily in the west is simply the fault of that stupid Geneva convention which promises them good treatment as prisoners. We must scrap this idiotic convention.\" (Ch 27) Such callous exclamations by Hitler in the final year of war challenge our confidence that Hitler still possessed much of any attachment he had ever had to conventional \"moral reasoning.\"Certainly, the practical impacts of Allied retaliation using chemical warfare were easy for German leadership to imagine. Stanley Lovell, former head of the wartime Office of Strategic Services's office of Research and Development, relates in his book *Of Spies and Stratagems* a transcript of a conversation with Luftwaffe chief Hermann Goering during a postwar interrogation, in which Goering relates that usage of chemical weapons in defense of the Reich was avoided out of fear of retaliation. As the German army relied substantially on horse-drawn transportation, chemical reprisal by the Allied armies would significantly impede logistics, as horses could not be efficiently protected from poison gas [2].Lovell's book is not to be taken at face value, but at any rate this purported dialogue does highlight that the German army would also suffer from the effects of chemical warfare.Allied forces had certainly made clear that they were prepared to respond to the initiation of chemical warfare. In June of 1943, President Roosevelt made it clear to the Axis powers that the Allies would retaliate in kind to any usage of poisonous gas: \"Any use of gas by any Axis power... will immediately be followed by the fullest possible retaliation upon munition centers, seaports, and other military objectives.\" [3] Nor was this an idle threat--throughout the war the western Allies were materially prepared for the possibility of chemical escalation. A rather notable incident highlighting this fact involved the air raid on Bari, Italy in December 1943, in which the transport ship *John Harvey* carrying mustard-gas bombs was destroyed by German planes, inadvertently releasing its poisonous cargo.Finally, as the Allied advance continued into Germany proper, the tactical use of chemical weapons became increasingly impractical. Fighting on German soil, chemical warfare would naturally endanger German noncombatants. At the same time, Soviet troops also eventually overran the sarin and tabun gas production facilities themselves.In summary, it was quite clear to the Germans that they stood to lose far more from opening Pandora's Box than they would gain, and the specter of retaliatory chemical warfare, which Hitler himself feared, was a sufficient deterrent to play a large role in discouraging the initiation of chemical warfare by Nazi Germany.[1] Ian Kershaw *Hitler: A Biography*[2] Stanley Lovell *Of Spies and Strategems: Incredible Secrets of World War II Revealed By a Master Spy*[3] Albert J.

In an environment of fiercely hostile states competing for supremacy, it doesn't really make sense for a successful general to write down his knowledge for all to read. And any ruler who got hold of such a document would find it in his best interests to surpress it. So how did a text on military methods end up as one of the most famous and widely read texts from Ancient China?In many ways, the \u5b6b\u5b50\u5175\u6cd5 (*Sun Zi Bing Fa*, \"Master Sun's Art of War\") is not the most promising place to look for an answer. The origins of the work are shrouded in mystery; the author may or may not be historical; the manuscript tradition is fraught with difficulties; the text itself was summed up by Robin Yates as \"terse and obscure\" and by Victor Mair as \"extraordinarily terse and maddeningly obscure\". We'll have to dig into these issues a bit if we are to get any sense of what the *Sun Zi* was meant to achieve.First, the origins. At first glance, this question seems easy to answer: in his \u53f2\u8a18 (*Shi Ji*, \"Records of the Grand Historian\"), the Han Dynasty scholar Sima Qian tells us that the *Sun Zi* was written around the early 5th century BC by a famous general called Sun Wu. Sima Qian offers some delightful biographical details of this Sun Wu, including the famous story of how he trained the concubines of the king of Wu in heavy infantry drill. The notion that there was indeed a historical Master Sun, who wrote his treatise on warfare at the end of the Spring and Autumn Period, is still held by many. If we adopt this view, the answer to your question is relatively simple: a fugitive from the northern state of Qi (according to one version of the story), Sun Wu needed to impress his new master the king of Wu, and apart from his display as a drillmaster, the compilation of his Thirteen Chapters (the *Sun Zi*) would have provided evidence of his abilities. The biographical tradition helpfully notes that his advice and leadership allowed Wu to expand and conquer its neighbour, Chu. The problem with this account of the genesis of the *Sun Zi* is that there is no earlier account of the life of a general named Sun Wu, and that the very practice of assigning authors to works is not something the Chinese actually did until after the end of the Spring and Autumn period. The find of a collection of texts on strips of bamboo - the traditional recording method - in a group of graves dating to the late 2nd century BC has confirmed that the *Sun Zi* existed more or less in its currently known form at that time, but there is no evidence that would support a date as early as the 400s BC. Moreover, if it did date that far back, it would be *by far* the earliest Chinese military treatise, with a gap of well over a century between it and its oldest successor. Indeed, the text itself has been shown to reflect the military practice of the Warring States period (c. 475-221 BC), not the Spring and Autumn period (c. 771-476 BC) in which it was supposedly written. The well-organised, well-drilled infantry armies envisioned by Master Sun do not belong to the era of chariot-borne warlords and their loose entourages that was the Spring and Autumn period. Its references to crossbows must place it in the period after these weapons were invented (sometime in the 4th century BC). In other words, the text is far more likely to be a product of the 4th century BC than the early 5th; as far as we can tell, the spread and recognition of the work as a military classic belongs to the early Han Dynasty.It is not surprising, then, that Chinese scholars as early as the 13th century AD have wondered whether the legendary author of the *Sun Zi* ever really existed. Many modern experts have been persuaded by Jens \u00d8stergard Petersen's argument that the details of Sima Qian's biography of Sun Wu are generic, and that all its elements can be found in biographies of other generals too. Sun Wu's name (effectively meaning something like \"wandering warrior\") is considered too convenient, and his historical context too vague, to take him seriously as a character of the late Spring and Autumn period. In fact, there is robust evidence of the existence of a general and military expert with the surname Sun - but his first name was Bin, and he lived well over a century after the alleged time in which Sun Wu flourished, and he is credited with writing an entirely separate treatise on military matters, which was rediscovered in the same collection that gave us the earliest extant traces of the *Sun Zi*. It seems all too likely that the family name Sun, famously associated with military expertise, became attached to a growing collection of martial wisdom compiled over the course of the Warring States period. The opening of each chapter of the text with the formula \"Master Sun said:\" is paradoxically an indication that there was never a \"Master Sun\" - only a succession of authors legitimising their wisdom through his reputation. Predictably, Sun Bin was eventually credited with being a descendant of the legendary Sun Wu, whose wisdom clearly ran in the family.The fact is that the way of recording Ancient Chinese texts, using the strips of bamboo mentioned above, is extremely conducive to this sort of textual tradition. Single strips of bamboo contain no more than one or a few lines of text; the strips are held together with string. As the string breaks or decays, texts become jumbled, with later editors often totally unable to restore them to their original order. From our point of view, it is shockingly easy for lines to be added or lost. One of the frustrating things about the *Sun Zi* is that much of its metatext - its \"next\"s and \"therefore\"s - don't actually make any sense, and that not enough serious philological study has been devoted to restoring the text. Given its many uncertainties, we are on far safer ground to assume that the work is the product of many hands over a long period (roughly the 4th and early 3rd centuries BC) than that it is the work of a single, legendary military genius.So where does that leave us with regard to your question? Why was the *Sun Zi* written? Who benefitted from writing it and spreading it around?Here we find a useful parallel in the tradition of Ancient Greek literature. In Greece, as in China, military treatises did not develop in a vaccuum, when a particular military mastermind decided to commit his wisdom to the ages. Rather, they began to appear in an era that saw a general shift in notions of learning, in which oral tradition and abstract thought began to gave way to practical written works that allowed knowledge in discreet fields of expertise to be replicated and taught. In Greece, as in China, the art of war was swept up in this movement by the conditions of the age: in Greece, the hegemonic wars of the Classical period (of which the Peloponnesian War seems to have been especially important as a driving force), and in China, the prolonged and devastating Warring States period. In both cultures, the earliest written works of philosophy had appeared some time before, and kickstarted a tradition of recording advanced thought for the benefit of others. It is not surprising to find Chinese catalogues grouping the *Sun Zi* in the Daoist (that is, philosophical) tradition. It and the many other military treatises that appeared soon after all fit into the same new approach to the spread of knowledge. The purpose of the text was to teach, so that future generations facing military problems would not have to reinvent the wheel.---**Sources*** R.D.S.

Prior to the military reversals of 1942, German propaganda had operated on the principle of presenting an \"ersatz reality,\" wherein the state-dominated media maximized Germany's victories and ignored the salient truth that Germany's war was not a short one and her enemies persisted in fighting Germany. The scale of defeats like Stalingrad, the growing Allied bomber raids, and the surrender of German forces in North Africa pricked this media bubble and German propaganda organs responded accordingly. This retooling of the Third Reich's propaganda apparatus in light of defeat pursued several seemingly counter-intuitive strategies. For one thing, despite the fact that the Third Reich was a personalist dictatorship *par excellence*, the figure of Hitler disappeared from German propaganda. In contrast to propaganda from the earlier years of victory, post-Stalingrad news of German military operations seldom invoked Hitler's name or connected him too heavily to military operations. This was part of a deliberate strategy on Goebbels's part as he recognized connecting Hitler too intimately to Germany's military fortunes made him, and by extension, the legitimacy of the entire regime, culpable when these operations did not bear fruit. Rather than present images of the F\u00fchrer, Hitler was  invoked in late war propaganda as an abstract figure that stood for all Germans. This could just be from invoking his title, or oblique historical analogies such as films that made apparent the connection between Hitler and historical personages like Frederick the Great. Hitler, whose visage was omnipresent in state propaganda between 1933-1941, became an abstraction. By the same token, German propaganda also emphasized the severity and violence of German military setbacks, but with a unique spin. Allied bombing, the Soviet massacres of Polish officers at Katyn, and other actions of the Allies became staples of German propaganda after the tide had turned as it showed that Germany's enemies were merciless. The idea behind this emphasis upon the Allies' purported barbarity was to bind the Germans together through a policy of \"strength through terror.\" This dehumanization of the Allies' military underscored that no compromise was possible and this was a war in which there was to be no quarter given and none expected.  These new strategies often dovetailed with established propaganda discourses that had been present within the Third Reich since 1933. The regime's castigation of the so-called \"November Criminals\" of 1918 also found new currency in this environment. Interrogations of German troops captured after 20 July 1944 often reported back that one key motivation for fighting on was to prevent a repeat of Germany's humiliating defeat at the end of the First World War.  One important component of the demonization of the Allied military was that German retribution was in the making. Since 1933, one of the central legitimizing planks of the NSDAP was that it had enabled German technology and genius to reach its full potential. The vaunted V-weapons tapped into this established narrative that German technical expertise brooked no rivals. But beyond rockets and other *Wunderwaffen*, National Socialism had always stressed the ability of the will to transcend any material obstacles. This propaganda's emphasis upon collective action in the face of numerical superiority fed into this notion that the will is superior to rational logic. Similarly, the destruction of German landmarks and the seemingly indiscriminate nature of Allied bombing heightened the sense that this was a cultural war and that the Germanic culture constantly trumpeted by the Third Reich was in existential danger. One sinister aspect of the late war propaganda was its turn to a heightened antisemitism. Goebbels used the solidarity of Allied coalition of both the imperial Britain, hypercapitalist United States, and the Bolshevik USSR as evidence of grand global Jewish conspiracy against Germany. Victor Klemperer, a German Jew who by fortune escaped deportation and murder, would note in his diaries the increasingly shrill antisemitism in propaganda as Germany's fortunes waned. The widespread knowledge about the Holocaust amongst the German public imparted a weight to this propaganda that it might not have otherwise possessed. Although they might not have known the specifics of the Holocaust, most Germans were aware that something quite terrible had happened to the Jews in the East. Even though the antisemitism was troweled on so thick to strain credibility in this propaganda, it encouraged the expectation that the Allies would hold Germany collectively responsible  for the mass murder of the Jews. This does not mean that the German public accepted the NSDAP and Propaganda Ministry's antisemitism wholesale, but in some cases interpreted antisemitism quite differently than the state. One popular rumor among German civilians in 1943/4 was that Hungary had not been the target of any Allied  bombings was because the Hungarian government had spared its Jews. The SD recorded a number of complaints that because the Horthy government has ghettoized Jews in Budapest the Allies would not attack this human shield, and there was grumbling within the German populace that Hitler did not do the same for cities like Berlin or Hamburg. And some of this disgruntlement was not clandestine, but took the form of direct petitions to Goebbels. There were a string of letters to the Propaganda Ministry after the mass operations to clear Hungary's Jews in 1944 demanding that they be used as human hostages against Allied bombing. But the general acceptance of some of the antisemitism produced by Goebbels's machine precluded any thought or possibility of a negotiated peace for much of the German public. News of the Morgenthau Plan, which would have deindustrialized Germany, the expansion of Allied bombing, and the scale of German reverses fostered the expectation of a Carthaginian peace.   The effectiveness of this late-war propaganda is open to interpretation. While it could not rekindle hope in final victory, it did strengthen the resolve of some Germans to see the war to its bitter conclusion. Yet, even as propaganda turned to negative integration (uniting around a threat), it could not arrest the gradual estrangement of much of the German public to the National Socialist state. Goebbels himself appreciated this sentiment and his famous  February 1943 *Sportpalast* speech had veiled threats against the \"Golden Pheasants\" of the NSDAP who were thus far still enjoying a prewar lifestyle.  This late-war propaganda often worked in conjunction with greater arbitrary state violence directed against Germans, especially after the 20 July plot. Extralegal state violence had been embedded in the DNA of the Third Reich since 1933, but outside of political enemies and German Jews, most Germans' interaction with arbitrary state violence was the *threat* of it until around Stalingrad, when the security services began a much more thorough crackdown against shirkers and potential fifth-columnists. The 20 July plot helped to further this turn towards extralegal violence and other forms of domestic terror. Most Germans would have been obviously aware that the war had been going poorly by 1943. Analysis of letters sent back home as well as SD reports show a drop in expectations of victory. There were simply too many salient reverses to ignore. The Allied bomber campaign against the Ruhr and the sound of flak would have been something impossible to ignore. The government itself publicized some of the Allied victories as an example that Germany's back was against the wall. Goebbels and other media arms would try and manage news of defeats such as framing retreats as tactical withdrawals. Other mass surrenders like Stalingrad and Tunisia were framed as modern day sacrifice in the vein of Leonidas and the 300 Spartans. This spin-doctoring of defeat became so ubiquitous that one grim homefront joke was \"what sound does a clock make when it goes forwards? *Tick-~~tock~~tack*. When it goes backwards? *Tak-tik*.\" By the the winter of 1944, the Red Army had begun to occupy German territory in the East (both in the Reich and those annexed in 1939) and Goebbels's propaganda ministry published lurid atrocity tales. Moreover, the advance of Anglo-American arms across France had eliminated what had been Hitler's greatest strategic victory in 1940. The retreat of German troops as well as the fall of the German city of Aachen in October 1944 would have been a reality that would have been difficult to ignore. The mid- and late-war propaganda drive for mass action and a collective response to Allied aggression worked in often counterintuitive ways. While it stiffened resolve to not have a repeat of November 1918, propaganda along with the deteriorating war effort engendered a kind of grim fatalism for the future. Both rhetoric and reality heightened the sense of social anomie and the breakdown of society that came as bombing and wartime pressures destroyed the German infrastructure and stretched the civilian domestic economy well past its breaking point. The final agonies of the last few months of the war, as well as the violence meted out to Germans that shirked in their duties, helped to cement the postwar myth that Germans were double victims of the war- who were both subject to extreme violence from their military enemies, but also brutalized by a hypocritical criminal regime.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The German media covered the extensive German retreats in the last years of the Second World War in a variety of ways.

Their mythology and history expressly stated that they were the first civilization. They believed that the universe was created on a \"mound of creation\" (as it's called by Egyptologists), which rose out of the receding flood waters of the Nile. There are various versions of the creation story, but in the most exciting one [Atum or Re-Atum](_URL_4_) created the first pantheon of deities by masturbating them into existence: \"Atum is the one who came into being as one who came [(with penis) extended](_URL_0_) in Heliopolis. He put his penis in his fist so that he might make orgasm with it, and the two twins were born, Shu and Tefnut.\"^1 This mound of creation is called Benben by Egyptologists (Egyptian \ud80c\udcc0\ud80c\ude16\ud80c\udcc0\ud80c\ude16\ud80c\ude74), and it was a common feature of temples for millennia of Egyptian history, demonstrating the incredible longevity of this idea.^2Most cultures have a creation myth that puts them at the center, so that doesn't completely answer your question. In Egypt, however, they kept written records of their history, which referenced their understanding of creation. There are frequent allusions to the \"original time\" (\ud80c\udd6e\ud80c\udfcf\ud80c\udfd6) in Egyptian texts, including the Pyramid Texts, and a glimpse of what they understood this to mean is found in the [Turin Royal Canon](_URL_1_).^3 That document records the reigns of kings from the New Kingdom back to the reigns of well-known Egyptian deities, including Seth, Horus, and Thoth. The tomb of the First Dynasty king [Djer](_URL_2_) (also in the Turin Canon, II.13 in the facsimile) was later venerated as the tomb of the god Osiris. So not only did they believe that they were the first civilization, created ex nihilo by the gods, they had places where they could go and see those gods' tombs in person. Their official history recorded the descent of their living kings from ancient deities, and they continually referred to these deities in contemporary texts. When they found old things, they knew that those things belonged to their civilization, and that they were directly descended from the people who made them.Sources:1.

According to David Hodo (the construction worker in the Village People):  >  It was 1977, and we were leaving a photography session on 23rd Street. Jacques Morali saw the big pink YMCA on 23rd and asked, \u201cWhat is this YMCA, anyway? \u201cAnd after laughing at his accent, we told him the Y was a place where you could go when you first came to New York when you didn\u2019t have any money \u2014 you can stay there for very little. And of course, someone joked, \u201cYeah, but don\u2019t bend over in the showers. \u201cAnd Jacques, bless his heart, said, \u201cI will write a song about this!\u201dThe Jacques mentioned by Hodo is Jacques Morali, a French producer who was the (co-)writer and producer of all of the Village People's biggest hits; Morali was gay, and sadly passed away in 1991 from AIDS. In the group itself, there was a mix of sexualities in the Village People, with some members identifying as straight, some being ambiguous in print about it, and some identifying as gay. For instance, another member of the Village People - Victor Willis, the lead singer of 'YMCA' - is notable for being quite insistent that he is heterosexual; he married the actress who played Clair Huxtable on the *Cosby Show*. Willis has a co-write on the song, and Randy Jones (the cowboy in the Village People) says in the Spin oral history that:  > It was not intended as a gay anthem. Do you have the lyrics in front of you? There\u2019s nothing gay about them. I think Victor wrote the words, but it\u2019s all a big fucking mystery. The guy who really deserves the credit is Horace Ott, who arranged the horns and strings. Jacques had the ideas, but Horace transformed them into songs.In contrast, Hodo says in the same article that :  > \u201cY.M.C.A.\u201d certainly has a gay origin. That\u2019s what Jacques was thinking when he wrote it, because our first album [1977\u2019s Village People] was possibly the gayest album ever. I mean, look at us. We were a gay group. So was the song written to celebrate gay men at the YMCA? Yes. Absolutely. And gay people love it.According to a [2013 analysis of the song and the relationship between the YMCA and 1970s gay culture in *The Believer* by Nicole Pasulka](_URL_3_):  > At the Y, a spiritual man was a well-built, muscular man. The organization\u2019s leadership positioned the regional branches as destinations that could protect newcomers from \u201cnegative\u201d influences. It was here that many young guys had their first homosexual experiences. So Jacques Morali and Randy Jones were part of a history that included both diligent Christian bodybuilders and men cruising for \u201ctrade\u201d\u2014straight-identified, masculine men. Pasulka and the Spin oral history both portray the YMCA as a place with an official anti-homosexuality policy, but a culture where homosexuality was often common. Pasulka also portrays the YMCA culture as becoming less gay towards the end of the 1970s, and becoming closer to mainstream culture, comparing it to the Village People's acceptance by the mainstream. By all accounts, in a world where much of gay culture was very underground, the fairly obvious gay subtext of the Village People to modern viewers was less obvious at the time to the mainstream - there wasn't much public knowledge about what Pasulka calls 'clone culture'; gay stereotypes at the time were very feminised. In contrast to the feminised stereotype, the Village People cast a knowing look at heterosexual masculine stereotypes with their choice of dress - cowboys, construction workers, etc - and the knowing look was missed by a lot of the mainstream at the time. This meant that the Village People could deny the gay subtext was there when they felt it was appropriate - and for Victor Willis who may have written some or all of the lyrics, there really might have been no gay subtext.According to contemporary reports, the YMCA floated suing the Village People for defamation because of the implications of homosexuality, but didn't go through it - in the context of 'clone culture' etc, and Willis's denials of homosexuality it would have been quite awkward to prove. In contrast, the YMCA is now more relaxed about the gay overtones; their media relations manager said to Spin in 2008 that \"We at the YMCA celebrate the song. It\u2019s a positive statement about the YMCA and what we offer to people all around the world.\"As to why a room full of 13 year olds at a church gathering would enthusiastically dance to the song in later decades, the Spin oral history notes that, by the 1990s, the song began to be used in sports settings in America, encouraged by team managers and the like who thought the song would be a crowd pleaser. According to, for instance, the director of stadium operations at the Brevard County Manatees:  > There are a handful of songs that just make you get up and dance. At our ballpark, \u201cY.M.C.A.\u201d has to be considered one of them. \u201cY.M.C.A.\u201d is a gay song? Honestly, I had no clue.'YMCA' certainly isn't the only song with an origin in or links to gay subculture which has become a successful sports song; Queen's 'We Will Rock You/We Are The Champions' and Frankie Goes To Hollywood's 'Relax' both come to mind. Perhaps there is a story there about the cluelessness of most sporting people around the cultural clues surrounding music; things that are very obvious to people who are engaged in the culture of pop music often slide past the heads of people who are much less engaged in that culture. But of course, pop music by its very nature is there to be *used*, and the people who make pop music generally hope for it to appeal to as big an audience as possible. Whether Hodo's claims about Morali's inspiration for the song are accurate, Morali very clearly produced the song to be a commercial hit. And to be popular, pop music generally has to provide something useful to more than one group of people, as there are always different groups in society who are consuming pop music; songs without a mass appeal amongst different demographics tend to not have...mass appeal. 'YMCA' has - and has always had -  a multitude of uses beyond 'celebrating the closeted homosexual interactions occurring in ~~1960's~~ 1970s Christian gymnasiums'. It would never have gotten to #1 (in the UK, Canada, Australia, and much of Europe) or #2 (in the US) if that was its sole purpose - at least some of the places where it was successful would not have understood the meaning of 'YMCA', let alone the overtones of sexuality. After all, the song is very danceable, with a four-to-the-floor disco beat that works very effectively. It has easily replicable dance moves that are fun to do. It's clearly catchy. Victor Willis's vocal performance is strong in a soul shouter kind of way. The costumes of the group are memorable and their dancing is interesting to look at when you see the video. It also fit squarely within an extremely popular genre - disco - [which dominated the airwaves and the charts in the late 1970s, to the discontent of the rock audience shouting 'disco sucks'](_URL_0_). It's entirely unsurprising that it was a worldwide success in 1978.Peter Shapiro's book *Turn The Beat Around: The Secret History Of Disco* claims that the Village People were: > practically *personae non grata* in the gay clubs. Instead, the Village People got most of their play at aerobics classes for senior citizens who could perform the accompnaying dance to 'YMCA' without taxing their bodies too much, at barbecues by car mechanics who thought 'YMCA' was about playing basketball, at strait-laced high school proms in Kansas and at children's playgroups. It was Middle America that took the Village People close to its bosom\".The Village People, in some ways, have stayed in public consciousness as an avatar of the cheesiness of late 1970s disco - disco has a reputation for cheese, and the Village People were pretty cheesy even for disco. Peter Shapiro's *Turn The Beat Around: The Secret History Of Disco* is scathing about the group: \"if disco had a nadir it was unquestionably the Village People. The Village People represented everything naff about disco: the stale beats seemingly phoned in by studio hacks, the dunderheaded English-as-a-foreign-language lyrics, the complete lack of subtletly, all delivered by [a bunch of stereotypes]\". Shapiro, of course, is attempting to rehabilitate the critical opinion about disco in this book, to explain its import and meaning, and he is intent on showing that disco had a smarter, more cosmopolitan side than you see in the Village People. Nonetheless, he also admits that - even if they're a harmless novelty act - the Village People have a 'goofy pleasure'.

But first we have to go back to mainframes...Back in the days of yore, desktop computers weren't a thing. Instead, you'd have a keyboard and monitor connected to a terminal of one sort or another. There were two main categories: *character-oriented* terminals and *block (or data stream)-oriented* terminals. The former was cheaper to make due to the smaller component count and simply transmitted each keypress to the connected mainframe or (later on) minicomputer.*Block-oriented* terminals were an interesting development. In exchange for adding a bit more circuitry to each terminal, the demands on a mainframe's time could be decreased. For example, consider an airline ticketing system. A booking agent wants to search for flights from JFK to SFO, deparing on 7/5/74. A *character-oriented* terminal would interrupt the mainframe each time a character was pressed, leading to expensive context switches as the mainframe had to service requests from each active terminal. A *block-oriented* terminal would be able to present a form with fillable fields for origin, destination, and date, which would only interrupt the mainframe when all data was submitted at once. IBM was able to take advantage of this to allow a single mainframe to serve a massive amount of terminals, but this meant that any interaction represented a relatively significant expense as compared to *character-oriented* terminals. (Consider the case of typing a paragraph of text and saving it. On a *character-oriented* terminal, the \"save\" command would be just one interrupt, after the interrupts for each letter. On a *block-oriented* terminal, the \"save\" command would be the *only* interrupt.)This meant it was to IBM's benefit to be able to accomplish tasks with as few interactions as possible. Interactive time-sharing applications of the time such as ISPF could present menus, but navigating a hierarchical menu meant the mainframe would have to do more work. The solution was shortcut keys. Depending on context, a mainframe's numbered PF keys would accomplish different tasks. A user would memorize the ones they used most frequently, while common shortcuts could be displayed at the bottom of the screen, both resulting in fewer interrupts for the mainframe.How did we get from mainframes to PCs? When the original IBM PC launched, it had 10 function keys in a bank on one side of the keyboard. PCs didn't have time-sharing capabilities, and each keystroke generated an interrupt, but users still enjoyed the ability to streamline frequent tasks when supported by a given application. A subsequent model, the PC/AT, contained a standard keyboard layout with exactly half of the 24 function keys that were common on 3270-series terminals of the time, arranged in one bank rather than two.

Your odds of survival might not be too good if, say, we're talking about the Yamasee War. The situation was so desperate for the Carolinians they started arming their slaves, which would have made them targets too. Generally speaking though, most Native nations and enslaved Africans recognized that they had a common enemy and alliances between the two are historically frequent.  In what's now the continental United States, these alliances date back to 1526, when Ayllon's attempt to colonized mainland North America failed when (among other hardships) the colony's slaves joined the local Guale to oust the Spanish. Similar alliances would continue into the 1800s, with the integration of former slaves into the Seminole in Florida.The letters of William Johnson (the man in charge of relations between Great Britain and Native American communities, especially the Haudenosaunee [Iroquois] leading up to the American Revolution) mentions a Cayuga man who he refers to only as \"the Negro\" who had risen to become the leader of one of the Cayuga villages.  Most likely this man had been captured and adopted by the Cayuga. He'd have to have become a member of one of the clans in order to become the head of the village. Assuming he went through the normal adoption process and wasn't fast-tracked for some reason, the first couple years may have seemed little different from slavery. He'd be the lowest ranking person in the family, a given the worst work. But working hard, he'd have gained prestige and the family's trust.Of course, relations between Native Americans and enslaved Africans weren't always so promising. Johnson also talks about Mohawk bounty hunters who tracked escaped slaves in the northern colonies. In the South, the adoption of race-based slavery was one of the features of \"civilization\" that Euro-Americans encouraged among the \"Five Civilized Tribes.\" This included the Seminoles, who owned slaves even while allying with freed Africans.

During the nineteenth century, it was possible for individual travelers to purchase mummies and ship them back to Europe without any interference from customs authorities. So, the most common sort of mummy unwrapping party would be a standard Victorian dinner party held by a friend of yours who has recently return from his travels abroad. Instead of showing photos, he would regale you with tales of his journey. As the featured event of the evening, he would bring out the mummy he had purchased, place it on a central table (could even be the billiard table in his games room) and remove the bandages any way he could. During the process, he would attempt to spook you with stories of ancient curses or impress you with his knowledge. At the end, the mummified dead body would be on display. The overall effect could be either one of a learned lecture or of telling spooky stories around a campfire.The second type was a form of public spectacle. You would be invited to an exhibition featuring artifacts returned from Egypt (i.e. looted) and, after having traveled through the exhibit and dined, a sarcophagus would be brought out and opened with great ceremony. The mummy would be slowly unwrapped by someone with considerable expertise. The jewelry and protective amulets found within the wrappings would be shown to all and passed around. Some exhibitors even had a rotating stand which they could place the mummy on, so they could unwrap the mummy with great flourishes and show all sides as the body was slowly unveiled. After the body was unwrapped, you would be invited to come closer and gaze into the face of an ancient prince/priest/whatever. Giovanni Belzoni, a former circus strongman who was a prolific looter/Egyptologist, is perhaps the most famous of the showman-type unwrapping party throwers. (See \"Popular Exhibitions, Science and Showmanship, 1840-1910\" by Jill A. Sullivan, pp. 206ff)The third type was the most exclusive and was part of a meeting of a learned society such as the Royal Asiatic Society or the Mechanics Institution and involve the \"great and the good\" of society (aristocrats, bishops, doctors, et c.). Such an unwrapping would be considered essentially an act of scientific study by scholars and accompanied by a lecture. You would be gathered around the mummy, which could be in its original sarcophagus or only in its bandages. The speed of the unwrapping could vary quite a bit, depending on whether those gathered were interested in the nature of the wrapping itself or in the body and the mummification processes involved. Those with the talent would be called upon to sketch the unwrapping as it proceeded with the idea of presenting the sketches as a record of the procedure or as the plates that would form part of a scholarly publication. The person doing the unwrapping would be a doctor or surgeon. Once the body was unwrapped, it would be examined minutely by the participants to determine what could be learned anatomically and about the mummification process (although some participants would likely be more voyeuristic than scientific). The body and its wrappings was usually donated to a museum after the party. Thomas Pettigrew became quite famous during Victorian times for this type of mummy unwrapping party, and wrote about such parties in the introduction to his book \"A History of Egyptian Mummies, and an Account of the Worship and Embalming of the Sacred Animals by the Egyptians; With Remarks on the Funeral Ceremonies of Different Nations, and Observations on the Mummies of the Canary Islands, of the Ancient Peruvians, Burman Priests  & c\" published in 1834.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The mummy will be wrapped in a cloth and then a sledgehammer will be used to crack the wrappings.

In fact, the privileges originally applied to current students as well.The modern university system in the West is born in the 12th-13th century, out of the so-called \"cathedral schools.\" Not at all coincidentally, this is the era of a massive revival of interest in written law, both civil and canon (secular and Church); and the bureaucratization of governments (which includes the Church). The basic goal of these early universities is to train preachers for the laity and clerks to staff bureaucracies.Per medieval law, a \"privilegium\" is a private law, which means a law that applies only to one person or group as opposed to all of society. In 1158, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa stuffed a *privilegium* entitled Authentica Habita into an otherwise-unrelated council decree. Habita granted safe conduct to scholars traveling throughout the HRE for the purposes of study (which includes part of Italy during this time). It also granted scholars the right to be tried for alleged crimes by a judge of their own choice, rather than automatically subject to the civil jurisdiction of the town that accused them.This was important for the scholars because the 12th century was rather much an era of petty violence, and *traveling* scholars might well find themselves kidnapped and held hostage by one lord or town to extract payment or leverage from another lord. It was important for Frederick because among his closest counselors were legal scholars from the Bologna schools--who had written effusively in support of his imperial claims.Just as Frederick's legal scholars built on Roman law traditions when they shaped the scholarly *privilegium* of the Habita, other principalities in Europe would build on that decree to extend their own protections to scholars. This movement from secular law coincided neatly with an unshakeable principle of medieval higher education. Thanks to the roots of the university system in cathedral schools and ongoing ties between the universities and the Church, students (and by extension, teachers) were necessarily minor clerics. The privilegia offered to clergy were theirs, especially the right to be tried in an ecclesiastical rather than civic court for any crimes.Well, concentrate a group of adolescents into one place and you're going to end up with shenanigans, right? From 1200 on, there is an escalating trail of sources detailing \"town-gown\" friction in the Middle Ages. Tavern brawls, riots, murders, landlords that make the Thenardiers look like the Holiday Inn. Increasingly, legal scholars interpreted and reinterpreted *Habita* and its sister privilegia to cover more and more legal territory. Statutes proliferated. Civic authorities who arrested students in 1210 Paris, for example, had to make sure they were kept in a *nice* jail. In 1265 England, Oxford students were exempt from jury duty. 13th-14th century legal scholars tried very hard to blanket Europe with statutes asserting that scholars did not have to pay taxes. By 1500, burning down the residence of a scholar was considered not just arson but *sacrilege*, because of the holy books he was assumed to possess.Why would Philip IV, desperate for funds to support his campaign in Flanders, free France's intellectual community from paying the war tax? Well, again, the people advising Philip down this path were scholars and university graduates themselves.Additionally, though, privileges to universities and their corporate body (students and teachers) actually played a role in intranational politics. It was a chance for king/emperor and arch/diocesan Church (arch/bishop-level) to assert their authority over local government (town and parish). Of course the high-minded explanation offered was the need for scholars to devote themselves to study. And while we can appreciate the more romantic tinges of this notion, there is a practical core: the faster students get through university, the more clerks are available to staff princely courts, the more preachers can get out in the field to fight heretics and save souls--increasing, respectively, civic and ecclesiastical authority and power.The [university degree, or rather degrees](_URL_0_), themselves awarded additional privileges. Most importantly for the universities themselves, the ability to teach at various levels. However, it was a fairly regular occurrence in the Middle Ages to complete most of an education without paying the hefty additional fee to receive the degree. It was a question of whether the student needed the credential (for example, to continue education in one of the higher faculties of law, medicine, or theology) versus what he ([always he](_URL_1_) in the Middle Ages) could afford.From around 1500 or so, however, civic governments exercised increasing control of universities as the Church's iron control fluctuated. Local nobles sat in judgment of internal university disputes, as in Ingolstadt (in Bavaria). Growing attention to public order meant the excesses of students that earlier privilegia had protected needed to be brought under control. The rights, responsibilities, privileges, and immunities of the Middle Ages were gradually etched away.As I write this from a university server: it's nice to dream, isn't it?", "label": 0}, {"content": "The term 'degree' is a legal term, and the degree confers certain rights and privileges.

(**Edit:** And, as others have pointed out, not much else.)**On the subject of Leonardo's research being lost until too late, for those unfamiliar:**Upon Leonardo's death in 1519, his student Melzi took possession of his notes but the dense content proved impossible to prepare for publication. No small part of the blame here may be laid at the doorstep of the master himself, for Leonardo\u2019s style was difficult at best.He is well-known for his \u201cmirrored\u201d handwriting, with the notes moving from right to left across the page, but that was only the first layer of the problem. He used no punctuation, invented his own shorthand as well as compounding and dividing words at apparent random, and even formed letters of the alphabet in his own personal way. Oftentimes he eschewed the written word completely in favor of multi-page sequences of hand-drawn images, which like his writing ran backwards from right to left.And of course the knowledge contained within this labyrinthine set of documentation was revolutionary for the time: in scientific terms only a few others on the planet would have been able to follow along Leonardo\u2019s path of analysis with true understanding and comprehension, and even thirty years after Leonardo\u2019s death the scholar Vasari referred to him as heretical.It would have taken a unique person to decipher Leonardo\u2019s notes, make sense of the findings within, organize and compile them into something suitable for publication, and then have the bravery to publish in an inimical political and religious climate\u2014and perhaps in the end there was no one better suited to accomplish this than Leonardo himself. Our best hope at the time was the aforementioned student, Francesco Melzi, who made a valiant attempt but found himself adrift in the eighteen volumes of notes Leonardo left him. Even with two assistants to help process the deluge and forty years of effort, he was overwhelmed, and upon his death in 1568 the studies ended up passing from person to person throughout the centuries, never fully appreciated or understood, until finally being published in 1900 after the surviving folios made their way to London and the Royal Collection.Their significance was immediately recognized, but \u201cby then, their power to affect the progress of anatomical knowledge had long passed.\u201d **On the subject of whether or not any of it is still useful:**One of Leonardo's modern-day proponents is a British heart surgeon, Francis Wells. Doctor Wells specializes in mitral valve repair operations. Typically, this type of repair is accomplished by narrowing the valve\u2019s diameter to restrict backflow, but after studying Leonardo\u2019s anatomical analyses of the heart, the surgeon discovered there was a better way, thanks to Leonardo\u2019s identification of the opening phase of the valve\u2019s movement as crucial to the overall cycle. With this new knowledge, Doctor Wells has modified his mitral valve repair procedures and successfully treated 80 patients (**Edit:** /u/ItsAConspiracy found a [more recent source](_URL_1_) upping this number to 2,000+), restoring them to a quality of life previously not possible. He suggests, \u201cLeonardo had a depth of appreciation of the anatomy and physiology of the body\u2014its structure and function\u2014that perhaps has been overlooked by some,\u201d and is studying the rest of Leonardo\u2019s anatomical work in hopes of finding other refinements to modern procedures.Even more compelling is Leonardo\u2019s influence on the cutting edge of modern medicine\u2014the development of precision robots to assist in surgical procedures. Leonardo himself, despite his prescience in so many other technological areas, may have been surprised to learn that since 1983, some surgeries have been accomplished with robotic tools.  There is some reason to think Leonardo may have anticipated this eventuality, however; in 1495, Leonardo designed and built one of the first humanoid robots, a mechanical knight capable of sitting up, turning his head, and waving his arms, all in time to the sounds of artificial drums. When modern-day robotics expert Mark Rosenheim set out to duplicate this robot, it took him five years of work, and in his research he discovered: > Leonardo\u2019s anatomical drawings were unique and gave him the information needed to emulate the complex joints and muscles of the human body. The wrist joint, which is one of the body\u2019s most complicated joints, presented challenges to robot design. However, Leonardo\u2019s principles enabled engineers to construct a suitable model. It is from these and other experiments that the first prototype for robotic surgery was developed.And so in 1998, the first da Vinci robot-assisted surgery, a heart bypass, was performed, inaugurating a career for the telepresence tool that has resulted in over 200,000 surgeries performed by a robot designed in part with the help of Leonardo\u2019s anatomical studies. Each of these procedures was safer, faster, and less invasive compared to the non-robotically-assisted alternative, and each patient has Leonardo\u2019s work to thank for their speedy and comfortable recovery. As of 2009, there are over 1,600 da Vinci robots installed worldwide, performing minimally-invasive laparoscopic surgeries to treat heart, prostate, kidney, bladder, and testicular issues, from malignant tumor removal to complete organ transplant. **Sources**Keele, Kenneth D., \u201cLeonardo da Vinci\u2019s Influence on Renaissance Anatomy,\u201d Medical History 8, no. 4 (1964): 362, doi:10.1017/S0025727300029835Clayton, Martin, \"Medicine: Leonardo's anatomy years,\" Nature 484, no. 7394 (April 19, 2012): 314, doi:10.1038/484314aDa Vinci clue for heart surgeon, BBC News, last modified September 28, 2005, _URL_0_Yates, David R., Christophe Vaessen, and Morgan Roupret, \"From Leonardo to da Vinci: the history of robot-assisted surgery in urology,\" BJU International 108, no. 11 (December 2011): 1708-1713, doi: 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2011.10576.xA.

That Prussia, through the will of Bismark, was able to unify them under one flag was due in part to a nationalist zeal ignited in the post-Napoleonic period, and also in part to the declining influence of Austria/Austria-Hungary in the corresponding period. There was a desire by the rulers of the smaller constituent parts of the Germanies to avoid outright conquest by Prussia, as well as a desire to enact social reforms without a revolutionary bloodbath that had swept up France in 1792. The 1830 and 1848 revolutions stoked German liberalism and nationalism, and it took all of Bismark's political acumen to convince the disparate German nation states that the Prussian constitution and military might were worth binding under, vis-a-vie Austrian hegemony (which is why the Prussians fought the Austrian-Prussian war).  Prussian desire for hegemony arose after the 1815 Vienna settlement in part because Prussia feared Austrian, French, and Russian encirclement. The treaty had two outcomes that would shape the rest of 19th century German history: 1) The establishment of the German Confederation, made up of 39 independent states, and 2) the treaty had ceded territory on the Rhine to Prussia. This had put Prussia under considerable internal strain, as geographically, culturally, and politically the west of the new nation was far removed from the Berlin Prussian monarchy. Napoleon's sparking of nascent German nationalism during his conquest of the Rhineland was fanned by the liberalisation of Europe during the period 1820-1848, which the Austrians under Metternich attempted to suppress. Prussia was kept in check by Austrian military and political supremacy  during this period, but as Austria lost political prestige Prussia began to reassert herself, especially when Otto von Bismark became Prussian Chancellor in 1862. Prussia, with the suport and aid of Austria, fought the 1864 Second Schleswig war against Denmark, which gave them control Schleswig-Holstein. Prussia then went to war with the German Confederation, led by Austria, in 1866, with led to the defeat of the Confederation and then to it dissolving as a political entity. in 1867 the Prussians unified the northern german states into the North German Confederation, which had a federal constitution with Prussian monarch as the head of state.The German empire was formally declared at the Palace of Versailles on 18th January 1871, at which point the independent principalities and kingdoms of the North German Confederation, led by Prussia, merged with the south German kingdoms and principalities. At this point the various independent entities that had formally been part of the Germanies became states within the new German Reich, with their own laws, customs, and state legislatures. Central authority in the empire rested with the Emperor and the Reichtag, though the democracy that Bismark, the Prussian prime minister, envisaged was of a limited form, with ultimate power resting in the hands of the German Kaiser, who was also the King of Prussia.Initially the 27 constituent states that formed the newly unified Germany were left to manage their own internal affairs without too much interference from Berlin, as Bismark did not wish to empower the Reichtag with too much power. Over the course of the period between 1871 and 1900 the German state centralised federal control in the hands of the civil service through the State Secretaries, with the effect that even though there was near-universal suffrage in Germany for most adult males, the power of their elected representatives was muted when compared to the bureaucrats who controlled the affairs of state at the behest of the Kaiser.The effect for the 27 state rulers was that their pre-1871 powers were constrained by the 1871 German constitution. All states sent deputies to the the upper house called the Bundesrat, and although all states were nominally equal in the eyes of the law, as Prussia was the largest state in terms of both population and size they had 17 of the 58 seats, which meant they had little difficulty in obtaining the majority they needed to pass favourable legislation.One key area the 27 states maintained their own control was the armed forces, so that the larger states, such as Prussia and Saxony, had their own armies, which in turn was modelled on the Prussian army. This had the consequence that during WW1 many regiments were led, or had a titular head, by members of the royal families from the various states.In terms of the pre-1871 monarchs, Saxony's monarch Fredrick Augustus III abdicated in 1918, turning Saxony into a free state in the Wiemar republic; the same happened with Bavaria, and by the declaration of the armistice on 11th November 1918 all the monarchs who remained in power after 1871 had been removed from power in favour of republican ideals. The reasons for the loss of power are varied, ranging from a general disdain for support of Prussian policies during WWI (in the case of Bavaria and Saxony), to a ground-swell of desire to reform the country after the catastrophic defeat caused by the allies. The monarchical principals of power were discredited in the eyes of the German public by the actions of the ruling elite during the war, even to the point where the Bavarian's sought a separate peace with the allies.Dues to this, many royal titles were abrogated in 1918, with all temporal power being transferred into the hands the people. The Wiemar government did not removed smaller titles, though, and those landowners, including the Prussian Junker class, were still classed as nobility through the Wiemar and Nazi governments. The fall of Germany in 1945 resulted in a complete overhauling of the governance of Germany in the East and West, with the nobility loosing all their privileges in the process. It is also worth remembering that many of the Prussian noble houses were absorbed into present day Poland and the Baltic states, were their estates were seized by the Communists and turned over to state control.So, in summation to your question:Most of the German monarchs, Dukes, and princelings of the pre-1871 era were allowed to remain as heads of state of their respective German state (much like a US governor). Due to the actions of the various monarchies during WW1 when the German Republic was declared in 1918 the states transitioned from monarchies and hereditary rulers to directly elected state legislatures, and the former monarchs either went into exile or were settled into civilian life.If you would like to read further, please check out the books below.Source material: 'The Pursuit of Power: Europe 1815-1914' by Richard Evans'The Army of the German Empire 1870-1888' by Albert Seaton'Contesting the German Empire 1871 \u2013 1918' by Matthew Jefferies*Edits tidying up grammar, punctuation, and readability", "label": 0}, {"content": "The German Empire was created in 1871 when the German Confederation was dissolved and the German Empire was created.

While there are readings of the Iliad that paint the Trojans in a somewhat negative light, I think the most natural readings, and those supported most by later authors, give the Trojans a great deal of glory. And this glorification of a heroic defeat is hardly unique to the Romans--in the debates over English historical identity, for example, the defeated Anglo Saxons won out over the Norman conquerors, and there are rather more statues of Boudicca in Britain than of Suetonius Paulinus.But beyond that, the deeper question is \"why the Trojan War?\" After all the Romans were not Greeks, so why wrap so much identity up in a Greek poem? The answer to this goes back quite a bit farther than the conquest of Greece. During early Greek colonization of the western Mediterranean, Greek cultural products became very popular within Italy. For example, one of the most iconic Greek artistic products are the black figure vases, but the great majority of these have actually been found in Italy, and were originally thought to be created by the Etruscans. This importation of material also included an importation of ideas, and in particular Odysseus became a popular founding figure among many of the Etruscan settlements. The Roman adoption of Aeneas is within this Italian context in which the \"Greek\" figures of the Trojan War became heroic figures within Italian communities.A classic study of the way ethnicity and heroic stories became entangled is *The Returns of Odysseus*, although it is largely from the Greek perspective.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Romans were a conquering people who had conquered many other peoples.

European, Middle Eastern, Chinese, or African? Educated or uneducated? Upper class or lower? All of these have some bearing on the answer, and most of us will only be capable of discussing some. My own work is on the European middle ages, so that's what I'm going to be discussing here. (I think that this is doubly appropriate because I suspect that this post is a response to another post about William Manchester's (contemptible) *A World Lit Only by Fire*.) I hope to show, briefly, that not only were people aware of days, months, and years, but that they were deeply in tune with the rhythms of time. So the day part is pretty easy to address, and I'll start with it. For medievals, whether aristocratic or peasant or burgher, clerical or lay, Sunday was impossible to miss. Work was forbidden, plus there was obviously Mass, and so you'd be hard-pressed to find a person unaware of the day. This speaks to a point that I hope will be clear from this post: Time was governed by the sacred. What about the other days of the week? Here, again, let's look at religious services. The Divine Office, or Liturgy of the Hours( prayers like Lauds and Vespers), differed by the day, and so anyone praying the Hours would necessarily know what day of the week it was. Okay, so that's monks and priests, but what about laity? *Well*, in the later middle ages, we start seeing private devotional books of the Hours made for (wealthy, and usually female) laypersons. That's not to say that the Divine Office and the Mass were the only ways to know what day it was, but they should demonstrate the point, I think.Talking about medievals not knowing the month is a little peculiar to me because the idea that we somehow know the seasons better than people who lived and died by agriculture is, I mean, it's just not tenable. Uneducated people still understood seasons. Educated people, of course, also understood seasons. There's this fascinatingly complex methodology of medieval *computus*, the rationale of figuring out when Easter would be based on the lunar cycle. In a world where you couldn't Google when the full moon would be, the mechanisms for working it out were really arcane and complicated and should really dissuade us from thinking that nobody knew the cycle within the year. Also, we should consider the very old chant for the moveable feasts from Epiphany - in January each year, a priest (or deacon) would literally announce to the congregation when feasts would fall during the upcoming year, what day and month. So, I mean, that presumes an awareness of what days and months are.I suppose that years are a little harder for me to talk about, because so much medieval time is sacred and cyclical and the procession of years doesn't fit quite as easily into that. However, there was the whole millenarian thing, where a bunch of people thought that the world would end in the year 1,000, and then again in 1,033. Jay Rubenstein cites this as a major contributing factor to the pogroms, and then eventually the First Crusade. It was a really widespread belief. So I mean we can also look at chronicles and annals that say \"In this year, this happened,\" but if you want to really see \"average folk\" getting worked up over what year it was, look at millenarianism.Obviously, I'm coming at this from the perspective of medieval religious culture, because it's what I know. I hope that this has helped to prove that no, people didn't go around blithely unaware of what day or year it was. I also realize that it's fairly surface-level, and I'll be happy to go more in-depth if I wasn't clear about something.

It's about a guy (Martin Guerre) in 15th century France who leaves his wife, family, and home town to join the army. Out of nowhere, he comes back several years later. Over the course of about four years, his family realizes that it isn't actually Martin Guerre, but an impostor. They had a trial, and the impostor almost got away with the act- but the real Martin Guerre showed up at the last minute and proved who he was.In terms of how the impostor did it, he had several things going for him. First, he looked like Martin Guerre, and several people mistook him for Guerre when he neared the town. Second, he was clever enough to glean important information from the various townspeople. It is possible that he also met Martin before entering the town, and it has been suggested that Martin's wife worked with the impostor, but neither of these can be proven. What ultimately tipped off the family was a cultural mistake. Guerre's family were Basques that had moved to France within Martin's lifetime, so they still practiced Basque customs. One of these involved never selling your inherited land, which the impostor attempted to do. This caused a feud between the impostor and Martin's uncle, which eventually led to the trial. Other things happened as well- the town's cobbler noticed that the impostor's feet were smaller than Martin's, for instance. I'm not sure how common this was, but we can see a rough idea of how identity was confirmed. Visual recognition seems like it was the primary means of identification. Failing this, the only way to tell was through a person's local or cultural knowledge.

It's such a great question, in fact, that **there is no definitive answer to it.** (Maybe you can be the person who [trawls the Nixon tapes](_URL_3_) and finds the answer.)Before I start the discussion, it might be worth pointing out something that you (well, maybe not *you* in particular /u/TrynnaFindaBalance, but *you* collectively, as in everyone reading this) might have overlooked.What's obvious to us today, with the benefit of hindsight, was not clear to Nixon or anyone else in the United States in early 1972. We know the results, and so we have an artificial assurance that because things turned out they way they did, they *must* have turned out that way. Living in the moment is to live in uncertainty.At the start of 1972, opinion polls showed Nixon and the various Democratic contenders in a close contest. [Sen. Edmund Muskie was considered a strong candidate](_URL_5_), and Nixon feared facing Alabama Gov. George Wallace (who was ultimately incapacitated in a May 1972 assassination attempt). At the start of the year, when G. Gordon Liddy and Attorney General John Mitchell discussed the campaign to harass and sabotage the Democratic Party, Nixon's wide victory wasn't yet apparent. That would come later.It's also important to remember that the June break-in \u2014 for which Gonzales, Barker, McCord, Martinez, and Sturgis became infamous \u2014 was only part of the campaign approved by Nixon's backers (including Liddy). That campaign also included wiretapping and other kinds of snooping. **Remember that Nixon himself may not have been aware of the exact activities: It was the coverup that got him in trouble.**But that doesn't get to your key question: \"What were the burglars after?\"There are *a ton* of fun theories about this. The most popular theory is that Nixon believed that Democratic National Committee chairman Lawrence O'Brien had some dirt on a loan given by billionaire Howard Hughes (yes, of Spruce Goose and \"The Aviator\" fame) to Nixon in 1969. Some of that money, [according to reporting by \"60 Minutes,\"](_URL_0_) went to paying for frills at Nixon's Key Biscayne home.[E. Howard Hunt](_URL_2_), who hired the burglars, told the *Miami Herald* in 1997 that they were actually looking for ties between the Democratic National Committee and foreign governments. They were searching for evidence of foreign campaign contributions (something that might be familiar to Americans lately), which would make great dirt in the election that year.\u201cWhat we were looking for is the same thing every congressional committee is looking for today, which was evidence of illegal foreign contributions,\u201d he told *Herald*. \u201cThat was the rationale for going in there. We\u2019d heard rumors that both the Vietnamese and Fidel Castro were inserting funds illegally into the Democratic National Committee. And the idea was to look at the books, photograph them, in and out, and that\u2019s it. It didn\u2019t seem like such a deal to me. You know, I\u2019d been doing that stuff for years, a \u2018black-bag job\u2019 into other embassies. But you know, I didn\u2019t have skilled people.\u201dIn 2001, [Liddy testified that the burglars weren't after anything political](_URL_4_): They were actually looking for photographs that put the wife of White House counsel John Dean into a call-girl ring. Contemporaneous rumors held that the motive behind the burglary was to find evidence held by the Democrats that linked Nixon to various assassination attempts made by the United States against Fidel Castro. A lot of those rumors stemmed from the fact that the Watergate burglars had deep ties to anti-Castro plotters, and some Americans reveled in the idea that the nation's dirty tricks had come home to roost.[Columnist George Will has an interesting theory](_URL_1_) that ties the motive to events happening in the days surrounding the burglary. One year before the break-in, the *New York Times* began publishing the Pentagon Papers. Will has suggested that Nixon was worried that the Papers would expose Nixon's 1968 role in sabotaging peace talks related to the Vietnam War. Nixon's successful sabotage of those talks, revealed only in the past few years, violated the Logan Act of 1799. Regardless of the motive, it seems likely that Nixon himself had no particular knowledge of the June break-in, but he did know broadly about a campaign of \"dirty tricks\" against the Democratic Party to hamper Democrats' efforts to fight him in 1972. And as I said before, it wasn't the break-in that ultimately forced Nixon to resign: It was the cover-up.

First, it sets out 1900 as the point by which the image of the hillbilly/redneck/poor white southerner had gelled in the American imagination (the quote is from a New York publication). Second, it focuses our attention on a particular sub-region of the American South, that is, on [Appalachia](_URL_1_) (and as John Otto points out, the oft-overlooked/morphed into 'western Appalachia' [Ozarks](_URL_0_)). The place of Appalachia in American settlement and economic history, and its function in 19th century literature, roll into the stereotypes we know today--including the myth of rampant incest.Already by the early 19th century, Appalachia was developing a reputation as the \"backwoods\" of America from the eastern seaboard. Part of this was emotional: as white Americans geared up to force Native Americans further and further west, the backwoods served as a buffer zone or no man's land of protection. Part of this was geographic: duh. But part of this was economic, and on its way to becoming an enduring culture.Scholars following Otto use the term \"plain folk\", and sometimes \"plain folk agriculture\" to stress its economic origins. Characteristics included small-scale farming in forest clearings, free-ranging pastoralism, and geographically isolated homesteads. But not socially isolated: >  Each farmstead belonged to a dispersed rural neighborhood, or community, whose members were united by friendship, marriage, and kinship. Though dispersed over several square miles, the members of a community called on their friends, relatives, and in-laws for aid in clearing land, gathering crops, shucking corn, collecting livestock, slaughtering animals, and building log houses.  >   Frequently, a church was the focus of a community, and many communities adopted such Biblical place names as Pisgah, Hebron, and Gilead.  The county seat towns, the churches, the schools, and the rural neighborhoods were the physical setting for social and recreational life. The simple pleasures of court sessions, church meetings, and neighborly socializ- ing did much to overcome the spartan material conditions of life. Folks owned modest amounts of property and pursued a self-sufficient life style which left little room for material luxuries. They fashioned their own agricultural tools, household furnishings, and clothing, and they bought little more than salt, ammunition, ironware, and the occasional book.This is rather a vision or a version of the \"yeoman farmer\" stereotype, almost pioneer-like, and before the Civil War its presence was hardly limited to Appalachia (and, again, the Ozarks). But by 1820, eastern writers were recognizing that the urbanizing North and turn towards plantations in the south were crafting a divide. As Anne Newport Royall, editor of the Maryland proto-feminist magazine *The Huntress* wrote in 1826: >  On the bosom of this vast mass of mountains . . . of Virginia . . . there is as much difference between the people of the western states and those in the east as there is between any two people in the union...these present a district republic of their own, every way different from any people.The impression of difference was being communicated eastward by the pens of travelers, but even more so by the propaganda of revivalist missionaries seeing the backwoods as fertile ground for evangelization. As America spiraled towards civil war, too, northern antislavery writers crafted an view of Appalachia as a bastion of white abolitionism. Not entirely unrooted in reality, at least through the 1830s, this highly charged image depended on Appalachians as poor white people either victimized by slavery or opposed to it with fiery religious zeal. (To say nothing of, you know, black Appalachians and slave-owning whites...)Around and after the Civil War, two economic developments isolated the Appalachian backwoods both physically and culturally. First, the construction of railroads created, you might say, \"winners and losers\" out of Appalachian towns. Where the tracks went, David Hsiung argues, residents stayed both economically and *emotionally* connected to both Northern and deeper-Southern culture. In the deeper South, plain folk agriculture evaporated with the evolution into larger cotton-farming \"post-plantation\" plantations, essentially. But the *mountains* of Appalachia are not conducive to that pattern of planting. Plain folk agriculture *and the society/culture that accompanied it*, described above, lived on in the mountains.The over 100 known accounts of outsiders Describing And Defining Appalachia from before the Civil War show their influence in the fiction of the day, and even the titles are revealing: *Wooing and Warring in the Wilderness*, *Fallen Pink, or a Mountain Girl\u2019s Love*, *Sut Lovingood\u2019s Yarns.* By 1860, writers are already trafficking quite profitably in the uneducated, backwoods, raw, yokel stereotype.One thing that almost never comes up on AskHistorians is the impact of the Civil War on American *culture*. In fact, the expanding rift leading up to the war and then the war itself caused Americans to pretty seriously reassess what \"America\" was in all its (white) diversity and regional cultural pride. (You can tie this into the broader nationalist-imperialist movements in the late 19th century west, too). Literary scholars call one result of this, awesomely, the \"Local Color\" body of literature; Mark Twain is probably the most famous writer who gets retroactively caught in this net, but you can also think of all the pioneer literature, too. *Sut Lovingood's Yarns* and its ilk paved the way for the particularly Appalachian vein of Local Color.John Fox and Mary Murfree (writing, of course, as Charles Egbert Craddock; a *lot* of Local Color authors are women writing under men's names) were two of the major names driving home the culture of backwoods Appalachia at the end of the 19th century. In 1800, plain folk and their isolated homesteads with a strong central community had been somewhat distinctive but also normal. By 1900, railroads and changing economy had not only made the way of life an aberration, but had highlighted the *isolation* of it all. Geographically (railroads bypassed; terrain hard to travel), economically, and culturally isolated from the rest of the US...which focused even more attention on the isolation of individual farmsteads from each other. Fox's enormously popular body of work, in particular, highlighted the effects of this isolation enduring over time: depravity, drunkenness, slovenly personal hygiene, and incest.Writers told stories of large, isolated families struggling through romanticized but dire poverty that audiences across the rest of the U.S. ate right up. Allen Batteau's *The Invention of Appalachia*, sees this time period--leading up to that first mention of \"hillbilly\" in eastern print--as the rest of America using the (white) poverty, perceived simplicity, and lack of morality in backwoods Appalachia to define itself against: *this is what we don't want to be*.The evolution of Appalachia and the Ozarks into the internal white American other was long in the making. And once fully formed, it managed to revitalize with each generation. 1910s-30s scholarship on the folklore, religion, lifestyle that painted Appalachia as almost a foreign land sometimes. The resulting Depression-era turn to Appalachian music, arts and crafts, dancing, old women's wisdom, as America's \"old-fashioned, original\" folk tradition that modernity had wiped away elsewhere.  Complaints about white migrants' \"strangeness,\" their too-tight family ties and inability to integrate into wider communities, and their inability to understand laws and how to follow them arose with major migration north after World War II. The war on poverty from the late 1960s highlighted the \"white working class\" of Appalachia as its balance on the \"inner city.\" In the early 1970s, CBS had the sterling lineup of Beverly Hillbillies, Green Acres, and Hee-Haw to communicate the (more family-friendly) stereotypes of Appalachia to audiences on an unprecedented scale. By the 1990s, Anne Shelby argues, the descent of the Appalachian stereotype (including that *other* type of \"family friendly\") into mass-comedy derived its staying appeal both inside and outside Appalachia from four basic points:* It's okay to be a redneck* I used to be a redneck and thank goodness I'm not anymore* I'm okay because I'm not like *those* rednecks* At least someone is worse off than me* \"If it wasn't funny, it would be scary as hell\"And so the stereotypes consolidated in the late 19th century of backwoods Appalachia as isolated, poor, too-close families live on as the nonexistent white America that makes actual white America feel a little bit better.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The South was historically a place where incest was common.

You could try running, but the royal palace is a compound surrounded by a 26ft-high wall and rather extensive territory. [1]Human sacrifice is relatively widespread throughout history, with well-known examples in the Vikings, Aztecs, Incas, Greeks, etc. However, retainer sacrifice - sacrifice of servants to accompany monarchs after death - is more rare. Perhaps most famous of these come from the First Dynasty of Egypt, but the practice was relatively short-lived. [2]In the Shang Dynasty, retainer sacrifice served a similar purpose as in Egypt - to provide the deceased monarch with the luxuries they enjoyed in life, and the Shang are not alone in this practice in China. [3]Retainer sacrifice goes hand-in-hand with R\u00e9nj\u00ec \u4eba\u796d, the practice of killing prisoners - primarily male Qiang captives - in the worship of spirits or, more commonly, male ancestors. [4] The higher the status of the individual, the more people were killed; rulers would usually offer 10 of these sacrifices for \"normal\" worship. [5]These sacrifices were quite brutal and included beheading, dismemberment, beating, taking blood, burning, burying alive, drowning, and drying. I'm afraid it's not looking too good for you so far, my friend.Shang rulers were both absolute monarchs and the high priest, overseeing the two most important enterprises of Shang times - war and sacrifice, primarily the aforementioned R\u00e9nj\u00ec. [6] Their tombs contained many of victims of R\u00e9nj\u00ec, and one tomb in Anyang uncovered more than 700 skeletons, some decapitated and others buried alive. [7] Large numbers of retainer sacrifices have also been found in the tombs of other kings and nobles. [8]These victims were well-organized in various pits and showcase both regular sacrifices and hundreds of skeletons arranged in the king's tomb.Looks like you're dying, and likely in a brutal manner. However, if you're closer to the end of the Shang dynasty, you might be in luck!During the decline of the Shang dynasty, human sacrifice was drastically reduced. You see, the Shang didn't practice institutionalized slavery, so sacrifice was the only way of using all the prisoners they captured in war. Once slavery became a more attractive option throughout the region, sacrifice of captives decreased. [3]**Sources**[1] Fairbank, John King; Goldman, Merle (2006). China: A New History (2nd ed.).

There are a few times when we hear about actual *well* poisoning as a war tactic, but scholars are frequently skeptical: >  The perilous geographic placement of Svetigrad at the tip-top of a rocky hill [was] good for defense against a siege but very bad for access to plentiful water sources. Drawing out the themes of betrayal, [the author of the primary source record] condemns a local man for knowing exactly how to crush the citizens and soliders of the town psychologically as well as physically. This traitor, the story goes, cast the corpse of a dog into the local well. The town defenders had lost their source of water, and knew they had to give in. >  Whether it really took a local traitor to poison a well or whether the Ottoman army was actually just very strategic at cutting off the defenders' access to nearby water sources is an open question...The second is more plausible, but makes the Ottomans look much more effective so would not work well for the author's polemical purposes.The most infamous and tragic cases of medieval well-poisoning, of course, were not actually cases of well-poisoning at all. The Black Death in particular, but also other periods of violent economic/political upheaval, led to mass accusations of poison/murder against already oppressed groups--lepers in some cases, but more frequently Jews. Which, in turn, led to pogroms, massacres, and massacres-by-arrest-and-execution of the accused. But while these cases have a lot to tell us about medieval *people*, they don't tell us what people thought about wells and how they interacted with them in the aftermath of accusations.But! As the posts in the other thread curve around to, we can get some insight into how medieval people thought about potentially poisoned wells by looking at their attitudes towards *other* poisoned/polluted/supposedly poisoned water sources. Namely, fountains and sewer conduits (including pipes). In these situations, we see a deep and frequent concern for their pollution with animals, dead animals, feces, sludge, and disease--sometimes by accident, especially in the frustrations of suave urban sophisticates dealing with *rustici* (hicks); but sometimes deliberately, as malicious poisoning to target one person or a whole town. What does *not* happen is wholesale destruction of the fountain or system in the aftermath of a pollution event or poisoning case.For example, by 1262, Siena already had a surprisingly advanced water distribution system of fountains and pools, for use in drinking, bathing, and daily life as well as firefighting. That year, a woman was accused and convicted of poisoning the all-important Campo fountain. We know about this case because its financial ramifications were meticulously recorded in the records of the Biccherna, the city chancellry. These recorded include point-by-point accounts of the costs of flaying the convicted poisoner alive and then burning her. They do not include ripping out a fountain or the entire system of fountains and rebuilding them.So if we take Barleti's story of the Ottomans' poisoning the Albanian town's well as a dramatic story (true or not): the \"narrative effect\" of the poisoning is absolutely to shut down the use of the well in the short term. On the other hand, with a longer-term outlook and (surely not coincidentally) the economics and practical logistics of rebuilding an intricate sewer/fountain system, pollution/poisoning through excrement or dead animal bodies could lead to caution and delay rather than immediate destruction.In closing, it's worth pointing out that medieval people absolutely understood the problems of \"dirty water\" from pollution, and that dirty water could be cleansed by boiling. A 14th century letter supposedly from a Spanish doctor to his sons at university in Toulouse rattles off the local water sources that are known to be bad (wells, a river, etc), and then reminds the reader(s) not to drink water from those sources unless it is boiled (\"cooked\"). The danger in a spontaneous pollution/poison case, considering the commonly cited pollutants/poisons of feces and corpses, was the *lack of knowledge.*Further Reading:* If this answer made you think, \"Wait a minute, *pipes and sewers* in the *Middle Ages*?\", then Roberta Magnusson, *Water Technology in the Middle Ages: Cities, Monasteries, and Waterworks After the Roman Empire* (2001) is the book for you.", "label": 0}, {"content": "In ancient times, poisoning wells was a common way to punish enemies.

The Packers (Kerry, his father Sir Frank and his father Robert Clyde - widely known as R.C.) at the time were an Australian media dynasty in the same vein as the Murdochs (Rupert and his father Sir Keith) and the Fairfax family. [1]The Packers originally owned prominent newspapers in Sydney and Melbourne and from there accumulated wealth in both media and other ventures (particularly the Crown Casino chain). Through the middle of the 20th century these projects were quite lucrative and propelled the Packers to wealth and prominence.Kerry Packer particularly was renowned for being a bombastic and intimidating character. In a famous episode in 1991, he was brought before the Australian House of Representatives Select Committee on Print Media to account for his bid to buy competing Fairfax Media (threatening to violate media ownership laws)[2]: >  He overwhelmed the MPs\u2019 questioning by both fair means and foul, simply ruling some areas out of bounds, for example, and sometimes treating the elected representatives with contempt. >   >  \u201cPacker was not just frightening, he was frighteningly smart,\u201d writes Paul Barry. \u201cAs a public performer he was quite breathtaking.\u201d [3]As now former-Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull (who worked for Packer for a time) said: >  \"There is a tendency to see Kerry as a mono-dimensional raging tyrant, the great Citizen Kane type of press baron, always pounding the desk and hurling abuse at minions\" [4]All this information effectively sets up the events of Thursday 3 September 1992, when around 9pm, the only episode of Australia's Naughtiest Home Videos (ANHV) went to air on Channel 9. Packer was known for micromanagement of his television channel when programming went to air, but having grown up in print journalism, it's unlikely he was well involved in the production phases. [5]The show was a one-off twist on Australia's Funniest Home Videos (a common format in the '90s) and consisted of video content submitted by ordinary people, as with other Funniest Home Videos episodes, but with a generally sexual flavour; awkward animal genitalia moments, flaming toilet rolls between buttocks, accidental bare breasts [6]. It had been approved by Channel 9's censor at the time and so was clear to air from a management and regulatory stand point.But when it did go to air, Packer was dining at his home in Sydney and was watching. He was outraged by the content, called the broadcast station directly (where they had a special red phone to take his calls), and famously shouted at the technician who picked up, \"Get that shit off the air!\".As a result, Australia's Naughtiest Home Videos never returned from the ad break. Viewers were instead greeted by a repeat of Cheers. There was no explanation given as to the change in programming at the time.Although this was a historic (and never repeated) moment in Australian television history, the fallout was not actually that great. When it had gone to air, ANHV had only received about 60 complaints, but when the story of Packer's intervention was later propagated, over 600 complaints were received by Nine Media.The offending episode of ANHV was actually broadcast in full 17 years later by Channel 9 in August 2008, with a joke about technical difficulties and Cheers credits inserted in the middle. All the original clips were aired, with the only changes being the removal of some of the presenter's jokes about overweight children, ironically being the content that didn't comply with 2008's media standards rules.Packer was a very colourful character, and there are numerous other anecdotes about his temperament and behaviours (as well as a body of works from books to TV miniseries documenting his life). The story about ANHV is as much about him and the Australian TV/print media mogul age as about television or Nine Media.While I know Wikipedia is not accepted as a source in /r/AskHistorians, I do recommend [the Wikipedia article](_URL_0_) on this particular event as a good consolidated starting point for more information; unfortunately a behind-closed-doors event like this has to be reconstructed from a constellation of anecdotes.[1]: [History of Nine media](_URL_4_)[2]: [Kerry Packer addressing the House of Representatives Select Committee on Print Media](_URL_1_)[3]: [How Packer slipped on Fairfax, with help from Malcolm Turnbull](_URL_3_)[4]: [ABC Australian Story article on Kerry Packer](_URL_2_)[5]: [The moment Kerry Packer blew his stack](_URL_6_)[6]: [23 years ago, 'Australia's Naughtiest Home Videos' was cancelled during its first episode](_URL_5_)", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Nine Network aired Australia's Naughtiest Home Videos in September 1992, a programme so apparently objectionable that it was pulled off the air 24 minutes into its 60 minute run.

Edgar Hoover's [1966 memo](_URL_0_) on the Soviet leadership reaction to Kennedy's assassination online. Unfortunately for present purposes, that is definitely too recent for it to have been subject to proper historical analysis and published on. But I think if we tread carefully with that memo in light of other evidence, especially the parallel situation with Cuba, we can at least get a fuller sense of the Cold War politics involved in reactions to the murder.First of all, it's important to understand *why* Cuba and the USSR were concerned. Lee Harvey Oswald had spent several years in the USSR, had married a Russian woman who then immigrated to the U.S. when he returned, and--only months before the assassination--had spent a significant amount of time in Mexico applying to the Cuban and Soviet embassies for visas. (He was denied.) The dots were there to be connected by any enterprising conspiracy theorist or just a 1960s version of an idle Internet commentator.On the surface, the Soviets reacted as a foreign power paying respects to a fallen leader ought. Russian leader Khrushchev issued solemn remarks about what a loss to the world and international relations was Kennedy's assassination. This wasn't just empty rhetoric, according to Kennedy biographer Robert Dallek--despite early disasters like the Bay of Pigs invasion, many people at the time really did see Kennedy as \"a humanist arguing the case for a rational world,\" as well as a patriotic American, looking at things like negotiations towards nuclear de-escalation.In another symbolic gesture, Khruschev sent his first deputy, Anastas Mikoyan, to participate in Kennedy's funeral procession. The family and the country accepted.According to Dean Rusk's testimony to the Warren Commission, the formal U.S. government inquest into the assassination, the USSR immediately broadcast the news via Radio Moscow (here referred to as Voice of Moscow, borrowing the \"Voice of America\" nomenclature). The commission was actually more immediately concerned with what the Voice of *America* had broadcast *to Russia*, though!Rusk stressed the depth and sorrow of the Russian reaction: >  I think also that it is relevant that people behind the Iron Curtain, including people in the Soviet Union and including officials in the Soviet Union, seemed to be deeply affected by the death of President Kennedy. Their reactions were prompt, and I think genuine, of regret and sorrow. Mr. Khrushchev was the first to come to the Embassy to sign the book of condolences. There were tears in the streets of Moscow. Moscow Radio spent a great deal of attention to these matters. Rusk does go further into American projection of Soviet fears (of being tapped as responsible) on a political level, or at least, what he was able to share. This is important because of interdimensional political chess--understanding how your opponents think you will react, if you are trying to avoid nuclear war, is pretty important for avoiding nasty surprises. Rusk agreed with the idea that the Soviet leadership had a genuine respect for Kennedy and would benefit from his remaining in office: >  I think also that although there had been grave differences between Chairman Khrushchev and President Kennedy, I think there were evidences of a certain mutual respect that had developed over some of the experiences, both good and bad, through which these two men had lived. So that it would be an act of rashness and madness for Soviet leaders to undertake such an action as an active policy. Because everything would have been put in jeopardy or at stake in connection with such an act. It has not been our impression that madness has characterized the actions of the Soviet leadership in recent years. Rusk also cast doubt on the possibility that a radical breakaway wing of the Soviet Communist Party was responsible, pointing out that such a group would make a lot more progress on their goals by, you know, assassinating other Soviets.These points all dovetail with information presented in the Hoover memo:* Immediate Soviet reaction of official mourning* Concern that Kennedy's death was a serious blow to international relations, especially with respect to disarmament* Vocal internal and external Soviet denial of ties with Oswald, they had never granted him citizenship, had just refused him a visa, and so forthBut also, Rusk's implicit point tracks with one of the major thrusts of Hoover's memo. The overall arc of his testimony is to disavow Soviet involvement in Kennedy's murder. The real question he's answering, through *all* of it, is whether they were involved, and he says no. That's the American concern, that's the Soviet concern.That's one of the reasons the Warren Commission works here as evidence. Obviously there is A TON not being said, and probably a good share of truth bendings and outright lies. But the *public perception* that the testimony is trying to create is important evidence in and of itself. (Especially if you consider that the KGB probably had sources telling them about internal classified dealings as well).Cuba's involvement was perhaps a hotter issue. It was heightened because the U.S. and Cuba did not really have established diplomatic ties at this point in time. The small matter of the U.S. assassination plots against Castro headlined by, oh, the U.S. Attorney General, that would be the brother of the murdered president, might have had something to do with that along with heightening the tension...Cuba, says Rusk, was an unknown quantity.And actually, that past bloodstain was the reason for a lot of U.S. concern. Both Robert F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson worried that Castro or Castro supporters were part of a conspiracy behind Oswald. According to Schlesinger and Holland, Bobby Kennedy in particular tortured himself endlessly over the assassination, believing his role as AG in the anti-Castro plots had gotten his brother killed in revenge. It probably didn't help that an interview with Castro published in numerous U.S. newspapers just that September quoted him on the assassination plots to the effect of: >  CASTRO:  Ware prepared to fight them and answer in kind. United States leaders should think that if they are aiding terrorist plans to eliminate Cuban leaders they themselves will not be safe.U.S. official response, obviously, followed Warren Commission testimony that Cuba likewise had had no involvement.Overall, though, the official response was for the Soviets to declare their deep sadness, and America to insist on a lack of Soviet conspiracy. Those two points, in addition to being honest, definitely give an undercurrent of worry on both sides that *if* the Soviets were to be found at blame (justly or not), the result could be devastating to everyone.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Soviet Union's reaction to Kennedy's assassination was to reaffirm its commitment to the United Nations Security Council and to the international order.

Of course, plenty of people have informal/courthouse/Vegas weddings, but the idea of a wedding has changed from a small gathering of family and close friends in the home of the bride's or groom's parents to a large, fancy, ceremonial affair. In 1840, Queen Victoria of Great Britain married Prince Albert. The bride wore a white satin dress, which immediately set the standard for brides-to-be who could afford white material and had the means to keep it clean. Prior to that (and for many years following for most women), women were typically married in their \"best\" dress, which was often made of a dark material so it could double as a funeral dress for those occasions. The rise of a (White) middle class in the United States meant that more women could aspire to the trappings of wealth, such as a big fancy white dress, catered dinner, a confectioner-made (rather than homemade) cake, engraved invitations, and such. Professions arose or adapted to meet these needs - florists, caterers, etc. Much of the modern wedding industry is based on this desire to imitate the formality and wealth the rich and aristocratic displayed on a daily (or at least frequent) basis -- allowing the bride and groom to be \"rich for a day.\" (As someone who studies the history of media and technology, I have to point out here the influence of the invention of photography and the spread of newspapers, whose \"society pages\" helped circulate images of wealth widely.)If you are interested in reading more, Carol Wallace's *All Dressed in White: The Irresistible Rise of the American Wedding* (Penguin, 2004) is a pop history of weddings in the U.S.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The American Civil War was a time of great social upheaval and change.

One of the problems with saying that slavery is a near continuous element through history or culture is you have to ask yourself exactly what you mean by slavery. Today, most people have a pretty clear idea in their head of what slavery means. It probably involves African descended people being whipped by white masters all while working in Antebellum American cotton fields. These people are probably enslaved from birth to death, and their children are automatically slaves as well. This kind of slavery was not the kind of slavery that existed for all time, so drawing a continuous like through history isn't really right. This is a specific kind of slavery called **Chattel Slavery,** which treated the slave as actual property which their owner could basically use or dispose of as they saw fit. But what else is slavery? If you travel back to the 14th and 15th centuries you might find that what is slavery and what is not slavery isn't so clear. Most societies in this time still considered the women and children of his household to be almost like his property. **Coverture**, a legal construction in English common law allowed all of a wife's property to be treated as if it was the husbands property. They were a single legal entity under the law. The same went for his children. Society and common law also expected a woman to follow the orders of her husband, work in his household, birth him children, and submit to him sexually. Her husband could beat her, within some socially acceptable level of violence, and the concept of spousal rape was completely alien. A woman might not be able to travel without her husbands permission. Is this slavery? At this same time, and even through the late 1700s there are also people who sell their labor or are forced to labor as a punishment. We usually call these **Indentured Servants**. But a close look at indentured servitude contracts reveals how punishing they could be. The contracts often stipulate many years of hard labor, and often carries stiff penalties for refusing to follow your master's orders which extend the contracts  years more. You can imagine these were abused. Masters often beat their servants, subjected them to sexual abuses and rape, and gave them little to no money or sustenance. Some might say, well they entered into the contract willingly, but what does willing in this case mean? A young woman had no real rights of her own since she was a member of her father's household as discussed above, so he was free to sell her as a servant if he felt she did not have any marriage prospects. Young men in large cities like 16th century London suffered from rampant work shortages and often found themselves put in the situation of either selling themselves into servitude, starving, or going to jail. Is this slavery? What about the poor peasants? By the 15th centuries **Serfs** were becoming rarer, but they still existed into the 19th century as well. A serf was a person who was bonded to the land he worked on for a master for the term of his life. The serf could not leave the land without permissions and effectively worked for free; though, they could often keep some portion of their labor and was entitled to some protections. Is this slavery?I do not seek to answer if these are slavery or not, though I do hope you have thought about what it means to be enslaved and what slavery is. I only really sought to illustrate a very important concept: Slavery is an incredibly broad term that describes many different social conditions over many different time periods. While it may seem on the surface that there is a long thread of slavery going back to, and likely beyond, the Roman empire, this isn't really the case. Slavery for African people in the American colonies did not start how we usually envision it. The first African slaves in the American colonies had more in common with Indentured Servants than the Antebellum slave. They usually lived in their own part of town, could legally own property, and were entitled to freedom. But the condition of the non-white slave degrades over time until it more closely resembles what we recognize taking place in cotton fields. What is clear though, is that chattel slavery of the late 18th and 19th centuries had taken on a new far more sinister characteristic that these earlier forms of forced labor did not have. While wives, children and indentured servants may have been subjected to great depravities at the hands of their husbands, fathers and masters, they were still people in the eyes of the law. **An African descended slave in America at this time was considered literal property, sub-human, and had almost no legal rights**. They could effectively be murdered at will by their masters, though there were some social protections against this. By the 1850s, most American states had passed laws making it impossible to free slaves, outlawing the teaching of slaves, and removed most any remaining protections slaves may have had under the law. So why does slavery seem to suddenly go away in the late 19th century? I'd disagree with that question. I don't think you can consider the abolition of slavery to be quick. In both England and the American Colonies/United States people had been pushing for abolition since at least the 1500s. This is about the limit I'd feel comfortable discussing, but I have to imagine the struggle for abolition among the legislature types goes back further. More importantly, this kind of thinking ignores that **the Abolition movement begins with the first slave**. We cannot only look to the actions of benevolent white abolitionists. When speaking of American history this generally means people in Africa. Enslaved people in Africa, captured by Africans, and sold to Portuguese resisted becoming enslaved. They resisted being put on boats. They resisted on the boats. They resisted when sold in the American colonies, and they resisted until they could resist no more. Without the constant resistance and agitation of enslaved people there would have been no abolition movement. Furthermore, freed slaves fought tirelessly for the abolition of their sometimes literal brothers in bondage. There were also European descended people fighting for abolition. **Quaker settlers** in North American and the Caribbean during the 17th century decried all forms of slavery and forced labor wherever they encountered it. Quaker societies were vital to the early struggle for freedom and played an important role in shaping public discourse through the late 18th century. It is also worth noting that indentured servitude has largely died off on its own by the 1760s in the American Colonies. The rising availability of enslaved black people and massive growth in jobs reduced the need for unskilled white labor. The debates surrounding abolition grew through the 18th and 19th centuries. People like the escaped slave **Frederick Douglass** toured the United States and Europe in the 1840's and 50's speaking out against slavery. Abolition groups and newspapers grew in popularity in the north, and political movements moved towards restricting slavery, often seen as the first step towards ending it. There are also small legal steps taken to weaken slavery. The British Empire began to close the slave trade in 1807, and in the same year the US Federal government outlaws the importation of slaves. Northern states introduced laws that gradually freed slaves early in the 1800s. In the 19th century the movement towards abolition grows for many reasons that I will try to briefly summarize. The United States of the early 1800's was a Republic moving towards greater Democratic reforms. In 1790 any naturalized white male could vote. Subsequent and through the 1840's property requirements begin to be relaxed and more and more white men gain the right to vote. With this comes the question of what it means to be a citizen, and what it means to not be a citizen. If a citizen if a free white male then an enslaved black person was a kind of anti-citizen. Some people who became associated with the **Free Soil Party** in the 1840s believed that slavery should be contained and eventually die off to allow free white men to spread into the west. In their mind slavery not only morally debased white people by making them lazy, but it kept other free white men from gaining economic independence. Free Soilers and others who wanted to restrict slavery clashed with Southern Democrats who wanted to expand slavery over issues like the Annexation of Texas, the War with Mexico, and the Kansas-Nebraska Act from the 1840's through the 1850's. By the time slavery is formally abolished in 1865, the struggle for freedom has been going on for hundreds of years. Its end may seem sudden, but it was a long process taking place in fields, in houses, in courts, in legislative chambers, on the high seas, and in Africa. Slavery also cannot be viewed as a single condition persisting through all time. Slavery is a term that means many things in many places. **Further Reading**Manisha Sinha - The Slave's CauseDavis - Inhuman BondageIra Berlin - Generations in Captivity", "label": 0}, {"content": "The abolition of slavery was a major event in the history of the world.

White wrote one of several articles about the event and all that immediately followed.  The final piece in the issue was titled \"For President Kennedy, An Epilogue\", and in it came the roots of the \"Camelot\" myth.Mrs. Kennedy was quoted as saying:\"When Jack quoted something, it was usually classical, but I'm so ashamed of myself, all I keep thinking of is this line from a musical comedy.  At night, before we'd go to sleep, Jack liked to play some records; and the song he loved most came at the very end of this record.  The lines he loved to hear were:  *Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment, that was known as Camelot.*\"She went on:  \"Once, the more I read of history, the more bitter I got.  For a while, I thought history was something that bitter old men wrote.  But then I realized history made Jack what he was.  You must think of him as this little boy, sick so much of the time, reading in bed, reading history, reading the Knights of the Round Table, reading Marlborough.  For Jack, history was full of heroes.  And if it made him this way -- if it made him see the heroes -- maybe other little boys will see.  Men are such a combination of good and bad.  Jack had this hero idea of history, the idealistic view.\"She returned to quote the musical again:  \"*Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment, that was known as Camelot* -- and it will never be that way again.\"Theodore White continued his epilogue detailing her future, as well as reminding his readers of the Eternal Flame marking President Kennedy's grave in Arlington National Cemetery, before ending his piece with \"For one brief shining moment there was Camelot.\"To a nation grieving a President assassinated barely a fortnight before, these words struck a chord, partially because the musical in question had been a remarkable hit.  The show, written by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe, opened less than a month after the 1960 election which elevated Kennedy, and after 873 performances (and two previews), closed on January 5, 1963, less than a year before the assassination.  The original cast album, starring Richard Burton and Julie Andrews (fresh off her success in *My Fair Lady*), was the highest selling LP in the country for over a year, which meant that almost every home with a phonograph would have heard the song Mrs. Kennedy was quoting.  In a year which the singles charts were topped by Elvis Presley, Ray Charles, Shirelles, and many others, the Broadway cast album for *Camelot* reigned on the LP charts.For Mrs. Kennedy to quote a well-known lyric of such optimism in one of the most widely-read publications, less than two weeks after burying her husband, spoke deeply to a nation that was reeling from the tragedy.  She tapped into the zeitgeist of the nation, and responded with Alan Jay Lerner's lyrics in just the right way.  Some have considered that interview a well-calculated insurance that her husband would not be posthumously slandered (at least in the public's eye).  It has been reported that the editors wanted White to edit that portion out, but Mrs. Kennedy insisted that it remain.  There is little evidence otherwise that the musical was well-loved by the first family, but it does book-end John F. Kennedy's presidency fittingly.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Other Kennedy-related articles and features in the issue include:A Letter From the Publisher by C.D.

It fundamentally altered the way America looked at criminal psychology, and it definitely had its effects on culture and politics as well.  After execution of Charles Guiteau for his assassination of President Garfield, it was becoming more and more accepted that Guiteau was insane. A smaller group began claiming he couldn't fully be held responsible for his actions. These people called themselves \"alienists\".After Leon Czolgosz gunned down McKinley in Buffalo just 20 years later, alienists began to take interest in Czolgosz's mental state. *Murdering McKinley* follows Dr. Vernon Briggs as he tries to determine if Czolgosz is insane or not. Ultimately, he does not come up with a compelling case to cast doubt about Czolgosz's sanity but it was one of the first major cases on a national level where psychological analysis of the suspect played a major role. [Twenty years later](_URL_3_) Briggs would get a law passed in Massachusetts that formalized the psychological aspect of criminal justice as we know it today. The word \"alienist\" fell out of favor and it became more proper to refer to doctors like Briggs as \"psychologists\". If you're looking at this from a political and cultural standpoint I think the best place to start is [Teddy Roosevelt's telegraph](_URL_2_) upon hearing that McKinley had been shot (at that point McKinley was still alive):  >  \"I am so inexpressibly shocked  &  horrified that I cannot say anything\"There was a similar feeling of shock and disgust during the Guiteau trial after Garfield's assassination as well. Several political cartoons [made him look like a monster](_URL_0_) or a [gun wielding maniac](_URL_1_)There was a sense of panic and dread with all of these assassinations, the Lincoln assassination lead to the trial of confirmed and alleged co-conspirators including the ~~probably~~ *maybe* innocent Mary Surratt who owned the boardinghouse that Wilkes and co. were staying in. She was executed which was apparently controversial even at that time as they was a campaign to have President Johnson grant her clemency.I think a fitting way to end this is to go over the stranger-than-fiction life of Robert Todd Lincoln. As Lincoln's son he was one of the first people to see his father's corpse after the assassination. He was inspired by his father and became a prominent figure in the Republican party, becoming Secretary of War under President Garfield. He was with Garfield when he was shot by Charles Guiteau. Later in life, he was attending the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo when a panic came over the festivities and he learned that just a few buildings over President McKinley had been shot. Allegedly, Lincoln responded to another Presidential invitation later in life with this response: \"No, I'm not going, and they'd better not ask me, because there is a certain fatality about presidential functions when I am present.\"", "label": 0}, {"content": "The assassination of Abraham Lincoln in 1865 was the first of three assassinations of American Presidents between 1865 and 1901.

By the eleventh century, there are some very powerful large-scale landholders (including monasteries, although at least in urban areas, sometimes even a monastery was controlled by an aristocrat), a few small landowners hanging in there, and then most of the population would have been *paroikoi* or dependent peasants: tenant farmers. For the powerful landowners, including monasteries, tax collection was mostly a game of tax *evasion*. Tax collectors remained a popular bogeyman of Byzantine literature and art as they had been in Roman times, and this hostility was mirrored by practice. Owners might work to avoid periodic visits by imperial tax assessors to revaluate their land at a higher tax amount, pay their taxes using a debased currency, or send someone chasing after a tax collector to steal back the money. (Anna Komnene tells a similar story in her *Alexiad.*)Most Byzantine people, however, were peasants who were responsible for paying their taxes (a) collectively and (b) often indirectly. The tenant farmers paid most of their tax burden to the owner of their land. In a case like that, they would presumably be fairly familiar with the people involved. Otherwise, taxes were levied collectively on a village. This had the advantage, for the peasants, of helping out if one family had a rough year. It had the disadvantage of--one of the reasons for this system--that local land abandoned or unfarmed was still part of the total levy for an area. So people had to cover for each other. But tax evasion was at least sometimes practiced by peasants--or at least, financial documents complain about peasants who simply *disappear* when they know a tax collector is in the area!As for identifying the tax collectors themselves: at least some tax officials, most prominently the *kommerkiarioi* (who, as their name indicates, were involved with regulating commerce), had official imperial seals. [This Google Books preview](_URL_0_) shows a couple of them, although they are both ninth century. Seals were pretty serious business in medieval Europe. The collective payment and indirect payment methods certainly suggest that at least some of the people involved would have been able to recognize the seal for what it was (medieval peasants are, as a rule, stereotyped in contemporary sources as stupid, but at least from later legal sources we can see a good deal of ability to negotiate successfully the demands of a more literate and educated \"elite\" culture).", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Byzantine Empire had a system of tax collectors called \"diocesan tax collectors\".

Flexner's \"Washington: The Indispensable Man\" points to how he was a traditional plantation owner prior to the Revolution when he amassed his wealth. (pg. 37) It took time to realize returns on working capital for farmers. When the money did come in it would be reinvested in the product; land, seed, labor.  Any money removed from this cycle would slow the growth of his estate. Remember too that Washington's wealth was largely the result of his marriage and his accumulation of land. Many of the large estates in Europe that you reference are the culmination of successive generations; each building upon previous successes.

The federal government would have to stop the importation of alcohol (a massive project in and of itself) while also ensuring that its manufacture and sale stopped and stayed that way. This would mean a nation wide policing effort in ensuring that all beer, wine, and spirit producers closed shop and destroyed their leftover stock. Up until this point the federal government had never taken on such a responsibility and it was not clear that the constitution granted the power to do so. Let me know if I've missed the mark and I shall try to clear up any more questions as best I can.Sources: McGirr, Lisa. *The War on Alcohol: Prohibition and the Rise of the American State.* New York: W.W. Norton  &  Company, 2016.Okrent, Daniel. *Last Call: The Rise and Fall of Prohibition.* New York: Scribner, 2010.EDIT:Let's get in to the efforts of the Anti-Saloon League (ASL) and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU). The Anti-Saloon League, as the name indicates, was initially opposed to the institution that served alcohol rather than alcohol itself. The 19th century saloon was a cesspool of gambling, prostitution, and addiction. Alcohol's direct ties to such a seedy organization helped to perpetuate the idea that alcohol was responsible for societal problems like the spread of venereal disease, loss of family income, and domestic abuse. The WCTU used these points to argue that getting rid of alcohol would lead to a better society.These were the two most powerful and influential temperance societies in terms of influencing lawmakers and the voting public to consider the merits of prohibition. This is not to say that they were united in their ideas of how to achieve prohibition. Should they focus on individual pledges of sobriety until there was no one left to drink? Bring up ballot measures at the state and local level? Push for national reform? Many members were outright hostile to a national solution, so they pursued action at the state level. They were quite successful. By 1919, 28 states had some kind of prohibition laws on the books.Then, in 1913, the constitutional campaign was launched which aimed at adding a prohibition amendment to the constitution. This is a stark departure from the previous efforts at the statewide level, and I would argue, that it is because of the success of the Progressive movement in other areas. The 16th and 17th amendments (both passed in 1913) demonstrated that change could be effected nationally in one fell swoop. Similar hopes were held for a prohibition amendment. If the forces of prohibition could win on a national scale, then all lives (so they argued) would be immediately improved without having the uncertainties and the delays that were related to the state-by-state campaign. It also meant that the Prohibitionists did not have to spend their time and money attempting to convince cities (filled with immigrant, working class wets) to give up an integral part of their leisure culture.World War One made prohibition a reality. As the United States entered the war in 1917 everything was turned over to the war effort. People joined war industries, were expected to scrimp and save their food and ration their other consumable goods so that everything possible could be used to win the war. In such an environment it isn't difficult to see how turning good, bread-making wheat into beer would be seen as a waste of resources and actively damaging the war effort. It also didn't help that most of the companies making the beer bore German names such as Pabst, Busch, and Schlitz. Wartime patriotism fueled the prohibition amendment to success under conditions that were wholly unimaginable before the war began. In my earlier comment I made a remark that the 18th amendment \"was crafted\" to address a perceived lack in constitutional authority to regulate alcohol on a federal scale. I was intentionally vague on this point because I felt that it was too difficult to say any one person or organization wrote the amendment. I hope that I have included enough information about the efforts of temperance societies in the 19th, and early 20th centuries to demonstrate that the evolution of their tactics from individual pledges to local and state option laws to full blown prohibition was a factor of their early success and that of the Progressive movement at large.Sources: Same as above, except I have also taken a look at:Rose, Kenneth D. *American Women and the Repeal of Prohibition.* New York: New York University Press, 1996.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The 18th Amendment was an amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

There is actually a perfect example in the Mongol invasion of the Khwarezmid Empire. Initially the Mongols had no intention of attacking the Khwarezmid Empire as they were embroiled in the Invasion of Jin China. When a Mongol trade caravan sent to the city of Otrar was confiscated by the Governar, Inalchuq, Chinggis Khan sent an emissary of three men, two Mongols and one Muslum to the Khwarezmid Shah demanding that Inalchuq be brought to justice. The Shah responded by shaving the beards of the two Mongols and killing the Muslim. Upon hearing this, Chinggis Khan pulled his main forces out of the Jin Empire and invaded the Khwarezmid Empire. In two years it was done. What this goes to show is that the Mongols took diplomatic immunity very seriously and if a nation violated it by harming you in this case they would face complete and utter destruction. This would in most cases also be the case if the nation knew that the Mongols were about to invade as killing the emissaries would only incense the Mongols to more severe massacres and targeted killings. Referring back to the Invasion of the Khwarezmid Shah, the Mongols sent a troop of soldiers lead by Subotai himself, the greatest Mongol General to capture the Shah, in the end he managed to escape to an island in the Caspian Sea where he died.

Thirty-five years later, she might well have added \"and they're not shy about trying.\" Scholars today generally agree that the (recognized then as) unconstitutional theft of voting rights in 1807 was essentially a strategy in white male-led political parties' jockeying for power over the state. However, the specific assumptions and ideologies that made the strategy attractive and effective depended on racism, sexism, nationalism, classism, and good old-fashioned fear.Jan Lewis suggests that the voting rights of New Jersey's black women, white women, black men, and foreign-born residents were initially recognized simply out of revolutionary Americans' commitment to the underly egalitarianism of republican ideals. Irwin Gertzog is more pragmatic, arguing that the added specificity of \"he or she\", first restricted to half the state (1790) and eventually extended to the whole (1797), was already a calculated power ploy. Either way, by 1798 it's clear that the major political parties in the state, the Federalists and the Republicans, recognized especially the voting power of women. Despite the implicit and explicit restrictions on which women could vote--enslaved black women could not; free black and white women who were married could not (because under the law of coverture, they could not own property independently)--contemporary observers were daunted by the scale of potential women voters. A 1791 newspaper article was titled \"The Humble Address of Ten Thousand Federal Maids\"; in 1799, William Griffith similarly estimated, \"of widows and spinsters abovetwenty one, there can not, I imagine be fewer than 10,000.\" In a state where elections could be decided by hundreds or even tens of votes, 10,000 was a daunting number.Furthermore, an idea was developing that we might consider a precursor to identity politics: the belief that groups like \"women\" and \"black men\" were homogenous blocs of voting interest. (But of course white men can have their own opinions.) On one hand, this meant that each party worked *furiously* to court The Woman Voter in hotly contested elections like the Essex County legislator race of 1797 (in which this all-powerful voting bloc amounted *seventy-five* women; I have not seen statistics on their race). On the other, it meant that both parties deeply feared the potential for women, black men, and immigrants to vote for the bad guys. And naturally, *both* parties developed a conviction that women, especially, would turn out for the other. Naturally, too, these parallel developments were both motivated by classism. Federalists worried that it was easier to get women to vote in (Republican-stronghold) towns than in (Federalist-stronghold) cities; Republicans worried that the women more likely to vote were the wealthier, conservative Federalists. They also seem to have simply assumed that black men and women were Federalists, period.Or at least, the party leadership--that is, the men actively seeking to acquire and maintain power--did. A ballot initiative to strip the vote from everyone with at least 50 pounds of property and implement a white male taxpayer-based system failed *miserably* with the general population. There was a definite rift developing between the regular electorate and the power-holders, who had nervously watched the French Revolution tear down waves of political leaders and feared a similar outcome if more widespread participation in American politics.The years between the 1800 election that so focused on winning women voters and 1806-07, when efforts to restrict suffrage kicked back up, witnessed several important developments. First, The Black Voter played the role of the desperately wooed in the 1804 election that The Woman Voter had in 1800, coupled with New Jersey's passage of a gradual emancipation law. Second, newspapers were filled with two-sided worry. Women voters were more likely to commit election fraud (generally accusations that enslaved women or free married women were sneaking in a vote); women were neglecting their proper duties to get involved in politics and society was falling apart; the initial constitutional recognition of women's voting wrights was wrong. BUT it was just that: a constitutional right, so they couldn't be deprived of it without a new constitution, and that wasn't happening. Judith Klinghoffer and Lois Elkis have argued that sexist ideology (they are not really concerned with race, unfortunately) had little to no role to play in these developments; the evidence does not seem to back that up. As with the editorials arguing that the 1776 constitution and 1790/97 amendments were wrong in extending voting rights to women, gender is not silent. But it's not the *driving* or causal factor. Rather, we can see how sexist and racist ideology played into the lust for political power and control, or rather, became the field on which it played out. The assumption that all women and all black people voted the same; the belief that losses were due to election fraud and of course it was women and black people committing the fraud.(For the record: Gertzhog says it was actually mostly men, and there is evidence for this. A lot of the fraud involved keeping polls open days or weeks too long, or waiting until the ballots for an area dominated by the other party were counted and announced so they'd know how many to...scrounge up in order to win. In other words: tactics conceived and operated by party leadership, i.e. white men).But while the initial recognition of voting rights and the first efforts at suppressing them had come from inter-party conflict, it was actually *intra*-party problems that ultimately killed suffrage for property-owning unmarried free black and white women and black men. Once again, the immediate cause was electoral politics and the relentless pursuit of power by white men; the means were racism and sexism.In 1804, the Republican party split both geographically and ideologically into a \"moderate\" and \"liberal\" wing (with the Federalists occupying the other \"conservative\" pole). Among other things, the liberals actually wanted *universal* suffrage, not even connected to property ownership! But naturally, this rivalry played out as \"The Room Where It Happens.\" New Jersey needed a new courthouse, and the dominating Republicans were at war with themselves whether to put it in the liberal north or the moderate south.And a presidential election loomed.The moderates offered a compromise: we'll let you put the courthouse in (Republican) Newark if you agree to restrict voting to white male citizen taxpayers. And this will restore party unity and *we won't support the Federalist candidate.* So in this case, we know exactly what the moderates said to the liberals to get them to sell black and white women's and black men's suffrage down the river: political power.The liberal Republicans' acceptance of this bargain, thus, betrays their own racism and sexism. The desire to stay in power brought into conflict egalitarian republican ideals of equality and contemporary white patriarchy; white patriarchy won *in order for* their political power goals to succeed. Race and sex were not the cause, but were the tools.Further Reading:*  Irwin Gertzog, \"Female Suffrage in New Jersey, 1790-1807,\" *Women  &  Politics* 10 (1990)* Judith Klinghoffer and Lois Elkis, \"'The Petticoat Electors': Women's Suffrage in New Jersey, 1776-1807,\" *Journal of the Early Republic* 12 (1992)* Robert Dinkin, *Before Equal Suffrage: Women in Partisan Politics from Colonial Times to 1920* (1995)* Jan Lewis, \"A Revolution for Whom?

I'm going to try to address all of the questions already asked in the body, so bear with me (barring the question that's outside the purview of my specialty). First, I'm going to confirm a simple fact. Roman soldiers were not allowed to get married. That changed depending on rank, but the rank and file were not legally allowed to get married - so there weren't any wives at home that had to get that painful letter (for the standard legionaries). However, men are men, and people are people- and the vast majority of the time a legion was just garrisoned in a province. People in that situation, naturally, develop relationships, and those relationships were tactfully ignored by the officers, who totally understood the situation these men were in. They weren't allowed to get married, but they WERE in love - the great rock and hard place argument :) The thing about being in the Legion (I'm assuming we're talking about the Principate here - that would be ca. 0-300ish CE) was that once you were in, it was a 25 year commitment. While you got great benefits, those 25 years could be hard on a man - especially when that man wanted a family. So, the natural solution? \"Civil unions.\" Those civil unions were essentially the same as marriage, just without any of the legal entitlements that they would otherwise have- so pretty much, it was marriage. Just without the government recognition. Confusing, eh? :)One big issue with this was that many of the women that the Romans took to wife were natives of the area they were garrisoned in, or even former slaves (The soldier would buy them and promptly free them). Those families would, of course, also go on to have children - and those children called themselves \"*in castris*\" - or \"born in  the camp.\" They generally went on to join the military, just like their parents, and there's a tombstone outside the fortress of *Legio II Augusta* that commemorates a woman, her soldier son, and her husband. The monument itself was erected by her daughter. However...the unfortunate bit is that there are always those damn legalities. We have evidence of seven cases that deemed children born during their father's terms of service to be \"illegitimate.\" Didn't matter if they were citizens or anything - if they were in the legions or *auxilia*, that child had no claim to be the heir of their father, his will, etc. Same with the wives - except the wives *also* couldn't get their dowries back (Legal wives could). Now, on to the husband dying! It's hard to say exactly how they were informed - however, if they were one of these quasi-wives, it would have fallen to the man's tent group (*contubernium*) - who would have known about the quasi-marriage - to let the woman know. The wives either lived right outside the fort in the *canabae*, or even in the room with the rest of the *contubernium*. A quick note here - privacy wasn't such a huge deal until recently, most especially regarding situations with large families (All in one room) or in these cases (8 men in one crowded room - it would have been relatively common for at least one to have a woman in there with him). I do want to stress though (regarding another question in this thread) that the legionaries still maintained strong family ties with both their quasi-wives and their \"illegitimate\" children. The vast majority of tombstones near military encampments are commemorations by the wife or \"unrelated heirs\" (coughchildrencough). We have multiple declarations by these soldiers declaring these children to be their heirs, the children are explicitly mentioned in the wills, and provided for them. As for notifying family (such as parents, siblings, etc), I have no source on that one - I can only speculate that the *contubernum* would send a letter to them as well.---Finally, onto one last question that was addressed - \"Could officers and commanders be married?\" The answer to that is **yes....ish.** The senatorial and equestrian officers were certainly allowed to be married. Legionary centurions were also exempt, however, we have no sources regarding the auxiliary centurions or the decurions - we can *assume* that they would also be exempt, but it's no guarantee. Their wives and children would also have accompanied them, but they (The senators and equestrians, at least - the centurions could and did) were forbidden from marrying *local* women. The senatorial and equestrian officers also spent far less time in the military - it was generally just a step in their career. Now, finally, on to what happened when a soldier died! One of the (many) deductions from the soldier's pay was a contribution to a \"burial fund\" that was organized per century. It wasn't much - it would only cover the costs for a basic funeral - but it was something. I'll go ahead and just quote straight from Goldsworthy for the next bit: >  A funeral procession, carrying the corpse on a couch, would leave the fort or camp, for like many contemporary societies the Romans insisted that burial take place outside the settlement. Once outside, and often on a site running alongside the main road leading to the fort, the corpse would be laid on the couch on top of a funeral pyre, There it would be burnt and, once consumed by the flames the ash of both corpse and pyre gathered into a funerary urn, made sometimes of marble or metal, but most often of glass or pottery, which was then buried. Around the grave site the mourners took part in a funeral banquet. >  [...] The chief mourners were a man's comrades and, as the practice of taking an unofficial wife became widespread, his family. It is doubtful that the burial club paid for more than the most rudimentary of markers for the grave, but many soldiers set aside money to pay for expensive stone monuments. Many tombstones state that they were erected by a man's heirs in accordance with his will. I sincerely hope that helps :) If you have any more questions, please don't hesitate to ask them!**Sources:**-Goldsworthy, Adrian - *The Complete Roman Army*-Scheidel, Walter - [*Marriage, families, and survival in the Roman imperial army: demographic aspects*](_URL_0_)", "label": 0}, {"content": "The wives of Roman soldiers were informed of their husbands deaths by a letter sent by the commander of the legion.

Prestige goods were often precious metals (which the Empire had in Potosi), sea goods (which it had on the Peruvian coast), and most importantly textiles which it produced itself. As well as this, the Incan Empire's economy was largely inward looking and operated in manors which prioritised existing trade routes. Ayllus (part way between an economic system, a kinship system, and a village) coded their labour obligations in Khipus. Ethnographic literature and some \"translations\" show us that these obligations largely consisted of supporting groups they already traded with and things like helping Incan \"traders\" move materials. The movement of materials also can't be clearly seen as trading. Goods were often held in common, either by the ayllu, or in state run store houses. The movement of these goods from location to location was most often the state moving goods from area to area, not the exchange of goods. Material exchange was primarily based on the idea of reciprocity and obligation. For example someone with food will share it with someone in exchange for labour. The Incan state used this extensively in multiple ways; for example if you sent your daughter to work in the capital making textiles your village would get top tier textiles, or if you agreed to move to the opposite side of the empire and police trouble makers you would get vast tracts of land. Now this is not to say outside trade didn't occur, when it did it was usually barter economies or labour obligations. But, that it wasn't a significant factor in day to day life. As a concluding thought, one must remember the ethnic tensions that permeated the region and the harsh terrains which would have made long distance trade very hard to undertake. Main sources:J.V.

The answer to this is yes, conditional upon the musical tastes of the troops obviously. I wrote [this post](_URL_4_) which /u/ForExes kindly dug up(and called excellent! I'm blushing!) awhile ago and I think that answers the popularity aspect of this music. I would also encourage you to read all the comments replying to mine in that answer because the users tidied up a few of my scattered thoughts and incorrect points.The second part of your question is what I'll address here. Again, the answer is yes, and not just allowed, but encouraged. Dave Billingsly, an American medic who arrived in Vietnam in 1970 recounts his first day in Vietnam: > I saw this little club there called Alice\u2019s Restaurant,\u201d Billingsly reported. \u201cThen, a helicopter flew over and it had a peace sign painted on it. It also had a speaker hanging out of it, and they were playing \u2018Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band.\u2019 So, I went into Alice\u2019s Restaurant and everywhere I looked there were dudes with peace signs around their necks, beads, headbands. And I\u2019m thinking to myself, \u2018Where the fuck am I?\u2019This account shows that among the troops, longing for peace was a common sentiment(unless he walked into the pacifist hotbed of the American Army on day 1). This means that many of the protest songs, like Fortunate Son, would resonate with an army of men who didn't particularly want to be there. More directly to your second question, it shows that music was played from the helicopters.A similar account says:  > We\u2019re flying at seven or eight thousand feet listening to AFVN radio\u2014\u2018From the Delta to the DMZ\u2019\u2014 and \u2018Like a Rolling Stone\u2019 comes on. The rim shot and the explosion of the music. I could remember it from 1965 when we used to just turn it up and stop everything to listen to it, but flying over Vietnam, in the cockpit of an airplane, being totally stoned, out of bullet range, looking down at the war, and listening to the music, nothing like it.Again, music is a common theme here(along with pot). I guess the new question is why was music allowed on the choppers? Surely this would be distracting or something? The answer actually links back to your first question about popularity.In the dying years of the war, American troop numbers were being scaled back in preparation for an exit. This led to more men resisting fighting(disobeying orders, fragging officers etc.) and in general, there was the idea that control of the troops might have been lost. The American response to this was to raise morale with material things. Classic capitalists. Meredith Lair in her book *Armed with Abundance: Consumerism and Soldiering in the Vietnam War* writes that the military hierarchy made sure that music was available to the troops at all times. By 1969 she says, a third of troops listened to music for 5 hours a day. About a third of your waking time in a standard 8-16 hour sleep schedule, but I assume soldiers would have less sleep time. 99% of personnel had a radio by 1970, and the American Forces Vietnam Network(who I think is [GOOOOD MOOOOOOOOOORNING VIETNAAAAAAAAM](_URL_2_)?) were broadcasting 24/7. So, music was seen as a key weapon in the war against declining troop morale, to the point where the military even organised Woodstock tribute concerts for the troops, and encouraged them to listen to music. I don't know how loud you'd have to play a song to hear it over the rotors, but by the two accounts above, that's what they did.EDIT: My research process! My first move was to Google \"did vietnam helicopters play music\" because that seemed like it might lead to some obscure article.. Instead it led me to this absolute gold mine of [Yahoo Answers](_URL_0_), where good ole patriots told me that the only thing that helicopters played was machine guns and rockets! They also provided several illuminating answers about Hollywood BS, and one guy suggesting that playing music might give you away to the enemy, as opposed to the sound of your rockets?Anyway, I then found [a chapter](_URL_3_) of [this book](_URL_1_) which is where I got the quotes, the references to Meredith Lair's book, and the general information.

You can sprout, boil, roast, or ferment them, which would give you a range of products including something like pearl barley soups and beer. But, the presence of grindstones indicates that people pretty quickly figured out that they could grind the grain into flour. This increases the glycaemic index dramatically and makes significantly more calories available for human digestion, so it's a more efficient food--though we should note that, as James Scott points out in his most recent book, *Against the Grain* (which I cannot recommend enough), the people doing the earliest farming in the Fertile Crescent and especially the Mesopotamian flood plains lived in extremely rich ecological zones and were not hurting for calories. If these people decided to bake bread, it was not because they were gaining some marginal caloric advantage from the grain but because they liked it.- Finally, we know that both Mesopotamians and Egyptians brewed beer. When you put all this together, what you have is a fairly straightforward picture. Foraging people know every plant and animal and mineral in their areas, so the presence of stands of seed-bearing grasses, which could easily be gathered (one archaeologist found that he could gather enough grain to feed a family for a year in just a few weeks, using a flint-tipped sickle), would have struck them immediately. Once they have this stuff, they experiment with it, and [edit] may have found that it could be roasted on the stalk. They would probably also fairly quickly find that when ground it produced a powder that is edible when combined with water. If you just combine bruised or roughly ground grain with [edit] heated water, you get some kind of porridge. [Edit] Aside from roasting, that form of preparation requires the fewest steps. If you happen to leave that porridge out for a day or two, it'll collect wild yeasts and bacteria, and begin to ferment. It'll bubble, and then turn a bit sour, which many may have found better-tasting than before. If you let it ferment for long enough it'll begin to form alcohol. If at any point you take some of that porridge and slap it on a hot rock, you have a kind of griddle cake. If you take a relatively dry version of that porridge and mix it a lot--knead it, basically--you'll have dough, which would make a somewhat more cohesive flatbread. If you combine all these things, so that you have dough allowed to ferment, and then bake it, well, that's bread. Dolores Piperno, the archaeologist who made the discovery of 22,500-23,500 year old grindstones near the Sea of Galilee, suggests that one particular group of stones at her site is the remains of a hearthstone oven. If it was indeed developed that early--and we have no reason to think it wasn't--then by the time bread fueled the construction of the Great Pyramids or biscuits fueled Akkadian or Babylonian armies, it was already thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of years old.See William Rubel's *Bread: A Global History* for a (very) short introduction; James Scott's book on this topic is *Against the Grain*, though his is mainly about the development of the earliest states and not bread in particular. Search Dolores Piperno in Google Scholar and you'll find her publication history of quite technical papers about the transformation of starch granules found in archaeological digs. And see Delwen Samuel's 1996 paper on beer, available [here](_URL_1_) (pdf warning). Edit: The guy who figured out you could pretty easily harvest grain with a flint-tipped sickle, and that three weeks of work would feed you for a year, was Jack Harlan.

It took three centuries for Christianity to become officially tolerated and protected by Constantine, and nearly another century and a pagan emperor before it became the state religion under Theodosius. Although the empire was seemingly largely Christian by the fifth century, in reality it most definitely was not, as in the undocumented countryside paganism must have survived. From the Syriac historian John of Ephesus we also know that there was a concerted attempt by Justinian to convert tens of thousands of pagans in Asia Minor in the sixth century - the same must be true on a greater scale in even less accessible regions. All sorts of polytheistic beliefs also flourished outside of the Christian empire, which took even longer to overcome and there were plenty of setbacks, so the Christianisation of Europe actually had a very long and troubled history.I'll mainly cover how Christianity became popular within the Roman Empire, but I'll skip over the first three centuries of Christianity as I know very little about it. It is worth noting however that many gentiles did convert to Christianity throughout this period, so much so that by the time of the Tetrarchy Christianity was the faith of 10% of the population (according to Rodney Stark), or less than 3%, to quote the figure suggested by Peter Heather in a recent research seminar. Still, it is clear that pagans converted in large numbers even without state intervention, even when Christianity was under threat from certain emperors. From a purely rational perspective, this seems illogical, but humans are not rational at the best of times, so we shouldn't see history in this way either. Perhaps the earliest converts did so out of social dissatisfaction with their ancestral religion, perhaps it was due to genuine belief, or it happened for more cynical reasons, I don't think we can ever know - the psychology of conversion is complicated, but at least it should be obvious that people's beliefs can change for all sorts of reasons, even if paganism had ancient roots. The same after all can be said for Christianity, which had its roots in Judaism, another faith with a very long history. We also shouldn't see Greco-Roman religions as similar to the more institutionalised Christian church we are all more familiar with, simply because they were decentralised and lacked a central leadership figure. Instead, a huge variety of cults competed against each other all at the same time and innovation was the norm. The same was true for Christianity, as followers of competing doctrines fought against each other through the history of the church, so there was never something as simple as a conflict between Christianity and paganism.So what happened in the fourth century that made Christianity more attractive for converts? I would suggest that there were two main factors: one, that there was a trend for more and more Romans, particularly emperors, to embrace some form of monotheism already, and two, that Christianity was not constantly persecuted, so many individuals knew of Christians and their faith already in a relatively safe environment. For the first point, I thoroughly recommend Paul Stephenson's *Constantine: Unconquered Emperor, Christian Victor* (2011), as he wrote in a very accessible way about the increasing influence of solar monotheism under the Severan emperors and Aurelian, so from that logic, Constantine's change from solar monotheism to Christian monotheism wasn't that strange - he already believed that he was protected and favoured by one particular god, so it wasn't an inconceivable leap of logic for him to embrace Christianity, especially as he already had Christian advisors at his court. By extension, this must have applied to other adherents of similar pagan cults as well. As for my second point, it is always worth stressing that before the Great Persecution of Diocletian Christians can be found in positions of influence. Lactantius, the Christian writer who later lionised Constantine and damned his political enemies as persecutors, was for instance first invited to teach rhetoric at the imperial court by Diocletian, whilst Constantine's mother, Helena, was most likely a Christian already and thus influenced her husband, the Caesar Constantius, to be moderate towards Christian communities in the west despite Diocletian's policy of persecution in the east. At the same seminar I noted above, Peter Heather also made the very good point that we have no positive evidence that Constantine wasn't a Christian from the start, since he may well have hidden his personal faith due to the political situation. When his victories had overturned existing norms, he can then safely out himself as a Christian (having first portrayed himself as a solar monotheist). In any case, once there was a Christian emperor, it became a wise career move for cynical-minded people to convert in order to ingratiate themselves with the new regime, and likewise for the truly devout to be more obvious about their faith in public. It is also often said that Christianity adapted many elements from traditional pagan beliefs and that this made it more popular. To a certain degree, that is correct, since no matter how powerful the Church was it could not regulate the faith of those in the countryside, and as I said, paganism must have been a strong force outside of urban centres throughout the Late Roman Empire, even if very few Christian writers wrote about them (they were generally educated and based in the cities, so they had no interest or need to write about rural bumpkins). However, it would to be too far to say that Christianity was only popular because it appropriated pagan traditions. This is I think very misleading, simply because Romans at the time would not have seen it this way. The vast majority of our sources were written by educated men, all of whom enjoyed a classical education and embraced the idea of *paideia* (the intellectual taste and mentality of an educated aristocracy). If they were Christian, they would have no problem with depicting pagan myths in [churches](_URL_0_) or engage in traditional rituals such as Lupercalia, which annoyed a fifth-century pope but was clearly enjoyed by many. It was tradition and tried-and-tested by their ancestors, so why on earth would people abandon them or see them as contrary to their new faith? Christianity was never particularly good at getting people to live an exclusively apostolic life in any case, despite the many angry diatribes written by men such as Jerome and Pelagius - as always, people are people and they did not want to abandon their past or their habits, a very human instinct that is I think very easy to understand. As such, in the majority of the cases we shouldn't see the appropriation of certain rituals as a deliberate cynical attempt by evil Christians to make their religion more popular, but as the osmosis of cultural norms that transcended the blurry boundary between different beliefs. I'm sure there are many counter-examples, but this is I think a useful way of looking at the big picture.Lastly, it is also worth pointing out that paganism was not persecuted out of existence. Emperors from Constantine onwards did issue laws that increasingly limited state support for cults and sometimes even laws that did make life hard for certain groups, so it is easy to get the impression that paganism was constantly under threat. This is however the impression Christian emperors and writers wanted to give to the reader - they desired a Christian empire, so they legislated against certain practices and denigrated the popularity of paganism. In reality, pagan elites continued to thrive throughout the fourth century, so much so that we can't even really say that there was a 'pagan' party fighting a losing battle against a Christian tide, as pagan and Christian officials worked together to deal with the empire's problems. Even when they treated each other as enemies, we have to look for personal and political reasons for conflicts as well, rather than just to focus on their religion. As for the destruction of temples that we know about, such as the famous Serapeum (which did not contain a library by the way...), they were seemingly the result of riots initiated by Christian mobs, rather than by imperial edicts. I guess what I'm trying to say here is that we should be aware that 'pagan' and 'Christian' were not definitive categories for people in late antiquity. Many people were devoted to their beliefs, but many others found it easy to cross these boundaries, whether out of genuine faith, their cultural context or for more cynical reasons. People also identified themselves by their ethnicity, their social position and their relation to others, so to get a sense of how they converted (or not), we have to look at the bigger picture, which actually makes everything a lot more complicated. This answer got a bit too vague towards the end, so feel free to ask me more specific questions about religion in the Roman Empire :)", "label": 0}, {"content": "Christianity was a new religion that was able to overcome paganism because it was a new religion that was able to offer a better life.

In the 1980s General Secretary Gorbachev received a monthly salary of around 1,500 rubles (the equivalent of around $2,500 using official exchange rates), while other Politburo members received around 1,000-1,200. The top generals and minister of defense received around 2,000 rubles, various entertainers and cultural important persons in the Soviet Union received around 1,000 per month. By comparison, a general medical practitioner on the average received around 130 Ruble a month, which was less than that of a bus driver.In some ways the question itself is somewhat problematic, because in the Soviet Union the monetary system isn't as meaningful as in a capitalist country. Often times it's not enough for one to have the monetary means to acquire desired goods, but you would also need *blat*, or connections with the right people to sell it to you. This often involved \"trading\" favors in which both parties would be conducting illicit transactions to procure the goods/services they desire from each other. This could be qualified as \"corruption\" but it was also a widely engaged practice in the Soviet Union and an inbuilt part of the system.Wealth also existed in the form of perks. For instance, being a ranking official in the party meant you received a state owned Dacha and a large apartment which cannot be bought. You would be assigned a car and driver paid for by the state. Your children would be able to go to the best schools and you would be admitted to the best hospitals. You would be given access to special shops selling rare goods at special prices. You would have access to spas, resorts, entertainment, foreign and domestic travel off limits to the average person: often at government expense.Also as before mentioned, being an apparatchik give you more power, connections and therefore means to trade favors with others to acquire goods and services that one desires.

In sheer duration, the series of conflicts lasted for an entire generation. While it is true that the conflict was intermittent and officially only a series of wars, the singular character of its focus, France and Napoleon, gave it a historic grounding that drastically effected the lives of famous artists ranging from Goya, Beethoven, Haydn, Hegel, and Tolstoy, all of whose artwork and literature was drastically effected by the conflict. **Major political results occurred** despite the hard fought efforts of conservative Europe to bottle back up liberalism and French nationalism. Latin America gained near total independence in the aftermath of Spain's occupation and economic destruction by the French. French Haiti erupted in racial and class warfare as a result of the revolution, and Napoleon's failure to reconquer the island directly led to his decision to handle the Louisiana Purchase with America. The US itself fought a major war with England, and America, Spain, and Russia all saw their capitals burned to the ground. Germany changed too. The literary birth of German nationalism amongst the bourgeois might be traced to the conflict and the writings of Fichte and his kind, while politically the conflict saw Prussia recover from its lethargy after the Seven Years War and end up at Waterloo as a premier German military power with the cadre structure needed to eventually defeat Austria.  **The world was astounded by this war.** I feel it important to note that it was also referred to by contemporaries such as Pitt and Jefferson as a Great War, that it was perceived by Russians and likely a dozen other agrarian societies ranging from Spain to Egypt as the war against the Antichrist or Devil. Contemporaries viewed it as one vast conflict begun when France overthrew its legitimate government perhaps (this could messily be considered the Tory view), or when France fell into the hands of a tyrant (the Whig view). **The human cost from 1792-1814 lay in the millions**.

On the other hand, the origin of the saying seems pretty clear. (Be warned: this post starts off pretty lighthearted, but swerves suddenly into discussing systemic child abuse. I apologise for this \u2013 the question shall receive its answer.)We know that full Spartan citizens were required to spend all their evenings in the company of the other men of their *syssitia* (variably named in Greek and variously translated \u201cmess group\u201d, \u201ctent group\u201d or similar). These groups formed the units around which Spartan life was organised. They are a formalised version of the *hetaireia* (companionships) that were an element of leisure-class life throughout the Greek world: closed circles of wealthy men who gathered for *symposia* (drinking parties) in which food, drink, poetry, dance and debate were shared. Where other Greek societies accepted the existence of *hetaireia* as a way for the elite to cement social networks and exchange (often anti-democratic) ideas, the Spartans positively mandated that every citizen had to be part of a *syssitia* and had to partake in meals, songs, traditions, exercise and war together with the same small group of associates. This was a way to enforce conformity to the values of Spartan society, to regulate the way Spartiates used their free time, and to ensure that the experience of citizenship was outwardly the same for all Spartiates.The result of the legal requirement to dine with the tent group was that every Spartiate spent every night at a drinking party. The *symposion* was stereotypically a  bawdy affair; it was common to engage in rounds of \u201cbottoms up\u201d drinking to the health of the host, the gods, the musicians and dancers and rhapsodes offering entertainment, or whoever else came to mind. We know of Classical Greek drinking songs and drinking games. We have vase paintings of men [throwing up](_URL_0_) (link NSFW) because they've had too much; such pictures were sometimes humourously painted at the bottom of a wine cup, so that they would appear as the drinker got literally and figuratively \u201cin their cups\u201d. In short, if the dinners of Spartan tent groups were too much like drinking parties of *hetaireia* elsewhere, the famed Spartiates might have spent most of their time either plastered or nursing a hangover.The Spartans, therefore, decided it would be wise to temper the excesses of their drinking parties. They allegedly taught their children about the dangers of drunkenness by getting their helots trashed and forcing them to perform humiliating dances. They rationed the amount of wine allowed per man on campaign, and at home they banned the practice of drinking rounds to people's health. However, they also put in place a very simple rule: they forbade citizens of military age (20-60) from carrying lamps or torches when they made their way home from their messes. Those who were too wasted would inevitably get lost or fall into a ditch somewhere, to the general merriment of the other members of their tent group. To avoid the humiliation, it was hoped, Spartiates would keep careful track of their consumption to make sure they could still find their way home (Xenophon, *Constitution of the Lakedaimonians* 5.7).From this anecdote, we learn one thing about bedtime for Spartiates: it was already dark when they went home. It seems likely that the saying you're citing is derived from this simple observation. That said, the time indicated is pretty lenient. At the latitude of the Mediterranean, dusk occurs well before 10pm at all times of the year, so Spartiates wouldn't have had to stay out that late in order to have to make their way back in the dark. The latest sunset, at around the summer solstice, is at 9pm.The more interesting question is why there would be an early twentieth-century German saying of this kind, referring to the lifestyle of Spartiates. Presumably the ways of the Spartans as recorded by Xenophon in the 4th century BC would not exactly have been common knowledge among the German population. But, as the fascinating research of Helen Roche has shown, there was one group of Germans who were obsessed with the Spartan Way, emulated the perceived Spartan ethic in every way, and self-identified proudly as \u201cSpartan youths\u201d (Spartanerjunge): the young cadets of the Prussian officer schools.^1These schools, scattered about the country that formerly made up the Prussian kingdom, offered an absolutely ruthless education, intending to create tough and unflinching officers by inflicting upon its cadets a regime of exposure, deprivation, undernourishment, brutal corporal punishment, and systemic hazing and bullying. Roche cites a former cadet visiting a famously harsh British boarding school and remarking that the softness of British officers was not surprising given how comfortable their upbringing was. The children sent into the Prussian cadet schools were accustomed to humiliation and suffering to the point where they made their stoic endurance of such horrors into a point of pride; it was common for cadets to inflict pain *upon themselves* just to show how much they could take. The identity these cadets adopted in order to endure constant deprivation and abuse was that of \u201cSpartan youths\u201d \u2013 since the Spartans, according to late sources like Plutarch, subjected their children to a similar education in order to harden them into the finest warriors of the ancient world. In this way the cadets could persuade themselves that what they suffered was for the greater good; it would make them into the sort of men who would fight to the death at Thermopylai.While the adoption of this identity was of course encouraged by the teachers at the Prussian cadet schools, there doesn't seem to have been any official impulse to spread this notion among the cadets. In other words, the idea of adopting \u201cSpartan\u201d ethics must have arisen among the cadets themselves, gradually spreading into the culture of Prussian officers as former cadets grew up and took office in the armed forces. This means that the view of Sparta held by these would-be Spartan youths is based on what few sources and secondary works they could have had access to. It's clear that the notion of Spartan-ness held by the cadets is pretty narrow: it's based pretty much exclusively around Plutarch's description of the late, re-reformed *agoge* and around the legend of Thermopylai. It ignores much else that is known about Spartan society. Roche notes that the young cadets seem to have gotten their understanding of Sparta mainly from Plutarch's *Life of Lykourgos*, and little else. But it so happens that this source repeats the anecdote found in Xenophon: >  After drinking moderately, they go off home without a torch; for they are not allowed to walk with a light, either on this or any other occasion, that they may accustom themselves to marching boldly and without fear in the darkness of night. -- Plutarch, *Life of Lykourgos* 12.7Now, I obviously don't actually know the context of the saying, or who would have used it, or when. But based on the simple information that it may have been a local German saying from the beginning of the twentieth century, it may well be that this was an aspect of the common culture of the Prussian cadets, who sought to emulate in every way the Spartans they so admired.1) Roche, H. *Sparta's German Children: the ideal of ancient Sparta in the Royal Prussian Cadet-Corps, 1818-1920, and in National Socialist elite schools (the Napolas), 1933-1945* (2013)", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Spartans were a warrior society who lived in a very different time to our own.

In the early modern period it became common for aristocrats to pay a 'vail' when staying as a guest with other aristocrats. This was used to reward servants of that house who put in extra effort and carried out extra duties on behalf of the guests. This spread from there into commercial establishments when coffee shops and restaurants began to expand in the cities. By the 1760s, footmen, valets and other staff would expect vails, and there are references in a number of contemporary sources to tipping in coffee houses.Prior to the Civil War, Americans did not tip. Much like in modern Japan, it was seen as unseemly to do so, undemocratically highlighting the social power between tipper and tippee. This changed in the late 19th century when Americans started visiting Europe. They picked up the practice and quickly became renowned for over-tipping - partly seen as a consequence of them not being used to having staff in the way that wealthy Europeans were.When Americans returned home, the practice spread, though it was not without critics. Anti-Tipping leagues were formed, and the practice was banned in 6 states between 1909 and 1926. In the 1960s tipping became even more common and arguable mandatory when Congress altered the law to allow minimum wage to be discounted for tips. This forced many waitstaff to live off tips, and therefore they became a greater expectation. The growth of people having a waiting job at some point in their lives also encouraged the growth of tipping culture.If you want to know more, the best book on the subject is probably [*Tipping: An American Social History of Gratuities* by Kerry Segrave](_URL_0_) though it is more of an archive than analysis.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The \"tipping culture\" in the US originated in the late 19th century, when the first restaurants opened in the United States.

Truman had no personal fortune, and when he finished his term, he refused to accept any paying positions in the private sector, because he believed that to do so would be to cheapen the office of the Presidency. Unfortunately, this meant that he was left living on the $105/month pension that he earned from his service in the military. This was deeply troubling to many of the Congressmen, Senators, and even President Eisenhower himself, so in the 1950s, a law was passed guaranteeing the former President and his widow a pension, staff support, travel funds, and mailing privileges.

The perceived failure of the UNOSOM missions and the graphic destruction of US military forces (broadcast 24 hours/day by CNN, who learned much about American media appetites in the first Gulf War) by what amounted to a well-armed mob, was a black eye for humanitarian actions in the region.  Walter Clark, the (I believe) deputy special envoy to Somalia, was quoted as saying \"The ghosts of Somalia continue to haunt US policy. Our lack of response in\u00a0Rwanda was a fear of getting involved in something like a Somalia all over again.\"\u00a0 The immediate post Cold War period in American foreign policy saw us involved in a number of humanitarian interventions, several of which were perceived as spectacular failures; the inability of UN peacekeeping forces (often with heavy US involvement) to deter high-profile horrors like the Srebernica massacre (former Yugoslavia) brought fashionable ideas like the responsibility to protect into question.  The truth was that most of those operations were actually getting the job done - the huge contingent of US Marines supporting the UNISOM mission in Somalia was quite effective in restoring order, for instance, and Bosnia and Serbia were effectively sorted out (Richard Holbrooke wrote a great book detailing that peace process). The optics were a problem, though. Oddly, in some ways the US fell victim to its own success; our sweeping coalition victory in Iraq in 1991 set an unreasonable expectation for the effectiveness of military force as a means for intervention, created undue faith in multilateral coalition building, and also empowered those who supported military intervention in non-warfighting roles. While that method of deployment wasn't exactly new, it was used in the post Cold War world with a newfound vigor and frequency, the possible side effects of a military that quite suddenly found itself without a pole star (no more Soviets, no more mission).Memories of Vietnam, contrasted with the incredible success of Gulf War I left the American public and politicians with a distaste for quagmires.  American involvement in Somalia was too short and ineffective; once the Marines bugged out, the UN peacekeeping forces lost their teeth and the region began to destabilize.

The only way that even makes minimal sense as a southern grievance is if southern state governments and a large portion of the white populace in the slave states wanted Lincoln on the ballot. They didn't and *that was the whole point.* The simple threat of an antislavery president was enough to trigger an existential crisis for the section. One actually winning pushed the most enslaving states over the edge because they believed he was coming for their human property, whether directly or indirectly. That's the cause of the Civil War and everything else that gets tossed up either as secondary causes or as a distraction, to the degree they have any historical basis at all, flows from it.But you asked about the why and that requires going into how elections worked at the time. Today, we go into the booth and there's a ballot paper printed by the state with all the candidates on it that qualify under whatever eligibility requirements the state has. You go into a little booth or otherwise secure your privacy, mark your ballot however your precinct does that, hand it in and go home.This is not how the middle nineteenth century runs elections at all. Ballots are produced by partisan printers. They will have the full ticket filled in correctly: just the names of the people the printer endorses for each spot. If you want to change that, you've got to scratch out their name and write in the one you prefer. Then you have to actually cast the ballot, which is done in public. Printers usually run off ballots on different colors of paper and/or different sizes too, so everybody around can see who you vote for.Voting for an \"abolitionist\" (which Lincoln is not, but white Southerners rarely care for fine distinctions in these things) is a good way to get yourself mobbed in much of the South. Election violence isn't exactly common (though it is more so the further west one goes) but it's regular enough that everyone knows the score. Furthermore, freelance violence against people not deemed sufficiently proslavery is a regular part of southern political life. Simply debating the merits of slavery can risk violence, let alone voting for an antislavery ticket. Even in Kentucky, which is more permissive than most of the South, antislavery speakers can literally get stabbed for the deed.But that assumes you can get your hands on a GOP ballot, if you even want to. (Most of the white South has been all-in on slavery for decades by the time 1860 rolls around.) Most printers are local, so they're part of and subject to the same community pressures as ordinary voters. Given the expense of a steam press and the ease with which a mob can wreck one, as well as their requirement for the goodwill of the community for their business to continue, they're probably more vulnerable than usual.It's true that Lincoln isn't on ballots in the South for all those reasons...except that he is in a few slave states. (He loses them.) The thing is that his not being an option for voters is what the South intends from the start. They're not upset that they couldn't vote for him, but rather angry that their proscriptions didn't settle the election in their favor. That suggests to the white South that their regime is unstable to a new degree, particularly as the GOP is keen to expand its reach in the Border South. There are small Republican parties operating in Maryland and Missouri already. What happens if Lincoln uses the spoils system, as every president did, to seed the rest of the section with antislavery men? They would be the nucleus of new state GOPs that might build the infrastructure that makes slavery debates unavoidable. The two-party system was only tolerable in the slave states so long as both parties competed over who was the most proslavery, which the GOP will not do. Breaking the appearance of white uniformity can underscore its genuine absence (though the GOP was always too optimistic about having hordes of antislavery whites who just needed a vehicle) and will, in the minds of enslavers, embolden the people they enslave. That will, again their estimation, inevitably bring bloody slave revolts which can easily snowball into a genocidal race war. White southerners expect to win that one, because they're white supremacists, but they know it'll be bloody and probably cost them a lot of lives on top of the tremendous profits at stake.**Sources***Liberty  &  Slavery* by William Cooper*Road to Disunion* (2 vols) by William Freehling*The Fiery Trial* by Eric Foner", "label": 0}, {"content": "The newly formed Republican Party was split into two factions, the Northern faction and the Southern faction.

I use the term people of the Persian Empire because under this empire were many semi-autonomous regions that paid tribute to the Great King and each had their own culture and ways. In effect his actions were attempts to pacify the local populations. And below I will use some examples to show this. Firstly, the precedent behind this idea of pacification came from Alexander's Father,  Philip II. At the time of his accession Macedon had just suffered a catastrophic defeat to the tribes of 'barbarians' around Macedon and truly threatened the country. Over his early kingship Philip defeated each tribe one one by one and married a leading noble woman from each one. Olympias, Alexander's mother  was from Eprius. This lead to Attalus a Macedonian noble and the father in law of Philip's last wife (they were polyamorous marriages) claiming:*'May you have many true Macedonian Heirs* This led Alexander to throw a cup at Attalus and have a sword drawn on him by Philip. The 2004 film actually rips this encounter pretty much word from word from Plutarch's life of Alexander. Which I think is nice. Anyway in relation to the question, what this shows is that Alexander was accustomed to seeing his father take steps to align somewhat to the people he had conquered to keep them in line. And thus it was only natural for him to carry on that path, although Alexander was not against the use of force (see the sacking of thebes) This background let's look at three examples of how Alexander kept in tradition with his father. 1. Egypt. Alexander and then the Pltomies after him were exception at getting the Egyptians on side. The perisans had been disrespectful to the Egpytian religion and had slaughter the Apis Bull, one of the most revered animals in Egypt. Alexander did none of that. He willingly accepted the title of Pharoh of the Egyptians and after his trip to Siwah always referred to himself as the son of Zeus Ammon, an almacation of Zeus and Ammon the two heads of their respected pantheons.2. Coinage. I have been studying Macedonian coinage of Alexander of Alexander a lot recently, coming to one conclusion that suggests that Babylon became the major mint for the output of Tetradrachms for Alexander's soldiers returning from India. Anyway. What did happen there was the continuation of the minting of the Daric coins. These coins were extremely Persian with symbols such as kneeling archers visible. What this suggests is that there were two economies or at least or that was spilt down two lines,  one of the soliders and conquerors and  one that was there before the Macedonian arrival that  was civilian that Alexander knew would be too hard to overall and remove in one go. 3. Our final example although there are many more is the treatment of Bessus. Bessus was a commander under Darius III and during the final retreat of Darius after Gaugamela killed the Persian King. A theme common through the ancient world (See Pompey and Mithrodates, Caesar and Pompey) He sprung up resistance and Alexander moved to capture him. Upon capture Alexander had him treated as a Persian would by cutting off his nose and earlobes. This sent a message to any Persians looking to claim the throne that Alexander was willing to be brutal when needed and shocked the Macedonians, bit also pleased then to see him be tough on anyone with traitorous thoughts, albeit only when they foreign. What these examples how then is the way that Alexander emulated his father in attempts to keep control over a much larger area of land with diverse people's. To answer then the question in a concluding sentence he appeared Persian as he appeared Egyptian, as he appeared Greek to keep control and appeal to the people of his empire.

It had its strongest supporters in Germany, and many of those supporters migrated to the United States in the 1840s and 1850s, part of a flood of immigration about the time of the failed 1848 general European revolution.Because conservative factions won that revolution almost universally across Europe, it was the liberals who emigrated to the United States, carrying their ideas with them. They believed in things like kindergarten (a German word, mind you), universal education, the elimination of slavery, and other radical concepts along those lines. German and Austrian immigrants made up an even larger portion of the Union armies in the Civil War than did the famed Irish regiments.With conservative Democrats out of Congress because of the war, a liberal Republican-led Congress in 1862 passed the Land-Grant College Act of 1862, which provided grants of land to states across the United States to finance universities specializing in \"agriculture and the mechanic arts.\"This was a huge innovation, and it's a key sign that higher education was seen as politically liberal even in 1862. Indeed, President Lincoln was already leaning upon the politically liberal ideas of college professors when he approved guidelines for the treatment of prisoners of war and general rules of war to be followed by the Union armies in combat.The Land-Grant College Act was a key milestone in the advancement of higher education in the United States, because it democratized it, allowing it to be accessible to many more Americans than before. Until 1862, colleges tended to cater toward the elite. Institutions like Yale and Harvard, among the oldest in the United States, produced theologians and lawyers, people among the upper strata of society. They were exactly the people most inclined to want to keep society the way it was, because they had the most to lose if it changed.The establishment of West Point was a step toward the democratization of higher education in the United States, because it didn't distinguish based on the ability to pay for the education. Furthermore, it taught engineering, which at the time was considered a \"lesser\" study than the law. West Point (and Annapolis, later) still had a high bar for entry, but it was a *political* bar rather than a financial bar. One had to be recommended to the institution, and while that was easier, it wasn't *easy.*Once the Land-Grant College Act arrived, there were a wave of institutions to choose from, and competition begat lower prices in a classic case of supply and demand. Once World War II arrived, the Montgomery GI Bill ensured that anyone (Note: blacks were excluded) could attend these colleges, which by 1944 had 80 years to become established. That was the last step needed for the democratization of higher education.Now, it should be noted that **the whole idea of public education, enshrined in the United States from its earliest days** (I'm thinking in particular of the Land Ordinance of 1785) **is at its heart a liberal idea.** The notion of giving a schoolroom education to everyone was a departure from the previous process of education through apprenticeships and journeymen in a trade. Previously, in Western Europe, general education was usually restricted to the elite, or religious institutions. Overton Taylor's \"Liberal Education and Liberalism,\" published in the Jan. 1945 issue of *Ethics*, is a good walkthrough of how the idea of widespread *lower* education was also a liberal idea, but that's outside the scope of your question.

[The U.S. even let China go communist](_URL_5_) without much of a fight in the late 40s, despite nominally being allied with Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist party.The Cold War was fought over issues of power and hegemony.  What changed wasn't that communism was all-of-a-sudden more threatening after WWII.  In fact, Stalin took significant actions that made Soviet communism less threatening to external powers (and his WWII alliance partners), for example:* His \"[Socialism in One Country](_URL_4_)\" doctrine that renounced global revolution;* Having Trotsky, the main proponent of permanent revolution, assassinated in 1940; and,* Disbanding Comintern in 1943 and replacing it later with Comecon.The Cold War occurred not because of ideological conflict (although ideological differences exacerbated differences and communication problems between the two superpowers), but because of the destruction of the balance of power in Europe after the defeat of Nazi Germany, the inability of the British Empire to maintain its great power status, and the ruin of the rest of continental Europe, including former-great power France.While Stalin was probably a paranoiac, the Soviet Union has legitimate security concerns following WWII.  It had been invaded by Germany twice in 30 years, had lost 20-30 million men in the war, its economy was barely industrialized and was still mostly comprised of agriculture and peasants, and even though the United States had supplied the USSR with the majority of its materiel to keep it in the war effort, the the US  &  UK waited three long years to create a Western front.  The USSR was not interested in leaving itself open to yet another attack from Europe.Stalin pursued a sphere of influence policy, a very traditional foreign policy from the balance of power era, creating a buffer zone out of Eastern Europe.  Germany \u2013 the country that had just invaded Russia twice \u2013 was kept divided and subordinated.  Poland \u2013 traditionally hostile to Russia \u2013 was also kept subordinated.  The best way to ensure that these countries were not going to be hostile was to convert them into ideologically and structurally similar regime types, led by clients whose power and position would be dependent on Moscow.While Churchill was more understanding of spheres of influence balance of power politics, the United States was not.  To the United States it didn't matter much if Eastern Europe were dominated by German totalitarianism or Soviet totalitarianism \u2013 each was an unacceptable result of WWII.  The Red Army remained throughout Eastern Europe, and the USSR was the most formidable land power in the world, with an army unmatched in size.  The industrial core of continental Europe \u2013 West Germany, France, Northern Italy, the low countries \u2013 were a stone's throw away from the massive Red Army.  Theoretically, the Red Army could sweep into Western Europe before the United States (much less Britain) could mount any response at all.The doctrine of containment was formulated by a State Department official, and former U.S. ambassador to the USSR, George Kennan.  Kennan was a \"realist,\" which in international relations theory means (nb: oversimplifying greatly here) that he was more concerned about the balance of power than ideological differences.  He wrote \"[The Long Telegram](_URL_3_)\" and the [\"X\" article](_URL_0_) explaining why the Soviet Union posed a threat and why containment ought to be the strategy for mitigating that threat.  Containment was less about communism than it was about preventing the imposition of Soviet-friendly regimes around the world through revolution or Soviet imperialism.  (It should be noted here that Kennan was far less cavalier about intervention around the world, and mostly was interested in protecting key industrialized regions, whereas Paul Nitze (principal author of [NSC-68](_URL_2_)) was far more convinced that Soviet expansion had to be countered everywhere it cropped up.)The proxy wars were fought to prevent the USSR or the U.S. from gaining an advantage in the balance of power.

Tito's Yugoslavia remained independent of Soviet influence (even defiant of it).  Likewise, following the [Sino-Soviet split](_URL_1_), the United States and People's Republic of China informally allied against Soviet \"hegemonism.\"  The key example of this is the collaborative effort between the U.S. and China (with help from Pakistan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the UK) to aid Afghans in expelling Soviet troops from 1979 through 1989.Insofar as communism was an indicator of alignment with the USSR, the U.S. was willing to fight its spread.

Thus, for a variety of reasons, people have often felt more comfortable denouncing the claims as propaganda. But archaeology is here to afflict the comfortable. Excavations at the major Carthaginian tophet--a sacred cemetery and ritual site--revealed an entire section dedicated to infant burials. But not just any infants: recent researchers have concluded that the vast majority of infants were healthy and around two months old when they died. For illness, accident, and stillbirth reasons, generalized high levels of infant mortality would be more likely to produce a higher proportion of infants who had died at a younger age (later premodern statistics back this up). Additionally, chronologically the burials themselves are clustered around a distinct moments in time rather than consistently spaced out. This suggests: (1) yes, the infants were probably sacrificed and buried at the sacred site, and (2) it wasn't necessarily a standard or regularly scheduled practice, but a last-ditch, utterly desperate attempt to make things right with the gods in times of calamity and cataclysm.And you might also be interested in the thread in this post, starring /u/QuickSpore:* [What was the religion of ancient Carthage?](_URL_1_)", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Carthaginians were a fiercely independent people, and were not a part of the Roman Empire.

That said, this was a controversial inclusion into the Constitution at the time. There was a deep disagreement among the Founding Fathers on whether the power should be unlimited. At the Constitutional Convention of 1787 there was a proposal made by Roger Sherman to require Senate affirmation of a Presidential Pardon. It was defeated 8-1, but it became a hotbed issue as the document made its way to the States to be ratified individually. The anti-Federalists were adamantly opposed to the unlimited Pardon power. Their arguments rested primarily on the idea that an unlimited pardon could and would lead back to tyranny. Edmund Randolph also believed that an unlimited pardon, specifically a power that could pardon treason, would lead to tyranny. After it became clear that the pardon power was mostly supported and would be included in the final draft, without a Senate consent clause, the conversation shifted to whether there should be exceptions made for treason and/or impeachment. However, \"treason\" was a funny word to the delegates. England has had a long history of using \"treason\" as an all-encompassing concept, a sort of umbrella law where if someone the government didn't like hadn't broken other laws they could still be brought up on charges of treason. We know from Madison's notes that there was much discussion about whether the President's pardon power should include matters of treason. One suggestion was to reserve pardons for treason to the Senate, but this was shot down by Rufus King of MA and George Mason of VA who claimed respectively that the Senate was too politicized and already had too much power in the Constitution. The debate among the state legislators was far more intense. Hamilton wrote in Federalist 74 that \"one man appears to be a more eligble dispenser of the mercy of government, than a body of men\". This became the core argument of the Federalists in support of the pardon. The arguments against the pardon were from the Anti-Federalists. Specifically number 67, in which George Clinton argued the proposed Constitution provided the President with a power that would \"tend either to the establishment of a vile and arbitrary aristocracy or monarchy\". Clinton also wrote: > ...His power of nomination and influence on all appointments; the strong posts in each state comprised within his superintendence, and garrisoned by troops under his direction; his control over the army, militia, and navy; the unrestrained power of granting pardons for treason which may be used to screen from punishment those whom he had secretly instigated to commit the crime, and thereby prevent a discovery of his own guilt; his duration in office for four years-these, and various other principles evidently prove the truth of the position, that if the president is possessed of ambition, he has power and time sufficient to ruin his country.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The power to pardon was given to the president by the Constitution.

The image is by famed Victorian-era illustrator [George Cruikshank](_URL_0_) (1792-1878) and dates to 1864. It features old women. Like many old people who find their facial fats and their teeth depleted, their noses appear to grow in size. Asserting that this was part of some anti-Semitic conspiracy is absurd unless someone can provide the smoking gun that demonstrates that people purposefully decided to depict witches in a way that would increase anti-Semitic sentiment. And I am fairly certain that no one will find that documentation. Witches were often popularly perceived to be old, and old people have noses that seem to grow with age. This has nothing to do with anti-Jewish propaganda.Four decades ago I heard a lecture by a historian of Africa who asserted that the French used their cannon to blow off the nose of the Sphinx because the nose had the appearance of someone from below the Sahara, and the Napoleonic troops wanted to cover up the \"fact\" that Egyptian culture was actually Sub-Saharan. All well and good except that no one knows what the nose of the Sphinx looked like AND there is no real evidence that the story of French troops practicing with their cannon on the Sphinx is true. Asserting these sorts of things to support a political agenda, to support an assertion that this or that is part of a larger conspiracy of prejudice is a disservice to reality. And it is particularly offensive since there is clear evidence of widespread anti-Semitism just as there is a widespread tendency to ignore the achievements of sub-Saharan Africa. We don't need to make up things to reinforce what is true, and when we do invent these sorts of things, it weakens the stand that many would take against anti-Semitism or anything else of its sort.

In 1899 the only predictable link between Tahiti and the US is the Union line running San Francisco-Papeete-Auckland.  So as long as you could get yourself to San Francisco getting passage to Tahiti would be pretty straight forward-- alternatively you could possibly find a cargo ship under contract to carry lumber or something from San Francisco to Tahiti and get a berth on it.  Or if it is late summer, its possible there might be a few captains preparing to head down to the Tuamotu archipelago (right next to the Society Islands/Tahiti) for the pearlshell fishing season and who could be persuaded to take you down.  If you are really wealthy, you could charter a smaller ship and crew for yourself and take it over.  Otherwise, the Union line is the most predictable and obvious choice.Buying land is going to be more difficult, in 1899 most land has never been officially registered under the French Civil Code and remained in the hands of Tahitians.  The French had, since 1866 during the years of the French Protectorate, been attempting, somewhat halfheartedly to institute a European style private property regime.  Attempts had largely failed with the exception of land in the port city of Papeete and then a few large plantations like Atimaono or Opunohu over on Mo'orea.  Tahitian land tenure was nothing like that of France in the 19th century; land was not owned by individuals, but rather individuals, families, or clans maintained various rights of access or denial over resources.  For example, and one that I am simplifying quite a bit, a high ranking ari'i might always have access to a particular grove of 'uru (breadfruit) because of his rank and position, but this would not be the case for everyone else in his family or his clan.  He would have the right to restrict access through a rahui, a prohibition on a place, resource, activity for a set amount of time.  Likely he would not be the only one with this power and there may be trees within the grove which were exceptions to his authority.  Indeed, while he might govern access to the grove, he might not have the right to take 'uru from it, that could be the sole right of a different family, or clan, or individuals of a certain rank.  So for the French, the question was who owns the land?  They tended to view this through the lens of French feudalism and translate the ari\u2019i as lord who could dispose of property as he saw fit.  Yet, republican French sentiments also recognized that this was far from the case on the ground and sometimes construed land tenure as communal in nature, which meant the community/family had to agree to invest ownership in individuals (or establish fractional ownership which was either seen as not ideal because the land was more difficult to sell; or seen as ideal because it meant the land was more difficult to sell and therefor could not be entirely alienated to Europeans\u2014 two sides of the same coin essentially). What often happened is that attempts to transform indigenous land rights into French private property involved lengthy land court cases.  The only way to for sure buy the land was to buy out anyone who had a claim to the land so they would not object in court.The French Government recommended to emigrants that they not try to buy land as the plots were too small and instead lease land.  Land leases held up better in courts as the question of rents could be argued between all those who held a valid claim on the land, while you, the renter could go about your business.  In 1899, you arriving in the midst of a big push by the government to register land and conduct land surveys, ultimately they won't make a whole lot of progress outside of Papeete, but at least in town there should be plots of land available.As to staying as a permanent resident.  You would definitely need to meet with the French governor, present your funds/resources (justify being allowed to reside and conduct business in the colony).  You might want to make friends with some high powered lawyers like Auguste Goupil who can help you get access to land and laborers if you need.  If you want to become French, that is also an option, though I am not entirely sure of citizenship requirements in 1899.  I believe there is an American consul in 1899, Julius Dreher, who could also help you with questions of residency or contact back to people within the United States.*edit : cheers for the gold!

I've never had a whole lot of success posting on this sub, which makes me love it even more.Okay, so I guess I need to explain how I know about this... My dad was an infantry officer in the US Army between 1974 and 2006. He enlisted, hit sergeant, went to college, became and officer and retired as a Major. This obviously led me to at least a passing interest in military history and I took courses throughout college. I have \"some\" government experience that involves warfare but I have never personally served in the military, i.e. I've never had a rank. Swore an oath though.So to answer the question...The answer is that it's not really considered a practical text on military leadership and strategy. The book was written in 500 BC so it's not necessarily as practical. Is the book on the recommended reading list for West Point? Yes it is. [_URL_0_](_URL_0_) But it is more considered a part of the history of warfare rather than a guide to how to execute modern warfare.I mention the present to show how the book was received in the first Western-language version, which was in French, I want to say in the late 1770s. So, guns were already a thing in combat. The first English translations didn't hit until the 20th century.To see what I mean about the practicality of Sun Tzu's advice, much of which is pretty standard for officer training, just look to the \"9 Terrains\" chapter. It's interesting but limited to a man who had only seen Asia, as vast and diverse as that terrain is, at a specific time. By the time English translations were becoming available, a new generation of officers was wondering how airplanes would affect combat. Sun Tzu never thought of that.Maybe this is a little too far down but the introduction to the history behind \"The Art of War\" written by Victor Mair (had to delete a link here, I didn't realize that apparently it was a pirated version, my apologies) notes that information spread at the time meant that Sun Tzu was not widely known among Western audiences until much, much later than we realize. For example, the Japanese translation wasn't done until 1750!Mair also notes that it was a Jesuit priest that published the first French version in 1772. He goes on to further note that the modern popularity of Sun Tzu seems to be linked to a rumor in the 20th century that Napoleon had read the French translation and used it to help conquer Europe. No evidence Napoleon read the Art of War has ever been presented as far as I know and Mair straight up debunks this while probably giving the most direct answer to the original question:\"...although there was some notice of Amiot's translation in French literary journals when it was first published in 1772, the book soon dropped out of sigh so far as the general public was concerned...\"Basically, the only people that cared at the time were people already interested in China.Did I do it right?

His style was also distinct enough to be parodied as evident by Aladdin.

Horses, however, have some ability not only to recognize that there is grass under the snow but also to use their hard hooves to break through ice.  > Horses are easier to feed through the winter than cattle or sheep, as cattle and sheep push snow aside with their noses and horses use their hard hooves. Sheep can graze on winter grass through soft snow, but if the snow becomes crusted with ice than their noses will get raw and bloody, and they will stand and starve in a field where there is ample winter forage just beneath their feet. Cattle do not forage through even soft snow if they cannot see the grass, so a snow deep enough to hide the winter grass will kill range cattle if they are not given fodder. Neither cattle nor sheep will break the ice on frozen water to drink. Horses have the instinct to break through ice and crusted snow with their hooves, not their noses, even in deep snows where the grass cannot be seen. They paw frozen snow away and feed themselves and so do not need water or fodder. In 1245 the Franciscan John of Plano Carpini journeyed to Mongolia to meet G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan (the successor to Genghis) and observed the steppe horses of the Tartars, as he called them, digging for grass from under the snow, \u201csince the Tartars have neither straw nor hay nor fodder.\u201d During the historic blizzard of 1886 in the North American Plains hundreds of thousands of cattle were lost on the open range. Those that survived followed herds of mustangs and grazed in the areas they opened up.^7 Horses are supremely well adapted to the cold grasslands where they evolved. People who lived in cold grasslands with domesticated cattle and sheep would soon have seen the advantage in keeping horses for meat, just because the horses did not need fodder or water. A shift to colder climatic conditions or even a particularly cold series of winters could have made cattle herders think seriously about domesticating horses. Just such a shift to colder winters occurred between about 4200 and 3800 BCE (see chapter 11).Therefore, there wouldn\u2019t be a need for the Dakota (or any other nomadic horse people, from the proto-Indo-Europeans to the Mongols) to specifically store hay for winter. It allows nomadic horse pasturage in areas where cattle-herding and shepherding simply isn\u2019t possible.

The only way that we are going to have any knowledge of what the first civilizations knew of their past is through written records. Writing first appears in Sumer in around 3000 BC, this is during the Uruk period (4000-3001 BC). At this time it was very much proto-writing and did not develop into a full written language until the Early Dynastic Period (2800-2500 BC)It is not until the end of the Early Dynastic Period (2300 BC) that we see the emergence of the Sumerian King List which documents the kings of Sumer and gives us an insight into what the Sumerians may have believed about their past.The King List, a collection of several sources, details the rulers of the cities of Sumer from the first antediluvian rulers to the last dynasty of Isin. The first king was Alulim, first king of Eridu. He ruled for 28,800 years. Now at first glance that may seem an unreasonably long rule and that is because it is. Alulim, the first king after the kingship descended from heaven created by the god Enki is clearly almost entirely mythical. This list of antediluvian kings ends with Ubara-tutu and the coming of the great flood that wipes the world clean.The list resumes with Jushur the first of the dynasty of Kish. He ruled for 1200 years. 20 kings and 15255 years later we have En-me-barage-si who is the first king we have archaeological evidence for. He is dated from around 2600 BC from two pieces of alabaster vases found at Nippur which bear his name. Though he ruled for 900 years, a rather long time, it can be surmised that he is indeed real. He is mentioned also in the Epic of Gilgamesh alongside Gilgamesh himself giving credence to the thought that Gilgamesh is a historical figure. The King List continues into the time of rulers that can easily be verified such as Sargon of Akkad who ruled for 40 years and founded the Akkadian Empire. Thus we see the transition of the mythical into the semi-mythical and then verifiable history. But more on that later.The Sumerian creation myth is important to note in this discussion. It recounts that the gods Enki among them created the first \u201cblack-headed people\u201d (the Sumerians) and settled them in the land giving them the kingship and thus the first cities were created. A large part of the story is missing but at some point the gods decide not to save mankind from a flood which strikes destroying man and cites. Later the world is presumably repopulated.In addition there is the \u201cDebate between Summer and Winter\u201d a creation myth from the mid 3nd millennium. This details the creation of the land and seasons by Enlil. In it he is seen to irrigate the land \u201cguaranteeing the spring floods at the quay\u201d and to begin the agricultural tradition of the land \u201cmaking flax grow and barley proliferate.\u201dFinally and most interestingly for this topic is the \u201cDebate between Sheep and Grain\u201d another creation myth written in the mid-3rd millennium . The myth details a time in which sheep and grain were unknown to the land. The people \u201cwent about with naked limbs in the Land. Like sheep they ate grass with their mouths and drank water from the ditches.\u201d The myth ends with the virtues of grain being extolled \u201cfrom sunrise to sunset may the name of Grain be praised. People should submit to the yoke of grain.\u201dTherefore we can see that early history of Mesopotamia, the Ubaid period and before, is in Sumerian text seen in a divine light. The land was created by the gods as were the people and they were given cities and kingship. Enlil gave the people the summer and the winter, he gave them wheat and irrigation as Enki gave them kingship. Only in the \u201cDebate between Sheep and Grain\u201d is there indicated any knowledge of a time before sedentary agriculture. This myth clashes with that of the \u201cDebate between Summer and Winter\u201d though it is part of the same tradition indicating the lack of a unified view of their past. It seems that the Sumerians saw their past as part of a very real mythical tradition. Their kings begin as mythical figures and progress towards the non-mythical. The mythical and the non-mythical are closely linked in the Sumerian view of themselves and their pastI would conclude that the Sumerians did believe themselves to be not just the first civilization but the first people, it is part of their creation myth. In addition there was no knowledge in the way we would think of a hunter-gatherer life preceding their urban civilization.

For example, Icelandic airbases were among those that allowed the Allies to move aircraft (which could not cross the Atlantic in one flight) to the UK in two 'hops'; they were also extremely useful in anti-submarine operations.  Iceland was also in a strategic position with regard to North Sea shipping lanes, which saw serious action during the war thanks to German attempts to disrupt the US Lendlease contribution to the Soviet War effort via convoys to the ports in Archangelsk and Murmansk.

Crucially for our purposes, though, he lumped the Book of Jonah (which was and is in Protestant Bibles) in with them. The Catholic Church was...not happy, to say the least. His scholarship was censured and he lost his university chair.The tensions over Jonah were alive and well as much as a century later. You can hilariously see them play out in the 1911 Catholic Encyclopedia--[scroll down to \"Historicity.\"](_URL_0_) (Hint: it's most of the page.) >  Not a single Father has ever been cited in favor of the opinion that Jonah is a fancy-tale and no fact-narrative at all...To the Rationalist and to the advanced Protestant Biblical scholar these arguments are of no worth whatsoever. They find error not only in Jewish and Christian tradition but in Christ Himself. They admit that Christ took the story of Jonah as a fact-narrative, and make answer that Christ erred; He was a child of His time and represents to us the ideas and errors of His time. The arguments of those who accept the inerrancy of Christ and deny the historicity of Jonah are not conclusive.So there was, on one hand, a whole pile of curious resentment/resentful curiosity of the historicity of the Jonah legend. And on the other was the rise of natural history and naturalism in the public eye.One of the really awesome things about the explosion of interest in natural history as a more scientific endeavour than earlier \"making collections out of everything as curiosities\" is that so much of the work was concentrated in museums--putting all the developments, cool findings, animal displays that would NEVER pass ethical muster today, right in the public eye. (Plaster casting was gaining ground as its practitioners gained skill, though--in fact, lifelike whale models at the Smithsonian and the American Museum of Natural History were huge national news in the 1900s). And there was a massive market for it, too, in terms of public interest.Of course, one of the popular things to display--and see--was preserved animals and skeletons. And so you have a trickle of reports from the late 19th and early 20th centuries of, you guessed it, visitors taking the chance to see if they, like Jonah, could fit inside the belly of a whale.The most (in)famous account, which still gets play in fundamentalist Christian propaganda, is a 1928 recounting of a ca. 1900 youthful escapade: >  My own experience was in Birmingham about 25 years ago, when teh carcass of a whale was displayed for a week on vacant land in Navigation Street...I was one of twelve men who went into its mouth, passed through its throat, and moved about in what was equivalent to a fair-sized room. Its throat was large enough to serve as a door. Obviously it would be quite easy for a whale of this kind to swallow a man.There are a number of similar stories springing up around the time. Not formal experiments, but curious people. Did they actually happen, or is this the sort of \"No s---, there we were\" story that grows in the telling?It's interesting to note that there was also, at this time, something of a fad for repeating rumors of modern-day fishermen swallowed by whales. Biblical philologist Paul Haupt in 1907 (who does not accept Jonah as a true story, yet devotes pages upon pages to the question of whether the sea-creature was a sperm whale or a shark) throws the kind of scholarly shade that can only come out of biblical studies: >  It is of course impossible that Jonah should have been alive...after three days and three nights, although it is reported in [German newspaper] that the whaleman James Bradley was, in Feb. 1891, swallowed by a whale,  and on the following day he was taken alive out of its stomach...The sailors had much difficulty restoring him to consciousness. It was not til after three months that James Bradley recovered his reason. He seems to have been much more fortunate in this respect than some distinguished Biblical scholars.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The experiment was carried out in 1847 by the British scientist James Clark Ross.

The first discussion of McKellen's coming out I can find is [a profile of McKellen in the British newspaper *The Independent* from February 20th, 1988](_URL_2_), which is preserved on Ian McKellen's webpage as his writing (which it clearly is not). McKellen's coming out is portrayed as political activism in opposition to 'Clause 28', mooted legislation forbidding local governments to promote the idea that homosexual relationships might be normal. McKellen became involved in activism against Clause 28 in early January. Maybe one could say that the future Gandalf was trying to tell parliamentarians: you shall not pass...this bill. (Despite McKellen's activism, it became law in May)According to the summary of McKellen's activism about Clause 28 in the *Independent* article: > On Sunday, 24 January, he walked on stage and on to television screens at the Laurence Olivier Awards. \"The greatest surprise\", says one of the invited audience, \"was the roar of approval that greeted him when he mentioned Clause 28\". The next day he shepherded a host of stars, and one baby, on stage at the Playhouse, before journalists and Lords bussed down the Embankment for the occasion. The radio and television blitz followed, and by the end of the week homosexuality and censorship were issues of national interest in a way unknown since the late Sixties.   > To achieve this, McKellen played a very private card. One friend describes it: \"Coming out is the essence of gay liberation, and Ian understands that. There are only two or three other working actors who have done it, because it is dangerous. But he knew it was time to stand up and be counted.\" Though he described himself as gay in a World Service programme on 19 January, the declaration was made to most of Britain on Radio 3's Third Ear, on 27 January. > The occasion was a spirited argument with Peregrine Worsthorne. It provoked a remark about \"disgusting homosexual practices\" from the editor of the Sunday Telegraph, and a query laden with innocence from McKellen: did Mr Worsthorne mean the Garrick when he spoke about gay clubs? The following Sunday's leader did the Stop Clause 28 campaign no harm at all.Unfortunately, the archives of the London *Telegraph* do not appear to go back more than 20 years, and Peregrine Worsthorne's response to McKellen's coming out in his paper is not accessible online as far as I can tell.Additionally, McKellen wrote a piece for [*Capital Gay* magazine summarising his rather eventful 1988](_URL_0_). In it, he essentially claims that his homosexuality was not particularly a surprise to anyone in his life, given the theatrical circles he moved in: > That I had actually come out probably surprised me more than my being gay can have shocked any listener who knew my work. Indeed, some of them have written to say that they'd known I was gay for years and couldn't care less. When I told my step-mother, soon after, she said the same. My friends had always known; so had my fellow actors, because backstage there are few secrets. But I'd always avoided saying I was gay to the media - even to the gay press - insisting that my private life was my own. My complacency had involved nothing more embarrassing than the occasional white lie about not being married - I was never, though, one to talk about looking for the right girl and relishing parenthood.In terms of reaction in the US, the first mention I can find on Factiva is a reference in the *Boston Globe* to McKellen, in April 1988, winning the Norton Award for the best achievements in Boston-area theatre, for his one-man show, 'Ian McKellen Acting Shakespeare'. Giving a speech, accepting the award, according to a *Boston Globe* story by Jeff McLaughlin: > With regard to the denouement of McKellen's remarks -- in which he recounted his decision to publicly acknowledge his homosexuality and work for tolerance and rights for gay people in Britain -- not even Elliot Norton knew what was coming. Norton said, in a Wednesday note, that McKellen had asked for at least 20 minutes to speak, but did not discuss his topic beforehand. \"But he had planned it,\" Norton wrote, \"to the point of writing out his whole talk and, in the half hour or so before the ceremony, studying part of it before a dressing-room mirror.\" > McKellen's speech may well approach historic status, and it certainly will become part of Boston theater folklore, since no one had thought ahead of time to set up a tape recorder.One journalist's reference to McKellen from the point of view of someone not particularly inclined towards progressive views came from a review of the TV documentary Open Space on BBC2; Martin Cropper in *The Times* said of *Open Space* that: > Open Space (BBC2) illustrated the condition [of homosexuality] with some predictable examples: the 'spanking judge', for instance, who resigned his recordership after exposure in the tabloids; the 'out' lesbian who enlisted in the Wrens specifically to meet like-minded adults, without realizing that the armed forces are the only sphere where such activity has ever been illegal. The most intelligent comment was Ian McKellen's plea for respectable homosexuals to help erode prejudice by declaring themselves publically - a move which would, however, posit a different society. > As one has come to expect from access-television, the historical perspective was on the flimsy side. In this country at least, the 'homophobic' backlash started years before Aids had been heard of, for the obvious reason that some 'straights' had had it to here with the hectoring aggression of homosexual propaganda.Another reference to Ian McKellen discussing his homosexuality comes from an article in the *Sunday Times* about the filming of a ITV Phil Donahue special (i.e., with the American talk show host filming a British version of the show):  > On Wednesday the subject was clause 28. On the panel were two straights, Sir Rhodes Boyson and the Rev David Rushworth-Smith, and two gay actors, Ian McKellen and Michael Cashman, who plays Colin in EastEnders. Noisy claques in the audience booed Boyson and the vicar, and cheered the actors. > Donahue had been told that the reserved British would never speak out; luckily many present were Americans who can utter words like ``sexuality'' without a blush. > The debate goes like this. A fat woman is horrified to be surrounded by these homosexuals; a pigtailed young man says he's heterosexual but live and let live; a lesbian mother with two teenage children is rounded on by a man in favour of \"the normal family unit''; Donahue asks who is to say what is normal? And so on. When Boyson says, \"God created man and woman'' and McKellen rejoins, \"and together they created a homosexual'' such a sequitur is rare. > A grey-haired English woman declares with dignity, \"I am the mother of a gay son'', but we hear no more from her: it is time for a commercial break. After it, Donahue has found another old lady. She says: \"People who are born like that, it's like being a cripple isn't it? I mean they can't help it] Well, it's sad they're born, isn't it?'' > Nobody in the audience knows whether to laugh or cry.Ian McKellen was not the first theatre actor to come out as gay, as Simon Callow had come out in a book he wrote in 1984. In early June 1988, Callow mentions McKellen in a Diary piece written in *The Times*: > The latest such event has been inspired by that fumbling piece of legislation, Clause 28 of the Local Government Bill. To raise money for the possible victims of the clause, an extraordinary group of artists Simon Rattle, Dame Judi Dench, Mike Gambon and many others across the spectrum of the performing arts are appearing at the Piccadilly theatre this Sunday. The event has been largely inspired and organized by Ian McKellen. It was his cheeky notion to call the show Promoting Homosexuality (echoing the ambiguous phrasing of the clause itself) but the intention behind the show is not polemical; it simply represents the anxiety of a large number of performers about a piece of law that affects us all.Elsewhere, most of the references to Ian McKellen in Factiva from 1988 refer to his career continuing as per usual, which makes me suspect that nobody into theatre in England (or Boston) in the 1980s was enormously surprised, or cared particularly that a leading actor was gay; he starred as (the heterosexual) Profumo in the 1989 film *Scandal*. Ultimately, McKellen was knighted by the Queen in 1991; coming out in 1988 didn't stop him from symbolically being admitted to the establishment.Nonetheless, anti-homosexual prejudice in the wake of the AIDS epidemic had a support base within the Conservative Party, not least with Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher, who in a 1987 conference speech said that \"Children who need to be taught to respect traditional moral values are being taught that they have an inalienable right to be gay...all of those children are being cheated of a sound start in life. Yes, cheated!\" Clause 28 remained on the books until the Labor government voted it out in March 2003. McKellen relates in the *Capital Gay* piece discussed Clause 28 with Tories at Westminister:  > At Westminster, I met our lawmakers \u2014 and remembered their words: The Minister \u2014 \"I don't understand why young homosexuals need their own clubs \u2014 why can't they mix with everybody else of their own age?\"  The Whip in the Commons \u2014 \"I'm sorry about Section 28 \u2014 it's just a bit of red meat thrown to our right-wing wolves.\"  The Whip in the Lords \u2014 \"I'm sorry about Section 28 \u2014 but you appreciate my job is just to get our chaps to vote the right way.\"", "label": 0}, {"content": "The actor, who is now a professor at the University of Oxford, came out as gay on BBC Radio 4 in 1986.

Rapidly approaching spring thaw, which would seriously bog down the mechanized Red Army, complicate offensive operations, and give time for the Finns to regroup and possibly receive foreign help (see 2).Stalin had actually quietly dropped his support for the puppet government after January 1940, as the Red Army wasn't able to crush the Finnish resistance as planned. However, there are reasons to believe that he intended the 1940 Moscow Peace Treaty - that emasculated Finnish defensive lines - to be only an interim peace, followed by a renewed attack once the threat of Western intervention had passed. Accordingly, the Soviets firmly refused to permit Finland and Sweden to join into a mutual defensive pact, even though as one of the preconditions the Finns had officially renounced any claims to lost territories. Furthermore, during summer 1940, Soviet military buildup against Finnish border was alarming enough so that Finland came very close to ordering full-scale mobilization. It is also known from captured German archives that during that time, Soviet foreign minister Molotov asked the Germans for a \"free hand\" to move against Finland and finally complete the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement's agreed spheres of influence.

Counter factuals are often impossible to really give a complete answer to, because they inherently rest on something that did not happen. In this particular case, it is worth remembering that the Romans were not a Borg like species driven towards constant invasion and expansion--every addition to their empire had a particular reason to it.2. Rome only came into sustained close contact with Ireland well after the era of its expansion was largely over. The period of imperial growth for Rome is largely between 202 BCE and 9 CE, starting with victory in the Punic Wars and ending with Augustus' clarification of the borders. These two hundred odd years saw Rome expand from a polity that encompassed Italy, parts of Spain and the Italian islands, to one that had absolute control over the entire Mediterranean basin and Western Europe to the Rhine. The only significant additions after that were Britain, which was conquered because Claudius badly needed a military victor to bolster his legitimacy, and Romania, which Trajan conquered because he was a warmonger (the addition of Mesopotamia lasted barely any time at all, and the border changes aside from that were largely formalizations of earlier de facto Roman control, eg Nabatea and Judea). In particular, the imperial court worked very hard to quell the miltarized status competition amongst the Roman elite class, which did not fully explain the expansion but certainly provided a driving impulse.3. Ireland would have been very difficult to hold for very little gain. When we think of the Irish landscape, we tend to think of [this](_URL_0_), the rolling green hills which would have well suited Rome's legions and agriculture. But this landscape is intensely anthropogenic, created in recent times. In Roman times it would have been much more thickly forested, and covered in bogs and swamps of the sort that do not make for good invading. This can be seen in later history two, as part of the reason why the Norman occupation was, to an extent, a bit of a bust.4. There just wasn't that much. Irish archaeology is still a bit of a developing field (not nearly as developed as archaeology in Britain) so it is hard to tell, but it seems as though the Irish Iron Age (say 500-500) was one in which social formations were considerably less complex than in early or later periods--in other words, a \"dark age\". Roman conquest tended to be highly succesful where there was already centralized states and hierarchical social relations which Rome would co-opt to its use. In areas with looser social formations, such as Libya, Wales and interior Turkey, Roman power was much more tenuous and difficult to maintain. Apart fro the simple logistical difficulty of conquering the island, it would have been extraordinarily difficult to maintain.

First, very few of the people in Sparta were actually 'proper' Spartans, the vast majority were slaves called Helots, these slaves were a constant threat due to the possibility of revolt, and the fact that the Spartans themselves were pretty much forbidden to do any farming, crafting, or anything other than training for war, meant Helot rebellions were much more damaging than in other city states where citizens were at least somewhat sustainable. This system where the Spartans were full time soldiers and almost all the economic production was left to a slave force that was always in danger of revolting meant that Sparta had to spend a lot of their military just keeping the Helots in line.Sparta also had big problems with a forever decreasing population, their society wasn't really based on the family unit like most of the other city states (like Athens), but to the state. Males were taken from their families at a young age and lived in a barracks separate from even their wives until about 30, at least. This, as you can imagine did not really help with baby-making T_T. Even if a baby were born there was a chance the elders might decide the baby was unfit and have the child left to die of exposure.So pretty much: Sparta had very good soldiers because they could train to be soldiers full time, but the way their society was constructed meant that they had to spend most of their military power keeping the helots under control so they could have the food and supplies needed to maintain their full time soldiers. In addition, they also had a very low birth rate, meaning Spartan soldiers were very slow to replace.Athens didn't need to waste so much manpower keeping their slaves in line, and their birth rate was much higher(because they didn't do that thing where husbands lived apart from their wives) meaning they could absorb losses much better than the Spartans.The Spartans were a society that was pretty much incapable of growing, all their time, effort, and resources were spent just keeping their society running.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Spartans had a military that was highly disciplined and trained.

Sorry in advance! Okay, so Caesar in battle is a REALLY interesting topic that I don't get to talk about nearly enough. I'll discuss the first part of your question as WELL as your second - in that order, but it will be a bit of a read! Buckle up :DCaesar was, by birth, a member of the patrician class- and they were pretty much the upper crust of Roman society. And Roman society was inherantly martial - all the generals were politicians as well (Even if not all the politicians were generals), which caused LOADS of problems. Caesar himself was many things before he had himself appointed *governor* of Gaul. Note that I said *governor*...because governors were also generals of the legions in the region they were governing. (Hope that made sense)I'll start you off with Caesar's martial prowess! From Adrian Goldsworthy's *Caesar: Life of a Colossus:* >  [...] young aristocrats learned how to run, swim in the Tiber and fight with weapons, most particularly the sword and javelin. They were also taught to ride, and Varro, a near contemporary of Caesar's, tells us that at first he rode bareback rather than with a saddle. Much of the instruction in all these skills was supposed to be given by the father or another male relative.  >  [...] >  Caesar was slightly built and not particularly robust, but his great determination seems to have made up for this. Plutarch tells us that he was a natural horseman and we also read that he accustomed himself to riding with his arms folded behind his back, guiding the trotting horse with his knees. In later life his skill at arms was also praised and the Romans believed that all good commanders should handle sword, javelin and shield as well as they controlled whole legions.That's certainly not the most tedious quote I've typed out! But basically what he's saying is that **all** aristocrats of Caesar's social rank were required to at the very least train in weaponry - and although he was slightly built (as a slightly built man, I can sympathize), he had so much sheer *willpower* that he just didn't give a shit. One thing that Caesar was particularly famous for is his legendary *speed.* He pushed his men hard and moved fast enough to always be where his allies never expected him to be. Granted, he constantly outran his supply lines, and Barry Strauss jokingly states that Caesar had no understanding of logistics compared to other generals that we consider to be \"great.\" And yet, that agility won him engagements constantly, and he smashed Gallic army after Gallic army on the shields of his legions. Another aspect about Caesar that I have to emphasize - he was an extraordinarily charismatic individual! And as such, he was able to win over his legions with the same skill that he won over women (And he was THE player of his time). To emphasize on that a bit...here's a song that his legions sang during one of his triumphs! (Remember - soldier humour!) >  Men of Rome, keep close your consorts, here\u2019s a bald adulterer.Gold in Gaul you spent in dalliance, which you borrowed here in Rome. TL;DR, he fucked a lot of married ladies. But that's another story! :DI go [into detail on the loyalty that Caesar's men had for him here.](_URL_0_) But! I'll only quote the relevant part  < 3Quoting me!---So, the Battle of Pharsalus. One thing you HAVE to remember about Caesar is that he was a brilliant battle commander, and he's especially renowned for two things: His INSANE speed in pushing his men (He was always two steps ahead of his opponents, appearing places faster than anyone could ever expect), and the INSANE loyalty they had for him. Seriously, when I say insane...he could quell mutinies amongst them with ONE WORD. The battle that had immediately preceded Pharsalus, [Dyrrhachium](_URL_2_) was a devastating defeat for Caesar's forces. After it, his men were so ashamed that they apparently begged for decimation, the most infamous punishment of the ancient world. Another example of Caesar's men's INSANE devotion to him and his fame was exactly how far his soldiers would go for him in battle. Here's Plutarch on that: >  Such a man, again, was Cassius Scaeva, who, in the battle at Dyrrhachium, had his eye struck out with an arrow, his shoulder transfixed with one javelin and his thigh with another, and received on his shield the blows of one hundred and thirty missiles. In this plight, he called the enemy to him as though he would surrender. Two of them, accordingly, coming up, he lopped off the shoulder of one with his sword, smote the other in the face and put him to flight, and came off safely himself with the aid of his comrades.---Seriously, that last story is hilariously crazy. It literally sounds like a scene from a movie - and considering that Caesar's *Gallic Wars* were meant as propoganda, that might well have been the desired effect! But let's head to Gaul with this for more context on Caesar as a general - and we'll head to one of the greatest battles that the man fought. The Battle of Alesia. So Alesia was a crazy situation. Caesar had been putting down rebellion left and right in Gaul, when all of a sudden, this new leader comes up out of the woodwork, and his name was Vercingetorix. Stop for a sec. That's a fucking BADASS name. Seriously, if I didn't care about what happened to my future children in high school, I would name one of them Vercingetorix. Because that dude sounds like some sort of dinosaur - and (unfortunately, we don't have a description of him in *particular*) the Gauls were known for being tall, blonde haired barbarians, and the leader of them would not only have to have the strength of will, but also the strength as warrior. Anyways, this war leader starts causing loads of trouble, so Caesar catches up with him in the town of Alesia. Now Caesar, wily old fox that he is, doesn't feel like losing half his men to storming Alesia's strong walls. So he besieges the town. And by besieges, I mean he pulled a Caesar and set his army to building an 11 mile wall surrounding the city. Unfortunately for Caesar, the Gauls were able to get messengers out by cavalry to all the surrounding tribes - who knew that Caesar was just as pinned down as Vercingetorix was. Unfortunately for Alesia, it was a **big fucking town.** And a town that big has lots of people. And lots of people need lots of food - hence the point of a siege ;) Anyways! So as soon as the legions finished building *that* wall, Caesar told them to build another one. Facing out. You can just imagine how much manpower that took. Nevertheless, the number that Caesar gives for the army that came to relieve Alesia was about 260,000. And Alesia had at least 80,000 **fighting** men inside. And Caesar had about 60,000. Yeah, he was a TINY bit outnumbered here. But he was CAESAR dammitall. And here is the man's firsthand account of the battle. His... >  arrival was known through the colour of his cloak, which he always wore in battle as a distinguishing mark and the troops of cavalry and the cohorts which he had ordered to follow him were also visible, because from the higher parts of the hill these downward slopes and dips could be seen. Then the enemy joined battle: both sides cheered, and the cry was taken up by a shout from the men within the fortifications and rampart. Our troops threw their *pila* [spears] and got to work with their swords. Suddenly [the Gauls] spotted the cavalry behind them; other cohorts approached. The enemy turned around and were caught as they fled....In other words, Caesar was a mobile morale machine. Wherever he went, he held the line, and his men fought all the harder for his presence. Well, that and the reinforcements who were with him. But he was still a HUGE presence, not least because (remember earlier?) his men fucking LOOOOOOOVED their bald adulterer. Now, onto the last example. This one is years later - and in this battle, Caesar is said to have said that he 'had fought many times for victory, but at Munda, he fought for his life.'Caesar ordered his men to advance, and the opposing legions met them in combat. The fighting was INCREDIBLY fierce, despite the Pompeiian (they were fighting under Pompey the Great's son) forces being completely green recruits - and Caesar's legions were pushed back, which was a HUGE shock to everyone there.

Thus, any action would have been made under the Roman legal system, which differentiated heavily between citizens and non-citizens. The first question to ask is, were both of the parties (the pigheard and the mystic) Roman citizens? If yes, then the claim would fall under the *ius civile*, or the Civil Law. The *ius civile*, which had pre-Roman Republic origins, had become highly developed by the 1st century, with the principal sources of law being statutes \\[*leges*; singular *lex*\\] made by the legislative assemblies, and the Edict made by the Praetors (sort of like an Attorney-General, who held office for a year), which detailed the *formula* for various actions. There were two Praetors, who each had a different Edict: the Urban Praetor was in charge of Roman citizens, and the Peregrine Praetor was in charge of peregrines (non-citizens).One key thing about Roman law is that it is very much based around actions \\[*actiones*\\]: you had to go before the Praetor (who would often appoint an *iudex*, a judge) with a specific action for what you were claiming, which involved speaking specific words known as the formula, which would be unique to each action.  These actions must be taken from a closed list of actions stated in the Praetor's Edict, which until about 135AD (during Hadrian's reign) was revised every year. Some examples include the *actio emptii* (for a buyer to sue a fraudulent/non-performing seller under the law of sale), the a*ctio mandati* (to claim performance for a *mandatum* \\- a particular type of contractual promise) , and the *vindicatio* (for an owner of a property to claim his property back from someone who has taken it against his will).The action you would press for someone drowning your pigs would be for the *actio Legis Aquiliae*: an action based on the *Lex Aquilia*, a statute promulgated in the 3rd century BCE, that awarded compensation for specific acts that caused damage to property.Gaius, a 2nd-century Jurist, explains in his Institutes (a textbook of law): > The action for unjust damage, (*damni iniuriae*) is established by means of the Aquilian law (lex Aquilia), in the first chapter of which it is provided, that if anyone has illegally killed another's slave, or one of those quadrupeds that are accounted as cattle (pecudes) he shall be condemned to pay to the owner that amount which was the highest value of the thing at any time during the previous year.(Gaius, Institutes, 3.210-4)On the question of whether pigs were included in the category of *pecudes*, Justinian's Institutes (essentially a revised version of Gaius' Institutes with many portions copied verbatim, compiled in 535 AD) has this to say: > Swine are also held to be included, since they come under the term cattle, for they feed in flocks, as Aelius Marcianus notes in his Institutes that Homer, in the Odyssey, \\[refers to pigs as cattle\\].(Justinian, Institutes, 4.3.1)Therefore, you would go before the praetor pleading an *actio legis Aquiliae*, and if your evidence was accepted before the praetor (or more likely, an *iudex* or representative), the mystic would be compelled to pay you the highest value of your pigs in the previous year.Here\u2019s the really interesting part: it\u2019s possible, in theory, to make a profit through such an action. For instance, if your pigs became diseased and wasted in the past 2 weeks (such as from being possessed by demons), you could still claim for their highest value in the past year, which is likely more than what they would\u2019ve fetched you if you sold them on the open market. This might seem a strange concept that is offensive to principles of equity in many modern legal systems, but to the Romans this made perfect sense.This is because the *Lex Aquilia* covered what were known as delicts: something that was a combination of tort and crime, in that it was meant to be both punitive and compensatory. It didn\u2019t matter that you could make a profit from the mystic\u2019s actions \u2013 the law was designed to punish the mystic as much as it was designed to compensate you, especially since the Roman criminal legal system at the time wasn\u2019t very developed.Note that all of the above governs only Roman citizens, who were under the ambit of the Urban Praetor and the *ius civile.* Non-citizens (peregrines) were under the ambit of the Peregrine Praetor, whose Edict has mostly been lost to history. We do know, however, that some of the peregrine actions were similar or analogous to the *ius civile* actions. Professor David Daube (a leading scholar of Roman Law, and former Regius Professor of Civil Law at Oxford) has this to say (citation given at the end of this post): > it may be observed that certain features of the law affecting peregrines do look as if they had originated in the court of the urban praetor. For example, in a case of theft or damage to property, a peregrine sues or is sued by an action feigning him to be a citizen...We can thus assume that even if both parties were peregrines, the action and remedies would've been similar. & #x200B;EDIT: Some questions below have brought up interesting points, which I'll paste here. & #x200B;**On Intent**The Lex Aquilia did not have provisions for intent, and was strict liability. This is in contrast with theft (furtum) and insult/outrage (iniuria), which did require theftuous/contumelious intent. A likely explanation is that Lex Aquilia liabilities are perhaps meant to be more compensatory than punitive, as evidenced by its damage for the value of the thing damaged or killed, as opposed to theft, which compensates for anything between twofold to fourfold the value of the thing stolen.As such, it didn't matter if the mystic intended to kill the pigs - the only relevant question was whether he did kill the pigs; whether he caused the pigs to die. If he did, then he was liable under the Lex Aquilia. & #x200B;**On Direct/Indirect Actions**A very interesting point to note is that the Roman law did distinguish between direct and indirect actions. Gaius  tells us in his Institutes that the *actio legis Aquiliae* only lay if \"a person caused the damage by his own bodily act\", such as stabbing the pig to death. If instead the damage \"was caused in any other way,\" such as if a person has \"shut up another's cattle, so that they perished by starvation,\" this was considered an indirect action. In this case, the *actio legis Aquiliae* itself would not be available, but an equitable action \\[*actio utilis*\\] would instead be given. \\[Gaius, Institutes, 3.219\\]The difference is one of semantics in pleadings - the remedy was the same, and indeed the difference between direct and indirect actions seems very arbitrary. For instance, someone who throws another's slave into a river, causing the slave to drown, is considered to have caused the death directly rather than indirectly. Gaius states that this is \"not difficult to understand\", but to me it seems arbitrary.On one view, perhaps the correct action would be the *actio utilis*, rather than the *actio legis Aquiliae*. & #x200B;Sources:Gaius, Institutes (tr.

I will summarize the points as best I can into four points:1. It treats Greece and Rome as somehow originators rather than profoundly influenced by outside forces (also as a single unite but we will leave that aside) or, worse yet, as some stage in the \"progress of civilization\" that starts in Egypt, then Babylon, then Rome, etc. But Greek culture was profoundly influenced by its neighbors that were often richer, older, and more sophisticated. For example, every Greece art 101 class will trace the descent of Greek statuary from the [kouroi statuary](_URL_2_) of the sixth century BCE (to anchor your time frame, the Battle of Marathon was in 490 BCE) and how those statues were in turn from [Egyptian predecessors](_URL_1_). Likewise, the practice of bas relief is clearly influenced by Near Eastern predecessors. There are certainly regional variations, but that was not unique to Greece, and you would not confuse the [reliefs at Karatepe](_URL_0_) with those at Nineveh. This went far beyond artistic practice, as Martin West's *East Face of Helicon* demonstrated the influence of near eastern literature, mythology and cultural practice was profound in Greece.2. A point that I would not be surprised drives medievalists up a wall, it completely ignores the thousand year period between the sack of Rome and Lorenzo Valla. If \"western culture\" is defined by, say, Greek democracy then where was the Greek democracy in the court of Philip the Fair? There are certainly some literary survivals, the *Aeneid* and Ovid were always popular, but virtually the entire corpus of Greek literature was lost except a few Latin translations, and many of the Latin authors we consider exemplars of the Western ideal were basically ignored (Livy, for example). So what you are left with is this millennium long hole, a misguided detour on the glorious march from Sophocles to Shakespeare.3. It really profoundly underrates just how weird ancient world was to modern eyes. This is something that more modern depictions of the ancient world like HBO's *Rome* have done a good job with, but there is a real disconnect between the classical ideal as shaped by the Renaissance and what the classical world actually was. I think statues are another good example to use: when we look at a Roman marble statue and a Renaissance statue we are tempted to think \"aha, the similarity!\", but that initial reaction is pretty superficial. First, most famously, is the issue of classical Roman statues against pure white Renaissance, as the Renaissance sculptors may have *thought* they were imitating a classical ideal, but that ideal existed almost entirely in their own heads. It goes beyond superficial aesthetics and into the social function of art as well, as there is a temptation to when looking at a Roman statue like the Capitoline Venus to find the artistic intent of the individual creator as you would with a statue of Michelangelo, but what you don't see is that there are just a bunch of those statues, some with variations (particularly in the face) but basically identical. The whole social function and conception of art was radically different (ed: cf Cuomo *Technology and Culture in Greek and Roman Antiquity*). This goes to literature as well, there is a great book called *The Shock of the Ancient* by Larry Norman that points out that, despite the stereotype of ancient vs modern as being stodgy traditionalists vs freethinking visionaries, the flow of classical texts into the courts of early modern Europe was actually pretty destabilizing, and many of the people arguing against the absolutist tendencies of Louis XIV were using these profoundly strange ancient texts to make their point.4. Finally, and this is the point I feel is the most important, it completely ignores what *most* of the Greek and Roman world were. *Most* people under the Roman empire lived in the east, *most* art and literature were produced in the east, *most* of those lovely statues were made in the east, and *most* of the direct cultural survivals survived in the east. The architectural form of bazaars and suqs are pretty clear descendants of the Roman market, the Turkish bath is built like a Roman bath, the domes of the mosque are the real inheritor of classical temples, not the western European church. To say that the West descends from Greece and Rome is a claim of cultural ownership, to say that the *true* descendants of the glories of the past are the ones who live in what were insignificant outlying provinces, not the actual beating heart of the empire.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The academic consensus is that the origins of Western civilisation are a complex and multifaceted phenomenon.

However, more recent research suggests that these peoples (often known as the Taino) appear to have gone straight to the Greater Antilles, either skipping or at least not making permanent settlements in the Lesser Antilles. This is due to the fact that we don't really have much evidence for their presence in the Lesser Antilles, but have tons of evidence for their presence in the Greater Antilles. Though to be fair, it may just be that we haven't come across their settlements in the Lesser Antilles. If they did go straight to the Greater Antilles, this meant traversing the Caribbean South-North. As Fernand Braudel points out in The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Phillip II (concerning the 16th century), even most Mediterranean maritime cultures rarely traversed the open sea, instead preferring to hug the coasts for the most part. Most maritime trade was coastal, which helps explain the power, wealth, and influence of coastal cities and the city states or feudal lords who ruled them.There appears to have been trade with Meso America, as weapons particular to Meso America have been found in Taino settlements in the Greater Antilles but the workshops and tools which produced these stone weapons are nowhere to be found in the Caribbean. There also seem to have been settlements in the Turks Islands to the North of Cuba and East of Florida. The settlements there don't appear to have been permanent, instead focusing on local resources used for dyes which, once collected, were transported elsewhere.In both cases, this means trade and *demand* for products. It definitely looks like there was trade with both the mainland to the West (modern Mexico and the Central American Republics) and to the South (modern day Colombia and Venezuela). In addition, the Guanahatabey people of Western Cuba appear to have been originally from Florida while the trade in precious ceremonial resources in the Turks Islands suggests that trade networks went that far as well.There were also political systems with varying degrees of stratification. Hispaniola (modern day Haiti and Dominican Republic) seems to have had a fair number of chiefs who in turn gave tribute to other chiefs. Wars were organized at times as well, often using canoes to transport raiding parties.Without getting too much into the controversy of the Carib peoples of the Lesser Antilles, they are also alleged to have used massive canoes filled with dozens of people in raids.Part of the problem is that these were societies which had not yet adopted writing systems and many of the people who would have known about these trade networks and maritime conflicts. Because we have almost no written records and the few that we do have are often *very* influenced by the prejudices, language barriers, and political intentions of their authors, our understanding of the pre-Columbian Caribbean is profoundly warped and fragmented.As archeological research continues, in spite of the lack of funding, hopefully we'll find out more and have more of these theories confirmed.If you're interested in reading the classic text on this, you can read Irving Rouse's *The Tainos: Rise and Decline of the People Who Greeted Columbus*, written in the early 1990s. This is unfortunately almost 30 years out of date and the scholarship questions a lot of his ideas. For a more recent take, I strongly recommend William F. Keegan and Corinne L. Hofman's *The Caribbean before Columbus* as well as Keegan's *Ta\u00edno Indian Myth and Practice: The Arrival of the Stranger King* which dives really deep into the topic of the Taino in particular.Hope it helps.Edit: Also, a while back we did a great podcast episode with Dr. Antonio Curet of the Museum of the American Indian in DC.

The program you're talking about was *The Adventures of Superman* which aired from 1940 through 1951 and was sponsored by Kellogg's Pep Cereal (that's going to be important in this story later). Keen comic book historians will note that this show began airing a mere two years after Superman's first comic book appearance in 1938 (Action Comics #1). This shows just how quickly Superman, and the whole concept of superheroes, had risen in popularity (in the wake of Superman, you had Batman, the Human Torch, Namor, and many lesser known debuts before the '30s ended). By the mid-40s, the entire nation was obsessed with superheroes and, of that group, Superman was king.   Of course, one of the biggest reasons for Superman's rapid rise of popularity (and superheroes in general) was WWII. In every iteration (comic book, newspaper strip, radio show), Superman battled Nazis and Axis powers and bolstered the morale of American boys and girls nervous about the fates of their fathers and brothers overseas. It was the perfect combination, a villain so powerful and evil it could only be met by a hero with superpowers.    And then the War ended in 1945 and the creators of these superhero stories were faced with a dilemma. Whom would the most powerful beings in the world face now that Hitler was gone?    Enter human rights activist and author Stetson Kennedy. Kennedy wanted to expose the inner workings of the Ku Klux Klan to the world and so infiltrated the Klan and recorded everything he witnessed. (It should be noted that the Klan during the '40s is considered the Second Klan, and was different from the Klan of the '60s or the Klan of the 1800s. The nation was greatly divided in their opinions about the Klan and many associated the Klan with fascism) Kennedy took all of his notes exposing illegal activity on the part of the Klan to the police, however the local police refused to do anything about it, reportedly because the Klan had infiltrated the police force.    And so you had a group of writers looking for a new villain comparable to the Nazis and an activist wanting to expose a group many saw as fascists in America. It was a match made in heaven.    \"The Clan of the Fiery Cross\" was a fifteen part series that aired in  1946. In the story, an Asian-american kid named Tommy Lee needs Superman's help as he and his family are facing opposition from a mysterious group that wears hoods and terrorizes the minority community. In the series, the writers used the information given to them by Kennedy, including code words, strategies, etc. and built a villain that was recognizable to their audience. And the audience loved it.    And the Klan did not. The Klan petitioned Kellogg's to order the writers to stop the series or drop the show all together. But the reaction of the public was so unbelievably positive, Kellogg's denied the claim. This would prove to be a fatal blow to the Second Klan. The entire organization fell apart on a national level and, from the '50s through the '60s, any Klans that rose up were local groups with no true national leadership. And when the Klan rose up, they faced a reality that America now viewed them as comic book status villains instead of the freedom fighters they had hoped to portray themselves as.    One trivia item of note, you talked about how Superman had as association with \"all-American\" values, and you probably think of the phrase \"Truth, Justice, and the American way.\" The tag on, \"The American way,\" wasn't included in the radio show and only became part of the Superman vernacular until much later.

Your question is intimately tied to the history of automotive magazines, and I\u2019m not aware of a really good, academic history exploring that.

But they were more industrial news for makers and sellers of cars than consumer opinion for many years.  Prior to the development of the car review, automotive magazines experimented with being industry publications full of sales data and how-to repair guides, but the car review we know today was a post-world war II creation. The father of the modern car review - a journalist\u2019s opinion of the car based on their experience of driving it - was American Tom McCahill, and he\u2019s widely credited within the industry as the first to publish 0-60 times.  He convinced Mechanix Illustrated to publish the first such article, where he reviewed his own personal 1946 Ford Coupe, which, he noted, got from a dead stop to 60 mph in about 23 seconds.  He left us no notes on how he made this measurement.  But he repeated the test in subsequent reviews. Why did he pick 0-60 instead of, say, 0-50?  Sad to say, no one seems to have recorded his answer. I will note that it\u2019s quite close to a 0-100 kph measurement, which would seem intuitively more logical. But I have no evidence that he even considered this.  Models at the time were generally not sold on multiple continents, so it seems doubtful that it entered his mind. Both his review format and his test caught on. By the middle 1950s, publications like Sports Cars Illustrated (today known as Car and Driver) and Motor Trend made it the heart of their content, and they all published 0-60 times. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that they didn\u2019t all use a standard technique and haven\u2019t stuck with the same technique all along. Innovations in drag racing particularly changed the numbers \u2014 beginning in the 1960s, drag strips used a light beam system to measure time \u2014 and in the U.S., enthusiast magazines rented time on these for testing. Because of the way they trigger, the machines allowed the car to roll about 1 foot before they began to measure.  The technology has changed, but to keep their numbers consistent, many publications still test with \u201cone foot of roll-out.\u201dThis practice never caught on in Europe, where drag racing was never a significant phenomenon. Hence, American and European publications tend to use different methods that can produce different measurements. In a world where enthusiasts argue over every tenth of a second, that becomes a little humorous. Hope that helps.

Probably gonna be gone for 6-8 hours at the time of this post.)---The oldest one I can tell you about is (shock and awe!) the counterculture movement in the late Republic period of the Romans. That might be a shock to you (Heck, counterculture movements go back that far? Now way!), but the reason we know about it is because of our fantastic records of Roman....well...everything. Unfortunately, many of the records we HAVE are from people who weren't fond of said counterculture movement (such as Cicero's letters), but I'll happily quote some material so you can get an idea of who these people were! First off, I'm going to note - Cicero always spoke of these people with derision, very similarly to how a conservative in the modern day would speak of a hippy generation. The youth of the Late Republic were...well...not overfond of the establishment. The establishment and the culture of Rome was that men were clean shaven - indeed, all of the great men of Rome are portrayed as beardless, paintings of Romans almost always show them as completely clean-shaven, and the \"gateway ritual\" to manhood, as it were, was when a boy shaved for the first time. So, of course, these \"hotheaded youngbloods,\" as Cicero calls them, sported beards. First off, there was a man named Catiline in Rome - who was at the centre of one of the most well-known conspiracies of all time (The Catiline conspiracy), and, without getting into too much detail on this, he (supposedly) tried to lead a revolt and kill a whole buncha Romans, but before he could, the Senate had him (and his followers) dragged from their beds and killed without a trial or anything (which was ANATHEMA to Romans. Citizens had RIGHTS dammit, and that was one of their inviolable ones - to always be allowed a trial, especially concerning the death penalty). So, these hotheaded youngbloods who supported him (generally the more liberal youth - they were called the *populares*) adopted a beard that was known as the \"Catiline chinstrap\" in protest and support of Catiline. Needless to say, this would have been the kind of drama that would have lasted for months on the front page of Reddit, or CNN, or BBC, or what have you. If there was a People Magazine precedent, Rome was IT. Anyways. So there was this dude named Clodius who was a(nother) guy who would have been a gossipworthy celebrity. Think of a Roman (male) Lindsay Lohan. He (supposedly) slept with his sister, was involved in the most hilariously infamous incident of crossdressing ever (which caused G. J. Caesar to divorce his wife with the quote \"The wife of Caesar must be above suspicion\"), and just loved causing drama - he also did something that no Roman had ever done before. He lowered himself from the patrician rank (he was from one of THE most prestigious families in Rome) just so he could become tribune of the plebians, JUST so he could get back at Cicero. Yeah, he was a character. ANYWAYS. So the Senate tried to hold a trial for that crossdressing incident (they didn't know WHAT the fuck to do. He was intruding on a sacred religious rite, and no one had ever done anything like this before), and the youth, who really liked Clodius, sported goatees instead. From Cicero's letters! >  Affairs in Rome stand thus: The Senate is quite an Areopagus, throroughly resolute, strict, and courageous. When the day came for the bill to be put to the Assembly under the terms of the senatorial decree, there was a flocking together of our goateed young bloods, the whole Catilinarian gang with little Miss Curio at their head, to plead for its rejection. Consul Piso, the proposer of the bill, spoke against it. Clodius' roughs had taken posession of the gangways. The voting papers were distributed without any 'ayes.' Suddenly up springs Cato [He was the strict, 100% moral, HUGELY conservative guy] to the platform and gives Consul Piso a spectacular dressing down, if one can apply such a term to a most impressive, powerful, in fact wholesome speech.He goes on for a bit, but you get the concept ;) Clodius became (after he de-classed himself and got elected to the tribunate) almost a gang boss, taking over most of Rome with his gang of toughs (that was aforementioned), which devolved into one of the biggest gang wars that I can remember - It eventually became a contest between Pompey's gang and Clodius' gang (who were financed by Crassus, the richest man in Rome, who didn't like Pompey all that much, even though they were triumvirs together.) Fun story though!Though another man who would be considered a role model to the rebellious youth of Rome would be a figure you've probably heard a lot about - Gaius Julius Caesar, who had grown up in a not-so-great part of town, yet was hugely popular with the people. He's famous for being extravagent - and breaks with tradition constantly (Remember Cato, the traditionalist I was talking about earlier? Yeah, they pretty much hate each other's guts.) When Caesar was a young man, there was a guy in charge of Rome (He sort of conquered the city and made himself dictator) who's name was Cornelius Sulla. Sulla hated Caesar's ass too - mostly because he thought that \"In that man goes many a Marius.\" (Gaius Marius is the guy who caused the civil war that made Sulla into a conquering dictator in the first place - and he's the first one to have given the word \"Dictator\" a bad name. Sulla purged everyone who was affiliated with Marius, and it was really a bloody mess, but that's besides the point.) Only reason he didn't purge Caesar is because his friends like Caesar and convinced him not to. Caesar, at that point, was....well....for lack of a better term, he was a hippy, and many conservative Romans would have considered his manner of style feminine! (Goatees were considered feminine. As a man with a goatee, I personally find that hilarious.) He himself may have sported a goatee when he was young (we don't have any sources, but the youth copied the everliving FUCK out of him, so...), though it's also rumoured that he had every hair except the ones on top of his head plucked (pubes, armpit hair, chest hair, beard hair, leg hair, ass hair), he wore his toga long and flowing, with fabric that was \"transparent as a veil,\" (nuff said.) and he wore that toga \"loosely belted.\" He attached sleeves to his toga, and added a fringe, and he was EXTREMELY fastidious with his hair throughout his life - when he started to go bald, he wore a toupee, and carefully combed his hair over his bald spot to try to hide it. Speaking of his baldness....well...Roman beliefs were that the more promiscuous a man was, the more bald he was gonna get. Caesar pretty much slept with EVERYONE - heck, I'll tell you a story about the Catiline conspiracy here. So Caesar was actually suspected in the Catiline conspiracy as plotting against the Republic - and Cato (conservative dude) was one of the main speakers against him. Cato was on the Senate floor giving one of his speeches when suddenly, a messenger came in for Caesar and handed him a note. Cato, seizing on this to try to make Caesar look bad, pointed at Caesar and demanded he hand the note over and have it read before the Senate. Turns out...that note was a love letter. A GRAPHIC love letter. From Cato's sister. Awkwaaaaaaaard.But yeah, there's your example of an ancient counterculture. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask!---TL;DR - they certainly did!

When former ambassador Averell Harriman visited Moscow in 1976, he reported that General Secretary Brezhnev did not seem to understand what Nixon did that necessitated his resignation and express fear that it would undo the \"great progress\" the US and the USSR made together under detente. The Soviets feared that the loss of a partner in the US might jeopardize US-Soviet relations in the same way that FDR's death in 1945 brought in a president more hostile to the USSR.The Soviet political culture, with its weak institutional and legal checks on executive power, meant that its leadership had trouble coming to grasps with the idea that the president could be forced to resign over abuses of power in violation of the law. Most Soviet officials considered the whole impeachment process not as a matter of constitutional constraint on presidential power, but rather a conspiracy of ultra-rightists who opposed detente, newspapers, and disgruntled democrats to depose Nixon. While others, such as the Soviet deputy procurator general, thought the whole affair was \"for show\" and that Nixon would survive if he just \"showed a little firmness\". Soviet Americanists are however, are at least closer to the mark. The Soviet political scientist Valentin Zorin described Watergate as a function of a power struggle between congress and the president, each of whom represented certain economic \"monopoly groupings\" power bases inside the US. Watergate was a reaction against the increasing power of the presidency and Nixon's powerbase and attempted to \"correct\" the balance of power in American politics. The political scientist S. B. Chetverikov described it as a power struggle to contain the power of an autocratic presidency. The Americanists in the USSR broadly perceived Watergate as a reaction against the overly autocratic tendencies of one president, which they understood through their own history with Stalin.The one way Watergate did change Soviet perception of the US is to give them more respect to the power of congress as well as the constitution to guard against the power of the president.

That said, I'll give it a shot.So one of the casualties of WW1 was the Ottoman Empire, which was essentially carved up into different regions, some of which were administered by the French, some by the British, and then there was Turkey. Over the next 60 or so years (and this is obviously an INCREDIBLY abridged history,) you had a number of major events.**Independence and messy borders.** The British and French gave up their holds on the Muslim world, leaving behind states with boundaries that they drew. The problem with this was that the boundaries drawn didn't make any sense. You had Alawites and Sunnis living under one roof. Sunnis and Shias, Turks and Kurds, Kurds and Arabs, etc. The borders simply didn't correspond to any sort of nation state. These societies were still very much tribal, so this matters a lot to these people. A Sunni doesn't want to be ruled by an Alawite, a Kurd doesn't want to be ruled by a Turk, etc.This is part of the reason why you keep seeing these \"secular/moderate\" dictators like Gadaffi, Hussein, the Assads, etc. These people consolidate power and base their legitimacy upon the need for an authoritarian arm to rule over the warring tribes. These authoritarians then cut off any source of peaceful legitimate opposition (although a lot of the opposition wasn't peaceful to begin with) which caused it to move underground, into the mosques. One of the best examples of this is Iran in the 70s-- the Shah's authoritarian grip made any sort of political dissidence impossible, so organized religion quickly became the only outlet for opposition against authoritarian rule. This of course led to the 1979 Islamic uprising.(While I'm here let me quickly plug /r/MidEastRegionalWar, a subreddit dedicated to exploring how the faulty borders in the region are playing out today)**Israel.** I'm going to be brief here because this is a really emotionally charged topic, but... the formation of Israel and the failure of Arab leaders to \"deal with it\" in 49, 67, 73, was and remains easily one of the biggest reasons behind and one of the biggest outlets for distrust of authority, peddling of conspiracy theories, and the rising of a feeling of a need for a pan-Arab or (when that failed) pan-Muslim identity.**Oil.** During both the first and second World Wars, the allies quickly discovered how much they needed oil to fight, and were willing to do pretty much anything necessary to ensure the safety of their oil supply from the well to their engines. This is a large part of the reason why the US has been a backer of the Sauds, why the French, British, and Israelis fought Egyptians in 1956, why the US/UK overthrew Mossadegh in 53, and overall why regional security is so important to the US. This has led a lot of Arabs/Muslims to feel that they are not in control of their own destinies and that it is the American/British/Israeli puppet masters that are pulling the strings, which has brought more and more people into extremism.On top of that, Oil wealth causes massive inequality because some people get the profits, while others simply don't. This is evident all over the world in energy producing countries, but even in countries that use oil revenues for welfare, there is both massive inequality, and almost more importantly, the oil revenues prevent the necessary economic structures that would create an actual functional economy from forming. This keeps youths poor and disenfranchised, without much of a hope of a future, which orients them toward extremism. Oil wealth has buoyed the House of Saud which took control of Saudi Arabia in the 30s into a regional powerhouse, and one of the driving forces in global Islam. The House of Saud is rooted in Wahhabism, (the Sauds and the Wahhabis aligned in the 1700s,) an extremist/literalist interpretation of Islam that promotes religious violence against anyone who isn't a hardline Islamist. Osama Bin Laden is probably the world's most famous Wahhabi warrior. The Sauds have used their oil money to promote Wahhabism around the world, most notably in the 1979-1989 resistance against the Soviets in Afghanistan, where the Sauds spent billions of dollars to both arm the rebels and to build Wahhabi madhrasahs (religious schools)in Pakistan, where many would-be terrorists ended up being radicalized. While it isn't clear whether Bin Laden attended one of these schools, he was definitely a recipient of Saudi money while he was in Afghanistan, building a network of religious fighters that would eventually form the beginnings of al-Qaeda. There is so, so much more that I should say to give you a more thorough background on this, but I think that for the most part this is a decent overview. I would recommend looking into things like the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, and things that Bin Laden has actually said.Let me know if you have any questions, and I hope this helped.[These ares some good books.](_URL_0_)", "label": 0}, {"content": "World War I and its aftermath affected the development of radical Islamic philosophy in many ways.

Two changes in particular affected royals' daily life. The first was the rise of bureaucracy, creeping slowly upwards until the 12th or 13th century when it really took off. The second was the dominance and slow decline of \"peripatetic\" government--that is, \"moving around.\" The entire royal court would up and haul from lord to bishop-lord to lord to city and back. Early and high medieval chronicles from Germany are filled with \"The king spent Christmas at Augsburg and the New Year at the palace of the bishop of Trier and in March he created Eberhard as bishop of Bamberg at that palace.\" The point being--for much of the Middle Ages, kings spent a lot of their time traveling! The situation is more ambiguous for queens. We see plenty of queens regnant in the late Middle Ages, mostly of smaller principalities, so both time and place made their governments much less peripatetic. It's not always clear from chronicle accounts whether queens consort were travelling with their husbands, and in many cases, we'd expect not. Some definitely did, though. Violant of Bar, queen of Aragon around 1400, is a great example--she even had her own perambulation to her own palaces, met with her own governing councils...bordering on \"co-government\" with her husband.But royals couldn't be on the road or leading armies 100% of the time. When we look at daily activities, it's important to keep in mind that kingship and queenship were more than listening to advisors and making decisions. \"Political culture\"--rituals, appearances, relationships--was almost or even equally vital to political power and governance.The first and most important part of keeping up appearances was religion. Regardless of whether royals *were* pious, they had to appear to be. Queens consort in particular were expected to spend a significant portion of the day at prayer, and kings seem to have done so as well. Many of the most elaborate prayer books of the late Middle Ages belonged to royalty, like Queen Elizabeth of York's Book of Hours.Attendance at Mass could also be important. Special Masses were an important occasion for crown-wearing by the reigning monarch--a show of power.Activities like hunting or falconry also occupied monarchs' time. It was probably partially *fun*, at least for some kings and queens; it was probably also a time when court members invited along could gain an informal ear. But even more, it was just a time to cement relationships. This was especially important in the days of peripatetic kings. The major reason for the ambulatory court in the first place was to bring the ruler in contact with princes (high nobility).There was time for what we would consider more traditional governing activities as well. Christine de Pizan describes King Charles V (not that Charles V) discussing affairs with his royal council on a near-daily basis, although her picture is an idealized one for propaganda purposes. \"Paperwork\" was another joyous occupation. That might just mean giving approval to charters transferring land. But queens like Margaret of Anjou also spent a good amount of time reading and writing letters, involving herself as mediator in complaints between tenants and landlords or among petty nobles.And uniting the idea of relationship-building with governing, there would be ample time to receive visitors and hear petitions formally and informally. When Duchess Kunigunde of Austria was princess of the Holy Roman Empire at the end of the 15th century, she often acted as mediator between visitors and her father. That would be a great example of time for informal meetings, since in general ruling monarchs were not \"supposed to\" (appearances again) spend time with their families.How much time queens consort spent with their children probably varied a lot. Scholars usually stress queens' *interest* in their children, although that could mean overseeing their education from afar. Our letter-writing queen, Margaret, also wormed her way onto her son's advisory council while he was being educated away from court. I can't think of reading anything about princes consort as fathers, or really that much at all. (It was probably in the interest of queens regnant to keep their husbands as much out of the spotlight, and thus the sources, as possible.)Meals offered another chance to display, exercise, and award power. In the queen consort's apartments, for example, which ladies-in-waiting were granted a place at the queen's table for any given meal was a big deal. The privilege to serve the queen her food was even more desirable. And that was just \"private\" dining! Major feasts and parties were not necessarily a *daily* activity, but they formed an important part of royals' lives. Observers like Hans von Planitz, representing Frederick the Wise at 1520s Reichstag conventions, even relate to their noble or royal employers who the best *dancers* are--to relate \"what people are saying\" as important state information, not just fluffy gossip.Finally, there would have been time for what we would consider \"leisure,\" although it might overlap with other purposes. That could include things like going for walks in palace gardens, playing chess, listening to books or reading them firsthand, playing with pet dogs.Especially playing with pet dogs, and in the late Middle Ages, especially little white fluffers. [The story I'm going to tell](_URL_0_) comes from 1709, which is not the Middle Ages, and from a letter by the Duchess of Orleans, who is not technically royal. But it well illustrates the importance of puppers in medieval and early modern royal life (and also, it's the best primary source on the Internet): >  One of my little dogs has just jumped up on thetable, seized my paper and torn a word, as you see.

It is of course possible some individual soldiers hadn't hear the news, but all commanding officers were well aware of when to cease combat, and even if not officially informed, rumors were filtering through all day. In part, the *reason* that it was not immediate was due to the fact that it would take time to coordinate across the front so as to ensure that all parties were aware of what was to happen, and ensure it was coordinated properly. Imagine if it was to go into effect a mere hour later, and the British had by that time let all their commanders know, but the Germans hadn't yet, and then to the British perspective the agreement was broken. An embarrassing fiasco at the least, and a possible rupture of the Armistice entirely, further prolonging the war in the worst case scenario.In sum, to work, *everyone* needs to know about the Armistice. Now, this brings us to your first question, which obviously is more the meat of it. As word filtered around, and more and more soldiers learned that there was a definite end only hours away, *why would they continue to fight?* To be sure, many did not. Many local commanders were happy to allow their men to hunker down and watch the hands of their watches, creeping agonizingly slowly, no doubt, up to 11. This was not universally so however. It must be kept in mind that this was not a peace treaty ending the war. That would only be signed the next year after half a year of discussion and negotiation that culminated in late June at Versailles. An Armistice was only a ceasefire, and at the time of its signing, it was an uncertain one as well, the Allies not aware of the extend of internal collapse faced by Germany. Although events would show it to be unnecessary in any case as the lines were not maintained until the signing, the Central Powers evacuating their troops as agreed upon, it is with mere hindsight we can be certain of that, and many officers felt that they ought to still do their best to prosecute the war up to the final minute so as to ensure that if the Armistice broke down, they would be best placed to resume hostilities. One example of this was a British brigade then occupying positions along the Dendre River. Knowing that if they had to take up arms again soon, the bridge to their front would be a vital necessity in making a crossing, they felt it necessary to ensure it was not in German possession at 1100. Orders came down at 0930 that they had an hour and a half to capture it, which they did in due course, although Gen. Freyberg narrowly missed meeting a German bullet for his efforts. Capturing over 100 Germans, it is likely that their opponents' hearts weren't in it.The execution of these orders to prosecute to the end could also be somewhat amusing. A South African recalled in the final minutes of the war a German machine gunner, firing off his gun across No Mans's Land up until the end, only to then stand up at 1100, \"take off his helmet, bow, and then walk slowly to the rear\". Perhaps he was merely emulating the artillerymen, many of whom kept up non-stop barrages up until the last minutes, cynically, it is said, because it was easier to expend the ammunition than have to carry it all back with them.This was also the case on other fronts as well. While the Western Front saw only a single morning between signing and execution, the Armistice signed some days earlier on the Italo-Austrian Front was done with a full 24 hours before it went into effect, allowing much more sizable operations, as the Italian's pushed their men forward, and the Austrians in turn did little to stop them, mostly having no interest in being that ignominious final, useless casualty. The provision had been insisted upon by the Italians, likely just for that reason, as it would give them one final day of \"glory\" to avenge the drubbing the Austrians had so often visited upon them. The Americans took advantage of the opportunity too, a small expeditionary force having been sent to the front in solidarity with their allies and not yet 'blooded' in the field. Their officers didn't want to miss out on the experience of combat, so despite the \"unsoldierly passivity on the part of the enemy\" went to make the most of the opportunity in the final, waning hours. It was an attitude reflected right up to the top, echoing the sentiments of Gen. Pershing, who in discussions with the Supreme War Council about concluding the war during those final months, he had been one of the most forceful, believing an Armistice only the right course of action if the strictest of provisions could be implemented, and doubting that the Germans would be sincere right up into November of that year. In a letter he wrote on 30 October, concerned that any terms, however favorable, would be to the detriment of the Entente forces, he noted: > I believe the complete victory can only be obtained by continuing the war until we force unconditional surrender from Germany, but if the Allies Governments decide to grant an armistice, the terms should be so rigid that under no circumstances could Germany again take up arms.As it were, the latter was not unlike the way things turned out. Harsher terms could, perhaps, have been applied, but the state of the German military ensured that what terms were implemented were sufficient to destroy their military standing.Again though, [it all was for nothing](_URL_0_). The Germans, let alone their Austro-Hungarian counterparts, were a broken force. By the time the negotiations at Versailles were reaching their culmination, in compliance with the Armistice Agreement, all occupied territory had long been evacuated, and the Allies armies had begun their occupation of the Rhineland. The small window for bad faith resumption of hostilities had closed within days, and by that point there was truly no alternative. The after-knowledge adds further sad notes to the scene. Gunther was hardly alone in dying do uselessly. Lt. J.W. Muirhead remembered the sad sight of three dead British soldiers he saw on the final day, all wearing the Mons Star awarded to the 'The Old Contemptibles' who had served in 1914; having survived the entire war only to fall useless when victory was already grasped. They were joined by thousands casualties more that day.It would be the Americans, as in Italy and in line with Pershing's combative attitude, who perhaps exemplified this more than anyone else, with orders such as \"absolutely no let-up in the carrying out of the original plans until 11 o'clock\" being quite typical for the AEF that morning. Gunther, serving in the 313th Infantry had been part of an attack on Ville-devant-Chaumont, a small French village in Lorraine. It is speculated that, having recently been busted down from Supply Sergeant to Private after the military censors noted a letter he had written home griping about the poor conditions, he was motivated by a strong desire to prove himself and be redeemed. Accounts by his friend Ernie Powell note that he burst out of cover to charge a German machine-gun position by himself, and the Germans initially attempted to wave him away in fact, only shooting him down when it was clear he would not be deterred. He was cut down a minute short of the ceasefire, and while due, perhaps, to his own poor decision, it was against the backdrop of the larger final push by the AEF that morning (n.b. I've spent more time than it is worth trying to see exactly what Gunther knew. Best implied he was unaware of the Armistice, but this doesn't comport with other sources, either primary or secondary, with it seemingly generally agreed that the unit had been informed in the past hour, and that everyone was by then aware, with Gunther ignoring shouts from both sides to stay put, and even a direct order from his sergeant).Gunther's death, or more properly, the death of him and his fellow soldiers that day, were controversial enough that after the war it sparked a Congressional investigation by Republicans, who had taken control of Congress in 1918, into whether it was proper to have continued the fighting right up to the minute. Pershing himself was called to testify before the investigation in November, 1919, where he reiterated the perspective he had offered in his communications with the Supreme War Council a year earlier, namely that *\"we did not know what the purpose of it was definitely, whether it was something proposed by the German High Command to gain time or whether they were sincere in their desire to have an armistice\"*, and as such he, as did the overall Commander-in-Chief Marshal Foch, felt it did not warrant allowing the ceasefire to be implemented in *practical* terms earlier.1/2", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Armistice was signed at 5.45am on 11 November 1918.

This began with classical scholars such as Aristotle, Galen and Hippocrates, who argued that females were fundamentally different in terms of structure than men, and a departure from the norm. By around the thirteenth century, this works had been translated into Latin and introduced to the learned elite. Because these scholars were so appreciated by humanists, a lot of their medical writing went unchallenged and so this filtered into medieval and Renaissance thought.During the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries there was heightened interest in anatomy and dissection, and for those interested in studying female anatomy the central focus of this was the womb, largely because of the primogeniture system of society. Paternity was fragile, and female fidelity was crucial to this, so medicine began to be used in a way to justify women's roles as mothers above all else.Although human dissection was rare (particularly of women) the most ludicrous theories about female anatomy were dispelled in this way, but beliefs about the womb were simply adapted to fit new evidence, rather than dismiss them completely. The entire idea around analysing women was to understand how exactly women were these imperfect versions of men, and uncover the \"secrets of women\", a popular phrase used then to refer to their sexual reproductive organs. The De Secretis Mulierum argued that the womb cured ailments, and in turn men could expel sicknesses in the womb. Another writer at the time, Joubert, argued that the womb's temperature was important - baby girls needed to be kept warmer than baby boys as they needed longer to reach maturity. These texts were therefore being used as tools to justify femininity as weak whilst claiming 'real' medical evidence to back it up, in an attempt to gain some control back over the uncertainty of paternity. These medical texts emphasised male strength in sperm, whilst the woman's womb was weak, bolstering the importance of the father and diminishing the mother's influence.It was entirely the womb that dominated female anatomy - showing the male almost obsession with it. This was because in their eyes, the womb was a woman's only purpose: being a mother. The other side to this was menstruation, which was seen as punishment from Eve's downfall, and a way of punishing women for their sexual desires. Monstrous birth stories in the sixteenth century were always blamed on a woman being too sexual. However, it was acknowledged to be essential and many medical texts offered remedies to provoke it rather than suppress it because it was a sign of fertility; women were just expected to feel guilty about it. It was also used as a way to justify women not be suitable for learning, because it was said to deaden their brain, and instead it was suited for motherhood because in being with a man they receive heat and this warms up their \"frigid natures\"! Pregnancy obviously also dominated gynaecological thought. Bastard children were blamed solely on mothers and their sexual depravity, and it was believed that women controlled which gender a child was. The ideal case was a son who resembled their father as this meant the female aspect was completely sacrificed.In conceiving a child a woman could not show herself to be sexual, because it was believed that a woman who had lots of sexual itnercourse produced weak foetuses, or none at all. Their looks were judged upon also and only one person (Savonarola) acknowledged the idea that a woman should enjoy the sex to conceive, advising rubbing her clitoris and caressing her nipples! Although some others believed women orgasming was necessary, it wasn't so that she could enjoy it, but more to speed the process up.Overall, women were viewed as sexual, destructive and dangerous people who needed to be controlled, and the field of gynaecology contributed to this by having a medical justification and a biological basis to societal concerns. They were able to rationalise a lot of thought at the time, and through the development of this field, established a male authority on \"women's secrets\" that took over from wise women and midwives. There was an overall distrust of female control of sexuality and motherhood was the way to control this by spouting ideas that it helped their health, and they were inherently weak and depended upon men.Gynaecology was a way of asserting power over women,and sex differences in general were used to define and shape society. Gender roles were a powerful tool for submission, and it was this representation of all that a \u201cWoman\u201d should be, through the trusted authority of medicine, that allowed them to separate men and women further.References (and recommended reading if you're interested in this topic):Maryanne Cline Horowitz, 'Aristotle and Woman' Journal of the History of Biology, vol.9, no.2 (1976)Lesley Ann Dean-Jones, Women's Bodies in Classical Greek Science (Oxford, 1996)Ian Maclean, The Renaissance Notion of Woman: A Study in the Fortunes of Scholasticism and Medical Science in Europe (Cambridge, 1983)Cadden, Joan, Meanings of Sex Difference in the Middle Ages: Medicine, Science, andCulture (Cambridge, 1993)Canning, Kathleen, Gender History in Practice: Historical Perspectives on Bodies, Class,and Citizenship (Ithaca, 2006)Green, Monica, \u2018Gendering the History of Women\u2019s Healthcare\u2019, Gender and History,vol.20, no.3 (2008), pp.487-518.Green, Monica, Making Women\u2019s Medicine Masculine: The Rise of Male Authority in Pre-Modern Gynaecology (Oxford, 2008)Park, Katharine, \u2018Dissecting the Female Body: From Women\u2019s Secrets to the Secrets ofNature\u2019, in Seeff, Adele, and Donawerth, Jane, (eds.), Attending to Early Modern Women(London, 2000), pp.29-47.Park, Katharine, Secrets of women: gender, generation, and the origins of human dissection(New York, 2006)I did my dissertation on this exact topic, so feel free to PM me if you have any other questions :)", "label": 0}, {"content": "The medical field of gynecology has grown from a small specialty in the 19th century to a large and diverse field today.

They also ate squash and beans and sunflower seeds and certain grasses as well as gathered foods like blue and blackberries and walnuts and acorns. Most of what we know of the Mississippians comes from archaeology and archaeology cannot easily tell us directly how much protein vs carbs someone might have eaten, but it is a reasonable inference that if their society focused heavily on the cultivation of corn/maize, they would have eaten more carbohydrate heavy diets than other woodland cultures. [We do know from Archelogical evidence](_URL_2_)  (generally bones and remanants in trash piles) that the natives ate white tailed deer as a significant source of protein,  but that they also ate Rabbit, Muskrat, beaver, Raccoon, Turkey, and significant amounts of waterfowl, fish and amphibians.  So again, reasonable inference.   We can assume that an average Mississippian native might have eaten much of their daily calories from various foods with corn/maize in them, and eaten deer, duck, fish and turtles as major meat sources.    I don't think any estimates of impact on prey animals exist, or at least I'm not aware of any, but using modern methods we can make some educated guesses. In my home state, Arkansas, which was part of the Mississipian territory, the ecologists at the game and fish commission have determined that harvesting approximately 200,000 deer per year is necessary to keep the population at an optimal level.  [they keep track of harvest numbers and use the information to issue hunting permits](_URL_1_) less harvested than that, deer will begin to starve from overpopulation, more harvests, you don't have sustainable hunting.     Keep in mind, this is the deer population at current human settlement levels, but also with far less predator pressure than would have likely existed in the 10th century.  Give or take, assume an average white tailed deer will have about 55 pounds of lean meat.   That's about 40,000 calories.  This is actually very conservative because it is likely that natives would be using more of the animal resources than modern butchering practices.     I.e. they'd eat organ meats, use the bones to make stock, things many modern hunters would not bother with.  That's all extra calories. So if we assume that someone gets about half their calories from carbohydrate sources that's about 1000 calories per day that would need to come from proteins and fats.   One deer would be sufficient to provide protein for about 40 people for a day.   Edit: to clarify 1000 calories is a huge assumption, probably multiples higher than reality, but the lower the meat consumption, the lower the harvest numbers as well. To provide sufficient protein for 40,000 people, the Cahokians would have had to harvest about 1000 deer a day across their population area, and that would result in harvests of 300-400,000 deer per year.  Definitely enough to result in local depopulation.  If they got half their protein calories from Venison and the remainder from fish, turtles and ducks and small animals,  we take the deer harvest down to about 200,000 per year, about what we're doing at modern levels. Adding into this, waterfowl are a huge resource for Mississippi delta areas. Arkansas, again, allows hunters to harvest [close to 1 million ducks a year](_URL_3_) from migrating waterfowl.  Importantly,  ducks are migrating through in the winter, when other food might be difficult to obtain.     A fatty duck might feed 4-5 people for a day protein wise.  If they harvested even half modern levels, 500,000 ducks would feed the population for 40-50 days. Again, this is a level where over-harvesting is definitely possible but might also be sustainable. So all in all, when you consider that there were likely quite a few different sources of protein,  it's not too hard to figure out even how a city the size of Cahokia might have gathered enough wild protein to feed its population.", "label": 0}, {"content": "At its heyday, Cahokia was a city of 30,000 - 40,000 people and the Mississippians didn't have any domesticated livestock.

You must remember that the United States was not as \"connected\" as today (i.e., via the Internet and mobile phones), and many soldiers came from overwhelmingly rural backgrounds. The majority of farms did not yet have electricity, and these men would have had nothing to communicate with the outside world besides the mail (often obtained via General Delivery, R. F. D., or a Star Route), an occasional newspaper, potentially a radio, and the family car, if they had one. The only real way these men, as well as others, would have been able to interact with Roosevelt or discuss politics would have been what they had heard over the radio, from the paper, or from people in the nearest town, if they could spare any time away from their farm work; men in cities or nearer to Washington had more opportunities to discuss politics. Many men who followed politics only knew only Roosevelt for essentially their entire cognizant lives, as he had served over three terms (12 years, 1 month, and 8 days), and were greatly impacted by his death. Also similar to today, many men were just not that politically inclined, and did not follow him much or think much of his death. An article was published in *Yank, The Army Weekly*, in May 1945 which had several short interviews with soldiers around the world about how they felt when hearing of President Roosevelt's death: >  Before the news came over the radio from San Francisco, the GIs in the Eighth Army casual camp in the Philippines were talking mostly about the new adjusted-service-rating cards that two men, fresh from the States, had brought along with their service records and Form 20s. Then an infantryman back from morning chow said that the President had died from a heart attack. Another guy was positive that he had been killed in a plane accident on his way to Berlin to sign the peace treaty.  >  When they go the story straight and realized that it wasn't just another rumor, everybody in the camp was stunned and bewildered. >  Pvt. Howard McWatters of Nevada City, Calif., just released from the hospital and waiting to go back to the Americal Division, shook his head slowly. \"Roosevelt made a lot of mistakes,\" he said. \"But I think he did the best he could, and when he made mistakes he usually admitted it. Nobody could compare with him as President.\" >  Pfc. David Smith of Council Bluffs, Iowa, a railroad man in civilian life and a tank gunner in the Army, said, \"Now I suppose the Germans and Japs will think they'll get something weaker than unconditional surrender. I suppose they identified Roosevelt with our country so long that they think Roosevelt is America.\" >  There was more talk about the dead President and the new one. Somebody remarked that when you were in a casual camp in the Philippines, you were pretty far away from things. Then gradually the conversation swung back toward the adjusted-service-rating cards, and an argument started about the demobilization points. >  In Rome the Allied Command closed its places of amusement and the Italian officials shut down the civilian movies, the schools, the banks and the opera. \"I came out of my tent this morning,\" said Pfc. Fred Carlson of New York City, and the 1st Replacement Depot, \"and I saw the flag at half mast. I asked who was dead. Then they told me. I hope it won't work out like when we lost Wilson after the last war.\" >  Pvt. A. J. Smith of Naperville, Ill., an MP in Rome, was in the President's motorcycle escort when he visited Oran in 1943. \"I stood very close when he came down from the gangplank from the *Iowa*,\" he said. \"He looked tired and aged then.\" >  A Navy lifeguard spread the news among the GIs and sailors on Waikiki Beach in Honolulu. Most of them walked into the extensive Outrigger Club, which is ordinarily reserved for members only, and silently sat by the radio in their swim suits, listening to the reports of what had happened in Warm Springs. >  At Payne Field, the big ATC base near Cairo, Cpl. George Patcheck of Chicago was reading the story in the Middle East *Stars and Stripes* while he waited for the customers at the information desk in the terminal building. Cpl. O. H. Seals of Morristown, N. J., was looking over his shoulder. >  \"It happens to everybody,\" Seals said. \"The big ones, too.\" >  \"But he was an awful smart guy,\" Patcheck said. >  \"Sure,\" Seals said. \"But he's not the only smart guy. We've got others. Lots of them.\" >  Sgt. Bob Bowlsma was reading the final item of the 5 o'clock newscast in the Armed Forces Radio Service station in Panama when Cpl. Reuben Diaz, the station's Spanish announcer, handed him the flash. GIs hearing it at supper in the mess halls didn't believe it at first. Then the station's phone started to ring. Sgt. Jim Weathers would pick it up and say, \"Yes, it's true.\" \"Yes, it's true,\" he said to each call. \"Yes, it's true.\" >  In Sydney, Australia, Sgt. Lloyd P. Stallings of San Antonio, Tex., said, \"I came down here to have a good time, but now I don't feel so cheerful.\" >  Pvt. J. D. Cotter of the Australian Army said, \"Wish I knew more about this new bloke.\" >  Outside the Grand Hotel in Paris, Pfc. Lester Rebuck, a medic from the 104th Division, said: \"It was just like somebody socked me in the stomach when I wasn't looking. I just couldn't get it through my head that he was really dead.

Before the 20th century, the word (spelt \u201carap\u201d before the 19th century and \u201carab\u201d later) meant \u201cnaturally black-skinned, black-bodied man from hot (tropical) countries, especially Africa\u201d (according to Vladimir Dal\u2019s dictionary). A black-skinned servant was an exotic curiosity, a sign of extreme opulence, and having one was a fitting way for a Russian noble, especially the tsar, to demonstrate their riches.There are some accounts to that the mother of Mikhail Romanov, the founder of the dynasty, had black domestic servants back in 1610s, and both Tsar Alexis and his son Peter the Great had African servants as well, Abram Gannibal being the most famous of those servants. Some lesser nobles in the times of Peter the Great, having no way to obtain an actual black-skinned slave for a ball or party, would paint faces of their Slavic servants black. By the first quarter of the 18th century, the positions of \"Arabians of the Highest Court\" became ceremonial at the tsar's palace. While \"araps\" of earlier times were indeed slaves, bought from afar or sent as a gift, in the 19th century the positions of \"Arabians of the Highest Court\" were filled by free citizens of the Russian Empire, either born in Russia (and sometimes white) or coming from abroad. Foreign servants in the service of the tsar had to become citizens and baptised Eastern Orthodox. Some families managed to pass the position from father to son. The numbers of \"Arabians\" were't particularly high, 10 at the court of Catherine the Great, 20 in the early 19th century. By the end of 19th century, the Imperial court has only four offical \"Arabian\" positions: two Senior and two Junior. This didn't stop the court from hiring more black-skinned servants.\"Arabians\" weren't armed bodyguards but rather footmen or lackeys, mostly escorting the tsar or high-ranking guests around the palace, opening palace doors, doing small errands and generally looking fabulous. As Africans were coming to Russia through the Ottoman Empire, official dresses of \"Arabians of the Highest Court\" were reminiscent of Ottoman ones. These dresses were particularly lavish and expensive even by standards of the Russian Imperial court ([here's one from the collection of the State Hermitage](_URL_1_)). Court duties of \"Arabians\" included serving the hookah, considered an exotic \"oriental\" thing at the court. [This 1865 painting by Mih\u00e1ly Zichy shows an \"Arabian\" with a hookah](_URL_4_). The position was actually presigious and profitable, just like many of the Russian Imperial court offices: in addition to free housing, meals and official salary, \"Arabians\" would receive medals, awards and gift money at any state occasion.Nina Tarasova retells the biographies of several \"Arabians\" at the court of Nicholas II. [Konstantin Apti](_URL_5_), born in Smyrna (modern Izmir in Turkey), entered into service of Duke Alexander Petrovich of Oldenburg in 1882 as a \"St. Petersburg commoner\" of Eastern Orthodox faith, and later served from 1890 to 1917 at the court of Emperors Alexander III and Nicholas II. He was decorated by multiple awards of Bulgaria, Serbia, Germany, France, Siam and the Emirate of Bukhara, and the title of \"personal honorary citizen\". In January 1918, he was retired by order of the People's Comissariat of Property disbanding the old Section of the Marshal of the Court and granted a small pension. His son Nikolai served as a \"Junior Arabian\" since 1911 and was dismissed and joined the Imperial Russian Army to fight in WWI in 1914. Another \"Arabian\", Jorge Mari\u00e1, baptised [Georgy Nikolaevich Mari\u00e1](_URL_3_), was a \"negro Portuguese subject from Cape Verde\". Jorge Mari\u00e1 came to Russia in the age of twenty to enter into service of the Imperial Court. In 1883, he married a Russian woman named Yekaterina Lapshina with a permission of the Section of the Marshal of the Court (most peculiar, they had to seek such permission not because of *his* race but because of *her* origin: any fianc\u00e9e of an Imperial servant had to be checked for loyalty). He was awarded the title of \"personal honorary citizen\" as well; Yekaterina and five of his children kept the apartment and a pension after Georgy's death in 1912. His son Sergey Mari\u00e1 also served as a \"Junior Arabian of the Highest Court\" from 1913 to 1917; all five of Georgy's children remained in Russia after the Revolution of 1917; two of them served in the Red Army during WWII, and the daughter Yekaterina survived the siege of Leningrad.

Chroniclers from one end of Eurasia to the other record staggering death totals, the impossible numbers aiming for emphasis rather than accuracy. When Europeans sacked a city, it rebuilt its walls to be stronger the next time. When the Mongols sacked Samarkand, the survivors gave up and built a new city next to the ruins; when the Mongols sacked Otrar and Nishapur, they were never rebuilt at all. Sichuan province in China counted 2,500,000 households in its 1228 tax registration; in 1282, the Yuan dynasty's first census tallied only 500,000. The population loss across from Kiev to China was so precipitous and so slow to recover that the reforestation of newly empty land *lowered atmospheric CO2*.An obvious reason for the scale of devastation of human lives was simply the size of the imperial conquest--swallowing nearly ten million square miles and countless peoples, polities, and empires. But smaller conquests, even by nomadic warriors like the initial Turks in the Near East, did not have a to-scale destructive impact. Historians have pointed to a number of factors contributing to the Mongols having the opportunity to exercise their ruthlessness so widely.**Experience**Steppe nomads like the Mongols didn't life in self-sufficient isolation; they traded and raided on the fringes of sedentary society. As John Fletcher argues, this meant they benefited from weak governments that \"let\" them get away with more. Stronger, more stable governments could muster up resistance or defense--which, rather than keeping the Mongols away, made them *fight* for what they wanted instead of negotiating or quietly stealing. Generations of this helped build a *skilled* warrior culture with knowledge of tactics against a strong government. And in their conquests, \"strength\" was not always a quality of their targets.**Drafting**One of the Mongols' most notable features was the forced incorporation of conquered peoples not just into an empire, but into the imperial army. New soldiers from places that had resisted would be dispersed to different thousands to prevent revolts, but serve the Mongols they still would. A solid top-down command hierarchy helped enforce standards at combat and strategic levels. And those who could not serve in the military might nevertheless serve military purposes. If they were lucky, they were the Chinese artisans instructing and constructing siege engines and incendiary artillery. If they were unlucky, they were prisoners-of-war brought to Urgench and Samarkand, and forced to haul stones underneath hails of defenders' arrows to the ditches around the city--with their bodies being just as useful to the Mongols for filling in the moat.**Tactics**The Mongols were excellent as individual soldiers and excellent as an army. One of their most notable features was a stunning success rate at triumphing over besieged cities--in the Near East and Europe, generally considered a rather difficult task. Sometimes this came through trickery--approaching the city at first in small parties, basically pretending to be the medieval equivalent of cattle rustlers squirreling away with a city's herds...only to draw pursuers, group by group, into a death trap. Other times, with the \"aid\" of prisoners-of-war as human shields, they simply drove directly at city walls to scale them. Siege technology acquired from China, as mentioned earlier, was used as well, but it doesn't seem to have been the crux of Mongol strategy.**Speed**This is the most interesting factor to me, because it helps explain how the utterly ruthless conquering Mongols could transform into *rulers*. In contrast to the example of the Turks I used above, Mongol expansion under Genghis Khan was *lightspeed*. Fletcher and David Morgan have argued that the Mongols adapted to the demands and cost/benefit analyses of urban/sedentary civilization...but this is a process that understandably takes time, and the devastating initial conquests were all over by then. So mores like \"leave the city intact because it's good for your trading network\" and \"peasants are useful as farmers to supply the battalion you have staged at the fortress with food\" were not yet developed as the Mongols stormed through Persia, China, Ruthenia. They were used to their old world divided into \"plunder\" and \"obstacles to plunder.\"**What About Numbers?**Now, the question of statistics has also come up, and I've even offered one set in the introduction--the disappearance of *two million* households from the tax registration in Sichuan. But that already should give some pause before we rubber-stamp murdered by Mongols. We know from Central Asian chroniclers that the advancing Mongols produced hordes of very un-golden refugees--some fleeing in advance, some escaping with their lives. Perhaps this was also the case for some of those people. Or disease, or deportation (another strategy of the Mongols as rulers), or *it's the Middle Ages and numbers are weird.*But medieval demographics being what they are--an estimate at *best*, and usually more like a guess--I wouldn't want to put a number on any death toll, and I don't see Fletcher, Morgan, Hugh Kennedy, Peter Jackson, Thomas Allsen, etc. going anywhere near one. In the end, it doesn't really tell us anything we don't already know about the Mongol conquest. And with the Mongols, we don't have modern political needs like the calculation of reparations owed by a still-extant government to the remnant nations they tried to obliterate, or an insistence against nationalists/white supremacists that a particular genocide occurred. Instead, we can tally up the awe-inspiring reach of the Mongol war machine--people *on horseback, armed with arrows* ravaging from Hungary to Acre to China. And we can read the terror in their targets' chronicles and letters through the endless tallying of atrocities real and rumored--catapulting the bodies of pestilence victims into the city walls to sicken and kill everyone left alive; rolling up a ruler in carpet and trampling him to death; wiping out entire cities because one general's son happened to be killed in battle; executing all the male inhabitants of Balkh to terrify Merv into surrendering without a fight...only to kill its women and children along with the men.That, in the end, is a more useful metric of the Mongols' impact than a guesswork forty million or any figure. And it's far more fruitful as a basis to study why on Earth this monstrous, unstoppable behemoth was so heavily courted by Christians and Muslims as a potential ally, and how settled Mongol rule could eventually be such an important catalyst of intercontinental trade and travel.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Mongol conquests under Genghis Khan were a series of conquests that took place in the 12th and 13th centuries.

Claiming to ultimately hail from Egypt or \"little Egypt\" (hence the English corruption \"gypsy\"), in some towns and countries some of them presented a 'letter of passage' purportedly from Emperor Sigismund granting them the right to steal (!). The importance here being, he was also then the king of *Bohemia*, at least in name. (15th century Bohemia kinda loses the Hussite Wars and then kinda proceeds to act like it won them...It's Complicated.)Unfortunately, I'm not firsthand-familiar with the medieval French sources, so I can't tell you if the appellation itself goes that far back; Aimee Kilbane cites it from a 1724 history of Paris so it's almost certainly a good deal older.Kilbane also hypothesizes that already when Sauval used it, *boh\u00e9mien* was already starting to take on metaphorical connotations related to stereotypes of the \"Gypsy\" life (as I will hence call it, following scholarship). However, for its alignment with artists living our *la vie boheme*, we have to turn to the 19th century.In the early 19th century, the artists and poets of the Romantic movement cultivated an image of themselves as outsider-insiders--living separate and exotic lives but firmly within modern Western civilization, here namely Paris. Victor Hugo's secondary protagonist of *Notre-Dame de Paris*, note, is a writer enamored with a Gypsy woman. (Hugo is on record as saying the real central character is the cathedral). Just a few years after Hugo produced the source material for [the most brilliant song in the Disney canon](_URL_0_), in 1834, a French encyclopedist used boh\u00e9mien outright to describe the artist community of Paris.This is relevant to hippies in the 1960s, I promise.Kilbane stresses the idea of \"noncomformity\" at the root of 19th century artists' and writers' adoption of the term bohemian. Looking deeper into the ethnic stereotype as well as 19th century poets' use of the term, however, other scholars sketch out how bohemian/Gypsy becomes a white Western European shorthand for the raw/primal/Nature aspect of humans. As Philip Landon puts it, using \"Gypsy\" to refer to the literary stereotype: >  Idealized, the Gypsy is an innocent child of the universe leading acarefree life under the open sky, a living symbol of freedom in nature.Vilified, the same Gypsy becomes a primitive who has failed to rise outof nature: a lying, thieving, dirty, work-shy, promiscuous savage whoabducts children and even engages in cannibalism. Both caricaturesidentify Gypsies with nature, conceived as a realm of antisocial self-interest irrevocably at odds with civilization.Landon shows how 19th century poets would call their work \"The Gypsy Scholar\" and such, without having any either stereotyped Gypsies or actual Roma figures in the poem--that's how strong this impression of the Gypsy/\"bohemian\" already was.But obviously there are no hippies in 1834, and not even in 1896 with the premiere of Puccini's *La Boheme*. What there are, however, are hippies in the 1960s and 1970s--which coincided with an upsurge in western Europe of Travelers, and especially of migration of Roma into the west and Italy in particular.White hippies and the Roma shared a lifestyle and purposeful construction/maintenance of an identity separate from mainstream Western culture--and the hippies were aligned even more closely with the Gypsy stereotype than they were actual Roma. [Freewheeling sexuality, singing and dancing, distinctive dress, *spectacle* for the sake of spectacle...](_URL_1_)Hippies adopted less the \"artist\" part of the bohemien stereotype, and rather more the outsider/primal/spectacle end of things. However, the stereotype of the \"bohemian artist\" definitely kept the linking of the terms alive during the 19th and 20th centuries.", "label": 0}, {"content": "Bohemia (a former kingdom) became associated with the style of hippies in the 1960s.

The typical image invoked is the village small enough that everyone knows everyone else's business. But that's still a fairly recent view.Rewinding to the Middle Ages, we meet a concept called *fama*. This is a Latin word that means reputation or word on the street or rumor, some combination of those--and in medieval courts, *fama* was a legal principle with concrete implications.Bad *fama* was used to discredit witnesses or reject their testimony altogether. According to 13th century French legal texts, in a lawsuit between someone with *bonne renomee* and someone with *mals renome*, the first person would receive the benefit of the doubt automatically. In some cases, bad *fama* would cause a person's lawsuit to be dismissed out of hand, or permit them to push for charges of fraud. F. R. P. Akehurst citing civil jurist Philippe de Beaumanoir gives this exemplum of the power of *fama*--and who had control over it: >  An innkeeper with a good reputation could avoid charges of having stolen property from his guests, but if his reputation were not very good he would be the most likely suspect, even if there were signs of forced entry and broken chests. In such a case, the reputation of the innkeeper would be determined by a judicial inquiry.  >  The only kind of evidence such an inquiry would turn up would be oral: what people *said* about a person could make or break him. The inquiry also delved into what other people thought of a person, what they remembered of him.While Beaumanoir is writing a prescriptive text, Akehurst compares the procedures listed favorably in terms of reflecting contemporary practice. So we should take seriously what Beaumanoir is saying here: forensic or physical evidence did not determine the case; other people's opinions of a person close to the crime did. Gossip made reality.There is also, for the late Middle Ages into the early modern era, the question of the sacrament of confession. This has a vast and contentious historiography, so in advance, I want to be clear that we have to distinguish between \"the population at large\" and \"some individuals here and there\"--that is, not everyone has the same experience or depth of exposure/intensity/care.In 1215, the Fourth Lateran Council very famously (well, okay, very famously to medievalists, which is not really very famously at all) decreed that all Christians of both sexes must confess their sins to their parish priest once a year. The actual point wasn't confession itself, of course--it was that lay Christians must receive the Eucharist once a year, and confession was necessary to cleanse one's soul before what was central enough to be just called \"the sacrament.\"In practice, however, the confession-Eucharist connection amounted to a strong focus on *both* sacraments in religious instruction: the Eucharist, that it was the genuine body and blood of Christ and reception was necessary for salvation; confession, what sins were and what was moral behavior and the necessary contrition-confession-penance triad. Oh, yeah, and that really you needed to confess to a priest and receive sacramental absolution; just shouting at the sky was insufficient for salvation purposes.Now, this doesn't mean that in 1216, every Christian in the medieval West was confessing their sins on Palm Sunday *just like that*. However, participation ramped up over time; by the fifteenth century there were dioceses mandating confession more than once a year, and others reporting it was offered more frequently to certain groups (\"women and students\" being my favorite example). Medievalists have absolutely called confession an attempted tool for social control or discipline. It's not an accident that even into the 15th century, German-language (not Latin!) texts on awareness and avoidance of sin divide wrath into murder, war, and arson--these are real issues people struggle with. And as Pierre Payer pointed out, instructional manuals for *confessors* focus on sexual sins at a rate from twice as often as anger and greed (Robert Grossteste) to seventy-six times as often (Robert of Sorbon, *we know who you are in the dark*). The Church had long made the definition of marriage and attempt to control sex a centerpiece of its play for power over the Church on Earth to make sure it became the Church in heaven as well.So looking at late medieval guides to confession, for priests and for lay people alike, scholars like Steven Ozment and Jean Delumeau argue for the late Middle Ages as a period of immense social anxiety over confession, over having to scrutinize every inch of your soul for every possible sin lest you miss a tiny thing that punts you to purgatory or even hell. The problem is, to this end they cite almost exclusively post-Reformation Protestants, *especially* Martin Luther. A significant chunk of whose theological game was that terror over confession and penance and never being good enough was part of the spiritual crisis and temptation of the devil that pushed him towards the 'breakthrough'. These are, in other words, absolutely not objective accounts.Looking at medieval sources, we find a much more diverse picture. Standards for behavior/recognition of one's sins to the point of emotional self-mutilation became a hagiographical trope for women \"living saints\" like Dorothea von Montau and Elisabeth Achler. They're confessing every day, confessing every sin of their childhood over and over, etc etc. And usually their hagiographer (also their confessor) is noting that these women should be examples of spiritual excellence, NOT role models to follow. There is also evidence from 15th and 16th century sermons that some theologian-priests were preaching that the *desire* to be saved, along with the sacraments, was enough even if one couldn't live up to behavioral standards. Unfortunately, we can't do what we really want, which is to get down in a confession session between a priest and penitent and find out what confessors *actually* demanded. Did they scroll down the list of Latin questions about sins and translate to the vernacular on the fly? (These include things like \"did you kill anyone\" to \"did you throw snowballs at someone passing by your house\") Were they \"one and done\"-ing assembly line offering services? Of course, there was probably a variety of severity...and by the 15th century, lay people were gradually winning the right to choose their own confessors.Which brings us, in fact, back to *fama*.Confession today brings up mental images of \"the confessional,\" the closed little *private* box, hushed voices. The confessional is an early modern invention. While priests were required to keep the so-called seal of the confessional, the actual practice of it would be the penitent standing next to the priest with a long line of their neighbors standing right there--easily in a position to overhear, popular literature attests.I've illustrated, I think, the immense difficulty of securing emotional (not necessarily physical) privacy in the later Middle Ages, far beyond 'nosy neighbor' nostalgia for early 20th century Main Street, USA or 19th century prairie towns. I've also shown that people reacted with different intensity to aspects of this culture. That's not to say anything about 'mental illness' at all, you understand; I just want to start by breaking down a monolithic medieval Christian society in terms of responses to what we might see as \"popular surveillance.\"I am in general going to let the psychologists talk about schizophrenia and its history as a disorder, but I want to make a few remarks on how historians approach neuropsychiatric disorders. A lot of things about the Middle Ages scream \"superstition!\" to us today--fear of the devil, belief in mystical visions can easily read as delusions and paranoia. We need to distinguish what was quite normal to most medieval people from what can read as sliding into paranoia today.", "label": 0}, {"content": "Paranoid schizophrenia is a mental disorder that causes people to have irrational fears and suspicions about the world around them.

People with paranoid schizophrenia may also have a fear of being spied on by their own neighbors.", "label": 1}, {"content": "Indeed, in its usage in the 18th and early 19th centuries, the term was used in much the same way as you mentioned - a neutral or even positive descriptor (another example might be \"Spaniard.\")  It was frequently given in the early 19th century by immigration officials who either received no adequate response to their inquiries for the immigrants' names, or simply could understand what they were told - and as such would frequently list them as *chinaman/chinawoman,* or *Chinese*. At times ethnically Chinese would even self-refer as \"Chinamen,\" as in a letter from Norman Asing, a Chinese restaurant owner and community leader in San Francisco to the then governor of California, John Bigler in 1852 regarding the proposed immigration restrictions.  Asing wrote: >  To His Excellency Gov. Bigler > Sir: I am a Chinaman, a republican, and a lover of free institutions; am much attached to the principles of the government of the United States, and therefore take the liberty of addressing you as the chief of the government of this State.So, when did that semantic shift - from *Chinaman* being a neutral or even positive descriptor and even self-applied demonym - to it becoming a derogatory, racist term?  There are, of course, several factors - some internal to the East Asian experience in the US, and some involving China itself.  We'll look at both, in turn.In terms of the term's usage in America and Europe, we can see - to no one's great surprise - that Euro-Americans were not terribly picky about which Asian people to whom they applied the term *chinaman*.  Chinese, sure, but also Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese.  If the \"face was yellow\", they were equally Chinamen in the eyes of the majority of Americans and Europeans.  This is well demonstrated by the \"nickname\" for the future Japanese Grand Admiral, and subsequently dubbed in the West as the \"Nelson of the East,\" Togo Heihachiro (\u6771\u90f7 \u5e73\u516b\u90ce) given by his British shipmates during his training in Britain, who called him *\"Johnny Chinaman.\"*  Given the even by then longstanding national antipathy between Qing China and Meiji Japan, it's unsurprising that such a \"nickname\" led the young Togo, on more than one occasion to \"put an end to it by blows.\"  Likewise, the obviously flippant and over-broad label swiftly came to be regarded by the Chinese as a dismissal by the white man of their unique culture and nationality, since it was obvious that they meant \"all East Asians\" when they said \"Chinamen\" ... in marked contrast to when they referred to Frenchmen or Dutchmen.One of the cementing factors over the course of the 19th century leading to the term becoming derogatory rather than neutral, though, was the attitude by Americans as a whole regarding Chinese and East Asian in general immigration.  The so-called \"Yellow Peril\" era - a phrase coined, by the by, in 1895 by the German Kaiser Wilhelm II - that codified the already rising fear among Europeans and Americans both that \"The Orientals\" were dangerous and potentially destabilizing to their world order.  That fear was easily given legs in 1905 by the victory of the Japanese over the Russian Tsar in the Ruso-Japanese War - seemingly proving that \"The Orientals\" posed a significant military threat to the Western Powers and must be appropriate dealt with.  That, of course, was not the beginning of the *Yellow Peril,* only the birth of the term itself.  The actual sentiment, as we saw in Asing's letter to the Governor of California, went back decades earlier.  To quote again from Asing's 1852 open letter: > You are deeply convinced you say \u201cthat to enhance the prosperity and preserve the tranquility of this State, Asiatic immigration must be checked.\u201d This, your Excellency, is but one step towards a retrograde movement of the government, [...]  You argue that this is a republic of a particular race\u2014that the Constitution of the United States admits of no asylum to any other than the pale face. This proposition is false in the extreme, and you know it.  > [...] we would beg to remind you that when your nation was a wilderness, and the nation from which you sprung barbarous, we exercised most of the arts and virtues of civilized life; that we are possessed of a language and a literature, and that men skilled in science and the arts are numerous among us; that the productions of our manufactories, our sail, and workshops, form no small share of the commerce of the world; [...] And we beg to remark, that so far as the history of our race in California goes, it stamps with the test of truth the fact that we are not the degraded race you would make us.

In a particularly virulent piece in the early 1870's - leading up to the Chinese Massacre of 1871 in Los Angeles - editor of the *New York Tribune* and famed orator of the era Horace Greely intoned, \"The Chinese are uncivilized, unclean, and filthy beyond all conception, without any of the higher domestic or social relations; lustful and sensual in their dispositions; every female is a prostitute of the basest order.\"  In the face of such xenophobia, the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed and enacted in 1882, and would remain on the books and at least partially enforced until 1943, when it was finally repealed (though it was superceded by the just-as-bad Immigration Act of 1924, which outright banned immigration from all Asian countries until 1965 when it was struck down and replaced by the Immigration and Nationality Act.)The overthrow of the Qing Dynasty and the establishment of the Republic of China in 1912 likely also set in motion a further drive to \"do away with\" the old exonyms, much as it did re: Sino-Japanese relations.  One of the (relatively minor, but still important) sticking points between China and Japan over the 2nd through 4th decades of the 20th century was what Japan was going to call this new, non-imperial Chinese Republic.  Briefly, the old Japanese name for China - \u652f\u90a3 (Shina) - came to be regarded by the RoC by the late 30\u2019s as not just archaic but an outright insult and epithet \u2013 by referring to China by its \u201cold\u201d name, that was understood to imply its antiquity and obsolescence.  As brought up by /u/CaptainPyjamaShark, we might think of the Japanese insistence on calling China and the Chinese \u652f\u90a3\u4eba, \"Sina-man\" (or as it morphed into by the late 30's and the 2nd Sino-Japanese War, \u652f\u90a3\u732a ... \"Sina-pig\")... as similar to \"Chinaman\" and probably even more so the term \"Celestial\" in English - a hearkening back to the period of foreign Qing rule, when the Chinese were Qing Dynasty Slaves (\u6e05\u56fd\u5974)... i.e. \"Servants of the Great Celestial Qing\" *(Note: a pejorative exonym, not an endonym, because apparently that needed to be spelled out)*.  One can imagine why the citizens of the Republic of China would not have been so happy about continually being referred to as such in either Japanese or English, especially when it had been so mis-applied and jumped on by whites as yet another epithet.  From Chuimei Ho, \"the usage quickly became pejorative when readers interpreted it as meaning that Chinese, absurdly in view of their obviously inferior economic and legal status, considered themselves to be superior to ordinary humans.  Calling a mere laundryman 'celestial' was an irony that even the least educated anti-Chinese white hoodlum could understand. So it rapidly became an insult for some.\"Asing, Norman (1852).

To start this picture, we can look back on several past answers I've written for previous questions.* [Is there a recognized \"Native American\" philosophy, similar to how Western thought and Eastern thought is generalized?](_URL_3_)This answer explains that for Indigenous Peoples, we most certainly had our own understandings of philosophy and what it meant to lead a good life. This will ultimately differ from Tribe to Tribe, but it provides a foundation for understanding that while Tribes certainly do not reinforce the \"Noble Savage\" myth,^1 which is essentially what your question is getting at, there was intellectual thought and reasoning behind model conduct that individuals of Tribes were to maintain for their collective identity.* [Was sovereignty a part of Native American political thought?](_URL_2_)In a similar matter, I discuss here how politics was also a very ingrained concept for many Indigenous Peoples. This is to say that life was not really \"simple\" in the sense that people just ate, hunted, and slept. Nations were maintained and doing so often required high levels of organization and structure in order to logistically provide for these needs and protect their land holdings.* [Were Native North Americans egalitarian?](_URL_1_)This answer probably has the most applicability to your question. It describes that for many Tribes, particularly my own, society overall was more egalitarian, which I think many exaggerate for being \"idyllic,\" though I also wouldn't say that isn't too far from the truth.There are two major areas we can look at to further inform our conclusion on this matter, to access if Tribes were \"idyllic,\" or at least if they happened to be different enough that we can see varying degrees of overall prosperity. These are culture and practicality. For the first, the last link addresses this: > What often determined how egalitarian a society was is the societal structure and resources. Many Native American communities were hunter-gatherer societies. Some were farmers. Some had a combination. However, most were communal. This caused them to have a more egalitarian society than what we see today because the \"wealth,\" so to speak, was distributed more evenly because life was organized around kinship ties and reciprocity for the well being of the whole community. This lifestyle was rooted in both cultural value as well as economic value. > In terms of cultural value, sharing, gift-giving, and trading were all highly valued because what was given was expected to be repaid in some way later in the future (hence the \"reciprocity\"). This was because resources were often limited and the gaining of resources required community effort, more than what one person could provide. > This leads into what we could consider the economic value. Because many hunter-gatherers were nomadic or semi-nomadic, they were not able to keep vast reserves of food on hand. They needed to carry what they needed. This means that they could not sustain a population beyond a certain size. Thus, many native societies were balanced in number of births and deaths. And when there isn't a surplus of food, you are more dependent on others of your community who have also gathered enough food. This indicates that not one person was in charge of all the food. It was all shared and \"owned\" by the community. Unlike in agricultural and industrial societies, structures where mass production of resources can be carried out by a few, hunter-gatherers had to share everything in order for everyone to survive. This meant that resources, particularly food and shelter, were distributed equally. Individual wealth and prestige might differ, but not so much as to offset the balance of the society.Beyond this, let's examine some key areas to better inform this position.##GovernmentOne of the most well known examples of Indigenous Government that existed prior to the United States and even colonization by European powers is that of the the Haudenosaunee, or the Iroquois Confederacy. The origin stories of their own nations give a glimpse into the social environment it was born out of and also exemplify Indigenous values that standards of the Old Ways were based off, though they were not always followed. > The Haudenosaunee ... are an ancient people of North America. Our tradition states that our people originated in the northwestern woodlands of North America ... Our existence in these lands has not been one of absolute peace and tranquility. We have had to work hard to develop the civilization we enjoy. There was a time when or lands were torn by conflict and death. There were times when certain individuals attempted to establish themselves as rulers of the people through exploitation and repression. > We emerged from those times to establish a strong democratic and spiritual Way of Life. The confederate state of the Haudenosaunee became the embodiment of democratic principles that continue to guide our peoples today. The Haudenosaunee became the first \"United Nations,\" established on a firm foundation of peace, harmony and respect. > Within the Haudenosaunee, all member nations are equal, regardless of size. Within their national territories the member nations are autonomous, but all adhere to the central principles of democracy that we agreed to at the formation of the Confederacy (Akwesasne Notes, 2005, p. 26). . . > All of this political activity is set in the roots of an ancient tradition of the spirituality of our peoples. This cosmology places the Haudenosaunee in a balanced, familiar relationship with the universe and the Earth ... This philosophy taught us to treat the Natural World with great care. Our institutions, practices, and technologies were developed with a careful eye to their potential for disturbing the delicate balance in which we live (p. 27).The Haudenosaunee explain here that for them, before the formation of their government, they experienced many of the same problems we encountered after colonization and into our modern day. Wars, fighting, killings, and injustice did exist in various forms. These were carried out at times by Natives against Natives. **However...** The occurrence of these actions are regularly filtered through a Western lens. As the Haudenosaunee describe, they, as a people, were not governed by carnal instincts that put them at odds with others and with the Natural World. Rather, they sought to cooperate with their environment, recognizing their role in it and the balance they should maintain.When forming their government, they based it off what would become known as The Great Law of Peace. This law, which is their constitution, provided the model conduct for their citizens to emulate. This law was provided by a man called the Peacemaker. > The first principle that the Peacemaker set forth was indisputable to those who heard his words. He said that it has come to pass that in this land humans beings are seen to abuse on another ... From that initial explanation--that the Giver of Life (later addressed as the Great Creator) did not intend that human beings abuse one another--he proposed that human societies must form governments that will serve to prevent the abuse of human beings by other human beings and that will ensure peace among nations and peoples (p. 32). . . > Peace was to be defined not as the simple absence of war or strife, but as the active striving of humans for the purpose of establishing universal justice. Peace was defined as the product of a society that strives to establish concepts that correlate to the English words power, reason, and righteousness (p. 33).Here, we see a good blend of practicality *and* Culture. In order to sustain the very principles of their society, they needed to conduct themselves in accordance with this law. It is important to note that this law was not written down. It is an Oral Tradition that is [enforced by internalization of the law,](_URL_0_) which fosters a strong constitution in individuals of their nation. This observance is what was noticed by the colonial powers and their misunderstandings led them to conclude that their primitiveness is what resulted in their supposed nobility rather than a complex spiritual and philosophical lifestyle in which their society was dependent upon. This, of course, was encouraged due to their collective nature. They worked more on a collectivist mentality rather than an individualistic one, the latter being more common in the Western World today and which is the lens many non-Indigenous researchers regularly peer through. Their collectivistic nature is then demonstrated in the rights established for citizens of their nation: all leaders are elected democratically, councils have the power to nominate and advise elections, all citizens have full rights, all citizens can travel freely, women had all the rights as men (women even were in charged of selecting leaders), immigrants were provided protection for under their laws, individual nations of the Confederacy maintained their autonomy though separate national boundaries had been abolished. For individual internalizing this law, it can be summed up in this phrase: > A society was socialized to the ideology that, if an injustice occurs, it is their moral duty to defend the oppressed again their oppressors (p. 38).", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Native Americans in what is now the USA have often been portrayed as having \"idyllic\" lives before Western colonizers arrived - is there any truth to this?

Originally, the existing laws against homosexual activity which had existed under the Tsarist regime were repealed when the Bolsheviks abolished the entire Tsarist legal code in 1917 - it was a small part of a massive change in policy, as the new Soviet legal code was brought in to replace the old one. This new code omitted any mention of homosexuality.So it's perhaps less that the Soviets deliberately decriminalised same sex relations, and more of a case that the lifting of prohibition might be called \"collateral damage\", not necessarily fully intentional, and certainly not necessarily supported by the new government. Indeed, the lifting of prohibition only applied in the Russian and Ukrainian SSRs, and homosexual activity remained a crime in other parts of the USSR. It's easy to see how issues like LGBT rights could have been forgotten about during such a period of political turmoil - after all, if you're a communist revolutionary primarily concerned with fighting an incredibly bloody civil war against the previous regime, and establishing a radical new economic order in the wake of that struggle, the question of gay rights isn't going to be at the top of your agenda.However, this isn't a black and white subject. It's certainly not true to suggest that there was *no support* for LGBT rights in the burgeoning Soviet Union, and while the legalisation appears somewhat inadvertent and not-fully-intentional, there was also significant debate within the party on the matter of homosexuality. The fact that anti-LGBT laws were omitted from the new law code shows this; in a time when most of the world wouldn't even consider legalising what they saw as a mental illness, it cannot be purely an accident that the radical Soviet government chose not to mention the topic in their new law code. Soviet LGBT policy was mixed; often, it was seen as a mental illness, typical for the time. But there's also a fair amount of support from Soviet lawmakers for gay rights. Some viewed this as part of their revolution; the liberation of working peoples was, of course, to include sexual liberation. Considering the history of Russia, this shouldn't come as too much of a surprise; criminalisation of homosexuality by the Tsarist regime was largely orchestrated as part of \"westernisation\", trying to modernise the Russian state by adopting western methods and values. Before this, the oppression of LGBT minorities in Russia had not been particularly prevalent, and certainly was not state-sanctioned.Interestingly, others in the Communist Party viewed homosexuality as a consequence of capitalism, and \"bourgeois moral degeneracy\". It's important to realise that communist politics are just as varied as those found in modern capitalist liberal democracies, and \"communism\" is not a single ideological bloc in any sense (this view of communism is often portrayed, especially in propaganda against it).More evidence of genuine attempts at sexual liberation in the USSR are found in the fact that openly homosexual people held major public offices during the 1920s in the USSR. Georgy Chicherin was People's Commisar for Foreign Relations of the USSR from 1923 to 1930, as an openly gay man.Nevertheless, this period of radical policy (by which I mean, policy which was percieved at the time as radical by most of the world) eventually had to come to an end. While the government was often at odds with itself over this matter, the public was largely indifferent or opposed to LGBT rights, and this began to show with social backlash against these rights. Towards the end of the 1920s, homosexuality was once more officially labelled a mental disorder. It was downhill from there.In 1933, in Stalin's USSR, the government once more criminalised homosexual activity - although this time explicitly only mentioning *male* homosexuality as a crime. This was an offence which resulted in internment within prison camps. There are a few historical views on this; for one, Stalin was looking to build public support for himself (believe it or not, dictators often enjoy strong support from their people and have a big interest in maintaining that), and criminalising homosexuality was not unpopular amongst the public. Furthermore, this was also yet another crime which he could use to accuse high ranking figures within the government who he didn't like, and hence send them away to a prison camp. Finally, rather interestingly, homosexuality was also portrayed by Soviet propaganda of the time as being favoured by fascists; this was, of course, nothing but a lie, as the Nazis were at the time themselves putting homosexuals in prison camps.

There are also vocabulary differences, so you can even think of it as a \"gay dialect\"... or, rather, a \"gay sociolect,\" since it's not tied to a geographical area.  Most speakers are able to \"code switch\" - in essence, they can turn it on and off.  It's a marker of identity.  Lots of cultural groups have sociolects that they use to show membership in a group - think of BEV (Black English Vernacular aka Ebonics), or \"Valley Girl\" speech, or the l337speak used online.As far as history, some linguists say that the gay accent was influenced by the California accent, since California was the heart of the early gay rights movement in the US.

Polari actually sounds a bit like what we'd call a \"gay accent\" today, and it has its roots in a combination of Roma argot, Cockney rhymbing slang, and exaggerated, singsong theatrical speech (think the old Punch and Judy puppet shows).  Polari almost completely died out in the 1960s and 70s, though, as it started to be seen as a negative stereotype.

The French had declared Paris an open city, meaning that no defense was offered on part of the French there in order to not reduce the city into ruins. With the advance guard approaching the center, German troops entered the city and had military vehicles with loudspeakers (most likely borrowed from the Wehrmacht Propaganda Companies) drive through the city instructing the citizens to stay in-doors.The Guardian cites [an Associated Press correspondent describing the city before the German arrival](_URL_0_): >  It was a strangely empty Paris that awaited the arrival of the Germans. The scene is described by a Press Association correspondent who left the city late on Thursday. Only a few police were to be seen in the streets. A handful of soldiers and some civilians wandered about aimlessly. Some housewives were doing their shopping at the only baker's shop still open in the West End. A mobile guard was posted at the door of the shop, a gun slung over his shoulder. There was no sound of gunfire or of exploding bombs. >  >  The only authorities left in the capital were Cardinal Suhad, the Archbishop, officials of the essential services, and the Prefecture, Mobile Guards, and firemen. All bridges had been left intact, but the French are reported to have blown up the big armaments factories in the suburbs. >  >  The main German forces entered the city at noon yesterday. They came from the north-west and by the Aubervilliers Gate from the north-east. From the north-western suburbs they marched through the west end down the Champs Elys\u00e9es - tanks, armoured reconnaissance cars, anti-tank units, and motorised infantry. Machine-gun posts were set up at important points, and the wireless stations were seized. >   >  The people left in Paris watched the entry in silence, reports the Associated Press correspondents. Small groups of people still sat along the terraces and boulevards and in the caf\u00e9s. Shops were boarded up. In the Place de l'Op\u00e9ra stood a solitary motor-car with a big \"for sale\" sign. The Paris police still patrolled the streets. Occasionally could be heard the drone of an unmolested 'plane.The loudspeaker vehicles with instructions to citizens are also decried in various books, from John Williams' *The Ides of May: The Defeat of France, May-June 1940* to Herbert R. Lottman's *The Fall of Paris: June 1940*.The Gestapo (although in Casblanca there is the possibility that as was common at the time, that Rick refers to the Geheime Feldpolizei, the Gestapo-esque units in the Wehrmacht) did not arrive in the city immediately with the combat troops but took a couple of days until they had established themselves. In the logistical chaos of taking over a city, it is not really possible exactly when they arrive in full strength in Paris but we know that they were there on June 30, 1940 when the first Gestapo agents started to inspect bank vaults in the Paris capital for gold to plunder for the German war economy.However, the first Gestapo agents as part of the German Sonderkommando, a troop of about 20 Gestapo agents operating independently, arrived in the city together with the troops on June 1940 and established themselves in the Hotel du Louvre. They brought with them arrest lists containing the names of prominent enemies of Germany, communists, socialists, prominent Jews, and government representatives that the Germans wanted to arrest right away and started this campaign in close cooperation with the Wehrmacht commanders on site. But the fact that this Sonderkommando consistent of only 20 people is a pretty good indication that it was the Wehrmacht rather than the Gestapo that drove the loudspeaker vehicles.They were under the command of Helmut Knochen of the Reich Security Main Office, who later became chief of Gestapo and security for Paris. Knochen was involved in the rounding up of Jews, German emigr\u00e9s and political opponents of the German rule as well as of the execution of SOE agents and in 1942 was transferred the main responsibility of anti-Jewish policy in France after the Wehrmacht had relinquished it.The practice of using loudspeaker vehicles to instruct the citizenry of a city that had been freshly taken is one the Germans seem to have employed mainly in open cities, meaning cities where there was the reassurance that no resistance was offered. When there was the suspicion of still lingering resistance somewhere, they rather used poster campaigns after establishing themselves there as far as I can tell.So, to sum up, the description offered in Casablance is somewhat accurate as in the loudspeaker vehicles existed and were employed in Paris but they were not from the Gestapo but rather from the Wehrmacht itself.Sources aside those mentioned:* Jacques Delarue: The Gestapo.* Henry Sergg: Paris Gestapo.* Michael Wildt: An uncompromising Generation.Edit:On the Geheime Feldpolizei: Klaus Ge\u00dfner: Geheime Feldpolizei: Die Gestapo der Wehrmacht.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Nazis did not have loudspeaker cars in Paris.

At the end of the war, Germany, the aggressor, remained occupied by the three powers (and a resurgent France), its cities in ruins, and its economy in tatters. Britain, the old imperial power found itself nearly bankrupt after six years of war. America, economically the strongest of the big three, found itself lending supplies to both of the allies, and with the end of the war, loaning money to its allies as well as the liberated countries of Europe. The Soviets, unlike their allies wer alone in suffering the rigours of a horrific invasion, its economy mauled by German aggression and an unheard of proportion of its people slaughtered, an invasion which only by gargantuan effort had it successfully repelled.Throughout the conflict, the allies, despite their ideological differences, optimistically maintained their alliance, hoping for its continuation after the peace. During the war, the allies were careful to maintain amicable relations: Churchill, staunch opponent of Communism commented at a dinner during the Tehran conference, in 1943 that the 'complexion of the world was changing and that a common meeting ground might be found for the different colors [sic].' Stalin is reported to reply by saying that even Churchill's complexion may be getting 'a little pinker'.In 1943 the alliance between the USSR, Britain and America was vital to victory, Churchill's comment shows the Anglo-American desire to maintain military cooperation with the Soviet Union despite any political differences. The 1943 conferences' main purpose was not to address conflicting political interests in a defeated Germany, but instead to concentrate on the coordination of allied operations within Europe, at Potsdam, in 1945 it was assumed that the allies could continue their collaboration into peacetime.The fate of a defeated Germany was barely considered by the allies at this point, post war plans had to wait until victory became a firm reality, and prior to the second Quebec conference in 1944 the US president reportedly had 'no real plan for the management of occupied Germany.' Stalin, forever paranoid was primarily interested in 'arrangements that would give the Soviet Union secure borders.' His desire for secure borders however, was not coupled with a comprehensive plan for German division, and he was reluctant to propose any particular policy instead endeavouring to discover what his allies had in mind, but he did favour partition. British plans were mostly concerned with ensuring that Germany would not rise to begin again another war, and the maintenance of the alliance was considered important for the maintenance of the balance of power in Europe.Henry J Morgenthau, United States Secretary of the Treasury, proposed a partition of Germany which would be combined with forced de-industrialisation to prevent any resurgence of German aggression, the plan was criticised by the committee of Post-War programs, in a memorandum to Roosevelt, as an impractical solution, as the division and de-industrialisation would have to be maintained by military force, and ultimately, would lead to a new nationalistic desire to reunite.Like military policy, potential occupied policy was strongly influenced by the interest of maintaining the alliance, Eden, and some of the British foreign office felt that a 'soft peace' towards Germany would only arouse Russian enmity. General Eisenhower felt that the demands for a 'soft peace' were influenced by those who 'wanted to make Germany a bulwark against Russia' and instead believed that Russia 'had all she could digest' and advocated letting the 'Germans stew in their own juice.' It was also at the second Quebec conference that allied occupation policy was agreed, specifically the zonal division of Germany, zones which would form the eventual borders of a divided Germany.The problem then began with the cessation of the conflict. The Allies had never come to a conclusion of how to occupy Germany, they had agreed upon zones of occupation, but they had not agreed upon how they would administer those zones, and no coherent policy had emerged on how to deal with reconstruction and reparations. As it transpired, the Americans did not adopt the Morgenthau plan, whilst the British administration had generally been in favour of allowing limited reconstruction. American and British pressure also convinced the French to abandon their more stringent reparations, and the three nations essentially encouraged reconstruction within Western Germany by 1947. To Stalin, and the USSR, the relaxation of economic sanctions and new efforts to encourage reconstruction were potentially not seen as driven by humanitarian concerns, but instead by strategic ones. Stalin, ever paranoid could see in American and British attitudes a distinct desire to rebuild and rearm Western Germany. Considering that the Soviet Union had just endured and fought the brunt of the largest conflict in History, one that had been mostly fought within Europe on Soviet territory, Stalin's misgivings are not entirely unreasonable. Arguably, the institution of the blockade, and the increasing tensions between the East and West are both the result of a Soviet desire to actually prevent further conflict (counter-intuitive though it may sound) the remainder of the Allies could not hope to defeat the USSR, but the allies with the assistance of a newly rebuilt, rearmed and revitalised West Germany would be an entirely different prospect.**Sources: Primary**Foreign relations of the United States.

The American government has always funded itself, in part, by money from its people. If you apply some quick logic, you can realize pretty quickly that there are many different ways for a state or country to collect enough taxes to run necessary programs - after all, there are a number of states that currently do not collect direct/income tax, and they all still provide many services to their populations. For basic terminology, direct taxes are those pulled straight out of income/earnings/revenue. Indirect taxes are tariffs (taxes on goods as they enter or exit a territory), sales taxes, property taxes, etc. The United States government has always collected taxes, but post-revolution, the government wasn't too thrilled with the idea of imposing direct taxes, and the Constitution required that any taxes collected by the federal government to be proportional to a state's population. The new government still needed money, though, and so collected tariffs on certain high value goods (like whiskey and glass). New expenses (war, namely) led to a greater need for government funds, and so the government continued to impose further taxes - on property in the 1790's and then, drumroll... on income, during the Civil War. The Revenue Act passed in 1861 (and the I.R.S. was created!) and the government began collecting direct taxes on incomes over $800/year. This lasted for a decade before being rescinded in 1872. Another income tax law was passed in 1894, then was ruled unconstitutional (for not taking into account states' populations) a year later, but Americans and the government began to realize the necessity of direct taxes. And so the 16th Amendment, which allows for direct taxes to be levied by the federal government without regard to state population, was passed in 1909 and ratified in 1913.

Establishments catering to gay men had existed in major American cities in one form or another since the 18th century, as well as establishments that tolerated gay clientele to a degree, but in the 1920s establishments aimed at gay clientele followed the overall social zeitgeist the same as establishments catering to straight people, either accommodating or circumventing the strictures of Prohibition. In New York City, you might find an accommodating establishment in the Village or the Bowery, on the Lower East Side or in Harlem, at various price points from seedy to glamorous and with clientele from various backgrounds. There you might find working-class men who self-identified as trade as well as self-identified fairies and queers, middle- and upper-class artists and gentlemen mingling with their social peers and slumming it with the lower classes, New York natives and first-generation immigrants as well as men who moved to New York City to escape hometown heterosexual obligations. (There were queer women in similar positions in Harlem and the Village, facilitated by rental spaces that accommodated unmarried female residents, but that's somewhat outside the scope of this question.) African-American gay men often frequented different establishments than white gay men did -- black patrons risked being refused admittance into predominantly-white establishments and neighborhoods, but there were often white spectators at predominantly-black social events for the queer community of Harlem, and white queer people were especially caught up in this vogue. In terms of Roaring Twenties-style queer glamour, Harlem's drag balls made a mark -- these gatherings had star power that crossed racial lines and drew in big-name figures of the Harlem arts scene. (The Harlem Renaissance had a significant queer presence -- if you want culture and killer conversation, that's your niche.) In addition to private gatherings, there arespeakeasies in Harlem where black gay men and women might have a good time and let their hair down -- both flamboyant setups with overtly queer-themed entertainment (like [the Clam House](_URL_1_) on 133rd Street) and more low-key basement establishments for drinking and socializing, making dates and doing business. Across the board, in gay-oriented or gay-friendly establishments you could drop in on a drag show or listen to a musical performance, network with fellow queer people, have a drink or three, order dinner, and catch up on the night's events. There were risks --  police were hostile toward those they suspected of being gay, and the risk of being physically accosted and/or robbed by similarly hostile strangers was fully present -- but if you had an eye for queer nightlife and were reasonably adept at reading the signs, you could mingle and make connections with both relative ease and relative safety. There were also certain norms of body language and coded interaction that might allow gay men of the 1920s to identify other sympathetic or interested parties -- even relatively subtle actions like purposeful eye contact or the offer of a cigarette. These clues could be deployed even in superficially straight establishments with a reasonable amount of plausible deniability -- after all, it's not a crime to shoot meaningful glances at another man when you're asking him the time of day or to offer another man a cigarette. A straightforward pick-up wasn't especially difficult to come by either -- if the night's entertainment was a bust the evening might culminate in cruising a public park, visiting Times Square in search of an obliging partner, or dropping by the Navy Yard to meet up with a sailor. In several major cities you might be offered the services of a male sex worker by the same cab driver or neighborhood regular who could point you in the direction of where to buy liquor, sometimes even before you thought to inquire after one. This wasn't necessarily a service exclusively brokered to gay people -- as many would-be social reformers found out firsthand, a New York waitress fresh out of women to set up with her male clientele might offer to make them a date with a local \"fairy\" instead, and a Chicago pimp might try to entice an undercover vice agent inquiring after loose women with the memorable offer, *\"wouldn't a boy do?\"* -- the overall premise being that \"fairies\" and boys might do in a pinch even for men who didn't necessarily identify themselves as homosexual or queer. Chicago's ~~East~~ South Side had a reputation for sex work in this era, so for many young people growing up queer in Chicago, the sense of an affinity between \"vice\" and gay identity seems to have been strong, and entering into the gay community often entailed entering into sex work, either buying or selling. Outside New York and Chicago, one could find establishments frequented by gay men in cities as far-flung as Baltimore and Minneapolis, Boston and New Orleans; outside the US you could find them in urban Ontario, in London, in Paris, in Berlin, and beyond. (France and Germany had their own gay rights struggles during this era, but their capitals had a reputation for relative tolerance among the British and American queer community.) All in all, the proverbial corridors of power were still barred to out gay men and women in this era, and it was still nearly unheard-of to be out and gay in most areas of \"respectable\" professional life, but the changing social mores of the post-WWI era allowed urban gay men greater liberty than in previous decades as well as greater visibility, much as the post-WWII era would in a few decades.

Soviet Marshall Georgi Zhukov once had the word \"rout\" censored to \"withdrawal.\"  A picture from Stalingrad showing Chuikov's 62nd Army staff gathering and laughing as a man held a machine gun... well that was actually a puppy.  Things like that happened all the time and it meant that information was either untrustworthy, OR2. The West didn't trust Soviet sources.  A CIA paper written in the late 1950's titled \"Caeser X 59\" basically disregards most earlier writings and only then starts to trust sources from the Soviets.  The CIA had a unique take because3.

Reading Alan Clark's Barbarossa (first published in 1965), it seems like the Soviets learned in the Spring/Summer 1942 how to retreat and withdraw before being encircled.  There is now serious doubt that this was the case.  Internal documents (Glantz and the first book in the Stalingrad trilogy has a lot on this) shows that these withdrawals were often piecemeal and against orders from Stavka (Soviet High Command).  Veteran testimony that has come out recently sure talks about morale issues and retreats and a shattered army.  This is all new. & #x200B;We now have documents showing that Chuikov tried to move the HQ of the 62nd Army to the East bank of the Volga... twice.  This is laid out in a book that is really high on Chuikov (Michael K. Jones - Stalingrad: How the Red Army Triumphed). & #x200B;Speaking of Stalingrad.  What a good example of how Stalin and the Red Army learned how to attack at one place at one time.  Right?  I mean, we have internal cables from Zhukov telling officers how to fight in the Winter of 1941-1942 (he literally had to tell officers that they should use recon, then air, then artillery, then have more dudes than the enemy, check Glantz - When Titans Clashed, stuff like that which could be embarrassing to the Red Army is far more widely available now).  Anyway, Operation Uranus wasn't the only attack.  The Soviets had multiple operations around Rzhev that led to hundreds of thousands of casualties... each.  These were, by and large, lost to history until Russian historians got access to the archives and the West got access to them. & #x200B;The Purges are being reconsidered.  I would read Richard Overy \"Russia's War,\" but new numbers post archives show that the Red Army officer corps was larger than we thought and that more men were let out of prison and back into the army than we thought (think Rokossovsky). & #x200B;Some historians think that Lend-Lease was FAR more important than previously thought.  Jonathon House, using post-archive numbers puts the number of American trucks up to 500,000.  He argues that Kursk would not be possible without US help, adding years to the length of the war.  Albert Weeks \"Russia's Lifesaver\" brings some of those Russian numbers to an English translation if you want to check them out.  I find the book not super useful, but the figures are nice. & #x200B;You get chilling internal memos like the NKVD records from the Winter War against Finland.  When they were considering how to re-write infantry manuals after losing tens of thousands of men, one commissar noted that they needed to start training men how to go to ground under fire (Catherine Merridale - Ivan's War), yeah... crazy stuff. & #x200B;David Glantz is probably the go-to on this for a Western reader.  His Stalingrad series uses Soviet and German records to painstakingly detail the day by day order of battle and location of the units as the battle unfolds.

Stewart has a whole chapter on this general topic in *Names on the Land*. He says that Arkansas is the only state name \u201cabout which pronunciation and spelling ever rose to be a major issue\u201d. Arkansas/Arkansaw, originally referring to the river, was part of the Louisiana Purchase and, like many other place names in the region, Americans adopted the French pronunciation (or at least an approximation of it). And the name was often, but not always, spelled accordingly: Arkansaw.In 1819 Congress passed a law creating a territory spelled, according to the Act of Congress, Territory of Arkansaw. In the very same year a New Yorker named William Woodruff moved to the new capital of Arkansaw Territory. Woodruff felt very strongly about language and spelling. He even attacked Noah Webster for including the word \u201clengthy\u201d in his dictionary, for clearly not being a real word. Woodruff was also a printer by trade and set up a newspaper in the new Arkansaw Territory. In the first issue he printed the Act of Congress that had created Arkansaw Territory. In this Act the word \u201cArkansaw\u201d occurred eight times. Woodruff felt very strongly it ought to be Arkansas, which was still a common alternate spelling. In his newspaper\u2019s printing of the Act of Congress he changed all eight mentions of Arkansaw to Arkansas.The population of the territory was only about 10,000, and very many could not read. And most had little to no preference over the spelling of the territorial name. In any case, Woodruff\u2019s newspaper had a huge influence on this particular issue. As Stewart puts it, \u201cApparently even Congress forgot about [their] original spelling, and later bills used Arkansas\u201d. Reprintings of the Act of Congress quickly started spelling it Arkansas, even official, federal printings. In short, official documents \u201csimply changed the spelling without comment, as if a mere clerical error were being corrected\u201d.As the years passed the people of Arkansaw Territory more and more spelled it Arkansas, yet continued to pronounce it Arkansaw. In other parts of the US there was the feeling that the spelling and pronunciation should match. And as the spelling Arkansas became common some people began to pronounce it \u201cArk\u00e1nsas\u201d, like the state Kansas, with ar- prepended\u2014although the place names Arkansas and Kansas have different etymologies and the close resemblance is coincidence [ed: or not, see below]. As more time passed even some of the people of the territory began to say Ark\u00e1nsas. Still, both spellings and pronunciations were fairly common.In 1836 the territory was made a state, spelled Arkansas. Yet there was still a question about pronunciation. In the 1840s the two senators from Arkansas disagreed with each other about it. In Congress this resulted in one being called \u201cthe senator from Arkansaw\u201d and the other as \u201cthe senator from Ark\u00e1nsas\u201d.By 1850 the issue was not solved at all, neither pronunciation or spelling. Some gazetteers spelled the state Arkansas, some Arkansaw. Some offered both, and both pronunciations too. Sometimes the state was spelled Arkansas and the river was spelled Arkansaw. As the state of Kansas became developed and well known, it helped solidify the spelling Arkansas over Arkansaw, and for many people made the pronunciation Ark\u00e1nsas common\u2014with an accent on the second syllable. Still, the people of Arkansas still overwhelmingly pronounced it Arkansaw.After the Civil War many people immigrated to Arkansas and brought their pronunciation Ark\u00e1nsas with them. This pronunciation became common in Little Rock. Stewart says, \u201cBy 1880 anyone might have decided that Arkansaw was a dying and backwoodsy manner of speech\u201d. However, the natives of Arkansas would not so easily change their ways, and before long the issue became important. The pronunciation, and even spelling \u201cArkansas\u201d became to be condemned by natives of the state as \u201cYankee persecution\u201d. Increasingly there were calls for rejecting Ark\u00e1nsas.In 1880 the legislature of Arkansas took up the issue and formed a committee to resolve things. The committee, being mostly made up of native Arkansans, was not unbiased and from the start worked for \u201cArkansaw\u201d. They supported this in many ways, drawing from history, tradition, etc (though undoubtedly cherry-picking to some degree). They even cited the Yankee Longfellow, who had written \u201cI prefer the sound Arkansaw as being more musical than Arkansas\u201d. The committee\u2019s final report unanimously recommended the pronunciation Arkansaw. I\u2019m not sure if they said anything about the spelling, which by then was rather firmly established as Arkansas.In 1881 the state legislature passed an official resolution declaring the pronunciation to be \u201cArkansaw\u201d, in accord with the local manner of speech. They also declared the pronunciation Ark\u00e1nsas \u201can innovation to be discouraged\u201d.For most of the country, this settled it. The state was spelled Arkansas but pronounced Arkansaw. So be it. *Except*! There is also the Arkansas River, which flows through a great deal of Kansas. The people of Kansas tended to call the river the Ark\u00e1nsas River. And there was a town by the border called Ark\u00e1nsas City. After the state of Arkansas declared the pronunciation Arkansaw, and the rest of the country said \u201cokay\u201d, dictionaries soon began to say the river was also pronounced Arkansaw, as was Arkansas City, in Kansas. Some people of Arkansas tried, mostly half-heartedly, to convince the people of Kansas to pronounce the river and Arkansas City \u201carkansaw\u201d. But since they had called upon local usage tradition in their own support of \u201carkansaw\u201d they could not easily say that the people of Kansas had to abandon *their* local pronunciation traditions.Arkansas City, Kansas, is still pronounced Ark\u00e1nsas. And in much of Kansas the Arkansas River is likewise pronounced Ark\u00e1nsas. The same goes for Arkansas Street, in Wichita, Kansas.But to answer the question directly and tersely, the spelling of Arkansaw Territory was changed to Arkansas mainly due to the efforts of William Woodruff, who started the first newspaper in Arkansaw Territory but always published the name \u201cArkansas\u201d. Congress didn't seem to care, or even realize, possibly, that they had named it Arkansaw but soon began spelling it Arkansas. As for why the spelling and pronunciation don\u2019t match, it is because both come via the earlier French place names\u2014the same reason the same is true for Illinois.*Names on the Land*, George R. Stewart.edit PS: Stewart might be wrong about the etymology of Arkansas and Kansas being unrelated. William Bright, in *Native American Placenames of the United States* says they *do* derive from the same Siouan root, but there is some additional complexity I don't have time to get into at the moment. One bit though is that Arkansas comes from a French interpretation of an Algonquian language term, which involves a Siouan term within it.(edit: tpyos, words)", "label": 0}, {"content": "The state of Arkansas was apparently originally known as the Territory of Arkansaw [sic].

By the turn of the 20th century, Venezuela was politically unstable and heavily indebted. A civil war and skirmishes with local *caudillos* made the country a hot mess to rule over, and political and economical growth was going slowly.Enter Juan Vicente Gomez. Second-in-command for President Cipriano Castro, he seized power from him in 1908 as the latter went abroad for surgery. And until his death in 1935, he oversaw the change from a crop-based economy to an oil-exporting one, and it would remain as such till today. He was the first one to direct the oil revenues to modernization and infrastructure development, while taking a large cut for himself and his cronies. The concession-based model for mining and oil extraction that would last until the 1970s, along with minuscule taxation, allowed the foreign companies to take abroad most of the profits from the oil.Although the Natives and Spaniards knew about the presence of oil beneath the surface thanks to oil seeps, industrial drilling did not take place until the 1910s, due to an increased demand from industrialization and the advent of the internal combustion engine. And in 1922, the oil well Barroso II blew out, spewing a hundred thousand barrels of oil per day for nine days into the air, which was a wonderful PR move by the oil to announce its bountiful presence, and a beacon for foreign companies (i.e. Shell, Esso, British Petroleum) to start large-scale drilling and, soon, refining. In less than a decade, Venezuela would become the third largest oil producer, and largest exporter, in the world.As mentioned before, the State did not really partake on this bonanza, making most of its income by selling concessions to drill. Political pressures towards democracy and a fair share of the revenues had to wait until Gomez's death in 1935. The country began a slow transition towards democracy and in 1943, it was codified into Law that the State would receive half of the profits from the oil industry. An even bigger share meant larger projects, and with the advent of the first truly democratic government of Romulo Gallegos in 1948, the country was already planning or working on massive public projects: [Caracas' University City](_URL_8_), [housing and government offices](_URL_6_), [industrial development](_URL_0_), [bridges](_URL_7_)...Around this time, a military government by Marcos Perez Jimenez took hold, ruling between 1952-1958. Oil revenue was essentially unchanged, but modernization and development became a matter of prestige and national security. Also around this time, there was a serious discussion on what to do with the oil revenue. Ultimately the \"Sowing the Oil\" concept, developed by Arturo Uslar Pietri, dominated. That means that the best way to invest the oil revenue was to invest in the people and the country; via the aforementioned massive public projects but also funding public education, healthcare, and culture, as well as working to export refined goods and not crude oil, and invest on other industries (most notably steel).By 1961, with democracy properly restored, the country was prosperous. ~~A few years before, the Venezuelan Bolivar was the highest valued currency in the world.~~ ^^1 A welfare state was in place, ensuring the oil revenues were distributed among the people. Politically, a two-party system took hold, which did not allow for much change. And collusion between the parties, as well as the ridiculous amount of state revenue, allowed corruption and inefficiency to flourish. But as long as the oil kept flowing, this could be maintained, and the people were happy.In 1976, oil was fully nationalized, and PDVSA, the State's oil company, began operations. Venezuela was known at this time as the \"Saudi Venezuela\", with a high quality of life and an enviable position in Latin America. But shortly thereafter, in the 1980s oil glut, coupled with mismanagement, inefficiency, and corruption, as well as a political desire to keep the welfare state in place, led to bad fiscal and economic policies such as devaluing and fixing an exchange price for the Bolivar and ballooning public debt. The system was unsustainable, and the situation worsened until the nation required a bailout from the IMF. This proved wildly unpopular, and led to [massive protests](_URL_9_), [two coup attempts and an impeachment](_URL_4_) and, ultimately, inflation and worsening economic conditions that led to the rise of Hugo Chavez in 1998.This basically covers 20th century Venezuela.

The entirety of the Korean peninsula was under military occupation by the Japanese Empire, and in fact had been since the early 1910\u2019s.  The occupation was brutal, Koreans were treated as slaves (sexual and otherwise), and Japan did a helluva job in trying to extinguish Korean culture altogether.  But that\u2019s for another post.At the conclusion of the war, the Korean peninsula was divided \u2013 much like Germany \u2013 into two zones of control; the southern half would be put under the supervision of the nascent United Nation ~~(and de facto NATO control)~~, while the northern half was occupied by the Soviet Union.  This came about because of quite a few reasons that are complicated and don't really factor into what I'm talking about...  there's a more detailed explanation is in the below comments.  There was initially a hope of a peaceful reunification into a single Korean nation, but\u2026 y\u2019know\u2026 then there was the Cold War, and that went out the window.  Enter Stage Left: Kim Il Sung.  With the backing of the Soviet general Terentii Shtykov, Kim was made the chairman of the Provisional People\u2019s Committee for North Korea (*Bukjoseon Inmin Wiwonhoe*) in February 1946.Under Soviet control, the feudal landlord system that had been \u201cthe norm\u201d in the Joseon Kingdom as well as during the Japanese Occupation was ended, with most of the upper classes/landlord and people with ties to Japan fleeing south.  Under Shtykov\u2019s direction, key industries were nationalized.  But from the outset, Kim Il-sung was positioning himself to be the ultimate power in North Korea once the Soviets inevitably departed back to Moscow (which would occur some 2 years later in 1948.)  From Cummings: >  Kim became the top leader when he chaired the North Korean Interim People\u2019s Committee in February 1946, and he held on to maximum power until he died.  Within months of his accession to power, the evidence of a hagiographic and grandiose style was almost as palpable as it is today.  Agents making forays into North Korea in 1946 reported that pictures and posters of Kim festooned telephone poles and the like with tales of how \u201cwise, clear-sighted, spirited, and wonderful\u201d Kim Il-sung was.  At the same time, articles appeared describing him as \u201cthe Sun of the Nation,\u201d \u201ca beautiful new red star in the sky,\u201d wisely guiding everything with his \u201cbrilliant, scientific\u201d methods.A further example of this early deification can be found from Kim\u2019s own personal biographer \u2013 which remains the \u201cofficial state history\u201d in North Korea even today.  The author, an unknown member of the guerrilla unit he had commanded during the resistance to Japanese occupation, wrote: >  This sort of person naturally has an extremely strong power of attraction to others [\u2026] And it goes without saying that a guerrilla organization with such a person at the center is incomparably strong.  The sublime good fortune of our guerrilla detachment was to have at our center *The Great Sun*.  Our general commander, great leader, sagacious teacher, and intimate friend was none other than General Kim Il Sung.  Our unit was an unshakeable one, following General Kim and having General Kim as the nucleus.  The General\u2019s embrace and love are like the Sun\u2019s, and when our fighters look up to and receive the General, their trust, self-sacrifice and devotion are such that they will gladly die for him.It\u2019s rather interesting the language that this author uses to describe the General.  It\u2019s all highly moralistic \u2013 and all *very Confucian* in nature.  Kim embodies benevolence and love, and inspires in others trust, obedience, and respect.  This is a particularly resonant choice in a traditionally Confucian culture like Korea (and China, for that matter) because it is the very embodiment of the ideal relationship of not only Ruler and Ruled, but also of Father and Son; both are encapsulated in the most important of Confucian ethics \u2013 filial piety.Cummings expands on this particular philosophy as it emerged in the swiftly-developing cult of Kim: >   And eleventh-century Song scholar, Fan Ziyu, said that \u201corder and disorder in the world all depend on the heart-and-mind of the ruler.  If his heart-and-mind are correct, than the myriad affairs of the court will not be incorrect.\u201d  The formula is virtuous-mind-become-master-of-the-body.  Now let the body be the body politic, and presto, the virtuous king becomes its master. [\u2026] Precisely by decades of reading the classics and tutoring by the philosophers [\u2026] the king then becomes a perfected being, \u201cthe supreme mind of the nation,\u201d and woe to the person who challenges his authority or denies that he can walk on water.\u201dCummings points out that, in spite of the Soviet trappings, the North Korean state that emerged from the wreckage of the Second World War was far closer to a Neo-Confucian kingdom like the Song or Ming Dynasties of Imperial China, than of a truly Stalinist-Soviet state.  \u201cWith its absurdly inflated hero worship and its nauseating repetition, the North Korean political rhetoric seems to know no bounds; to a person accustomed to a liberal political system it is instinctively repellent.  But it had been there from the beginning.\u201d  And indeed, it was **the** dominant political ideology across East Asia for millennia.  The Chinese emperors were the literal Sons of Heaven, so too the Japanese Emperor being a literal embodiment of the Sun God, or even the Mongolian Khans claiming the mandate of Tengri \u2013 the Child of the Blue Sky.  Koreans had been wholehearted followers of this philosophy of governance for thousands of years, that its was natural and right that there would, in essence, be a divine Mandate of Heaven conferred onto a single and singular individual who would embody the entire collective wisdom, righteousness, and morality of the whole nation and people.  Once you understand where that idea comes from \u2013 and how long it dominated not just the Korean peninsula, but East Asia as a whole \u2013 its adoption by someone like Kim Il Sung, and its acceptance by the People of North Korea \u2013 doesn\u2019t seem so far fetched.  If anything, its ultimately rejection by all of its neighbors in their own political systems \u2013 South Korea, China, and Japan \u2013 was something of a miracle in itself.  The PRC still operated under effectively the Great Man Personality Cult of Mao Zedong until his death in 1978, South Korea.  Japan had their Confucian-inspired \u201cruled by the Sun God\u201d political system forcibly overthrown by an outside power in 1945, and even South Korea was under the military thumb of Park Chung-hee until his assassination in 1979\u2026 and even now his daughter, Park Geun-hye, is the *current president* of South Korea.  East Asia hasn\u2019t divorced itself as completely from the Confucian-dynastic style of rule as one might initially think\u2026________________#The Korean WarIn September 1948, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea was officially declared with Soviet backing (and tacit understanding that they held legal sovereignty over the entire peninsula, not just the northern half).  Kim was, of course, at the helm as Party Chairman.  Nevertheless, there\u2019s quite a bit of evidence showing that both the USSR and China only actually backed Kim\u2019s push toward \u201cre\u201dconquest of the South with extreme reluctance.  Mao, for instance, only approved of the invasion once Kim had assured him that he\u2019d already gotten Ol\u2019 Papa Joe\u2019s approval.  Weatherby writes:  >  In the spring of 1950 Stalin\u2019s policy toward Korea took an abrupt turn. During meetings with Kim Il Sung in Moscow in April,66 Stalin approved Kim\u2019s plan to reunify the country by military means and agreed to provide the necessary supplies and equipment for the operation. The plan to launch the assault on South Korea was Kim\u2019s initiative, not Stalin\u2019s. The Soviet leader finally agreed to support the undertaking only after repeated requests from Kim. Furthermore, Stalin\u2019s purpose was not to test American resolve; on the contrary, he approved the plan only after having been assured that the United States would not intervene.This, of course, didn\u2019t exactly go as planned.  The US and ~~NATO~~ the UN did indeed intervene, and rather than rolling over the South, the North Koreans themselves got rolled all the way back up to their northern border before the PRC\u2019s PLA at last stepped in and ground the whole conflict into a stalemate that \u2013 as each and every article on the Korean War and/or North Korea simply *must* reiterate (as so who am I to break tradition?) \u2013 technically is still ongoing.(Part 2 Below)", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Kim family has ruled North Korea since the Korean War.

It focused more on while he was alive than when he was dead, so to expand briefly on this specific part, as I noted there, upon his death, Hitler's estate fell mostly into the hands of the German State of Bavaria. This included his estate, the Berghof, as well as art, and some unspecified amount of money in several accounts, but at minimum around 1 million RM. Ironically, this wasn't that far from his dictate in his personal will, which it could be said this was in compliance with, even if he might dispute whether the state, as he concieved it, had been destroyed: > What I possess belongs \u2014 in so far as it has any value \u2014 to the Party. Should this no longer exist, to the State, should the State also be destroyed, no further decision of mine is necessary.*However*, there were specific bequests he had made which were not initially followed, specifically the provisions made to provide for the maintenance of certain persons: > [Borman, his executer] is permitted to take out everything that has a sentimental value or is necessary for the maintenance of a modest simple life, for my brothers and sisters, also above all for the mother of my wife and my faithful coworkers who are well known to him, principally my old Secretaries Frau Winter etc. Who have for many years aided me by their work.Hitler's sister Paula Hitler Wolf spent a number of years attempting to get her inheritance, which she felt justified both by being included in his will, as well as being his nearest surviving relative. She desired both a part of the estate, as well as the potentially lucrative publishing rights to his works (which, as a side note, being held by the Bavarian state allowed them to prevent publication of Mein Kampf in Germany until recently). She began the attempt in the late 1940s, with several legal efforts, continued to be shot down. The essential argument against her claim was that as a Nazi war criminal, all his property was forfeit and his heirs had no claim to it. Additional protestations were based on the claim that the will had legal deficiencies leading it to be declared invalid.Even still though, even then there was the necessity of declaring Hitler *legally* dead to ensure the bureaucratic niceties were met, something which was presumed, but still needed the Ts crossed and Is dotted, having lacked a body. The legal proceedings for this were begun in 1952, and finished in 1956, with the formal, official pronouncement of death certified on January 11, 1957. This allowed for the final, official passing of title to the legal heir of his various properties, mostly being Bavaria, as well as the German Federal state and Austrian state in a few cases.However, Paula was dogged in her attempts. She finally got a court ruling to reverse the earlier decision, and on Feb. 17, 1960 the Munich Lower Court issued her a certificate declaring her rights as heir under the will, and to have claim to 2/3 of his estate. The other 1/3 was split between Alois Jr. and Angela Hitler, Hitler's half-siblings. Alois' children having thoroughly disavowed their uncle, seem not to have attempted to claim theirs. Paula then died four months later without ever getting anything, but Angela's two children, Leoo and Elfride, were granted her inheritance later that year. Just what they were able to claim seems unclear. Elfride reportedly refused to accept her part of the inheritance, while Leo did do so. The copyright to Mein Kampf remained somewhat muddled, and although Paula sold her *claimed* rights to it to a Swiss lawyer, it seems never to have been treated as anything but Bavarian state property, and any attempts to wrest that failed, whatever the disputes.Of course as an addendum, it is possible - even likely- Hitler had secret accounts, perhaps Swiss or under aliases, which were never known, but no search seems to have ever turned up anything on that front, so we can only speculate what might have happened to themMostly from Hitler\u2019s Fortune by Chris Whetton as well as Hitler: The Survival Myth by Donald McHale.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The bank account was closed in 1945, and the money was seized by the German government.

Rather, it\u2019s a confluence of a great deal of factors, some natural and some artificial, from basic geography to poor economic planning. The complex answer- well, let\u2019s get started.\u2022\t**Geography**Let\u2019s take a look at a [topographic map of North Korea](_URL_1_). This should give you some information right off the bat. The Korean Peninsula is an incredibly mountainous landmass to begin with, and the Northern half is more mountainous by far. The only significant plains exist in the southwest, in the Kwans\u014f (formerly Pyongan) region. This is where the capital city of Pyongyang is located.This does not leave the country with much arable land to begin with, a measly 19%, even with their decades of land reclamation projects. Compounding this is the climate of the country. North Korea\u2019s growing season is very short, and winter comes quickly. So even the briefest look at the nation reveals a large population living in a very mountainous, cold climate- a solid foundation for famine. As a brief sidenote, if you\u2019re wondering why the country is divided as such, with much of the fertile land in the South (traditionally the breadbasket of Korea) join the club. The division of Korea was a pretty frantic affair that was exclusively based around US-Soviet interests. But that\u2019s a story for another day.\u2022\t**Agriculture**Historically, North Korea has made a number of extremely poor choices with regards to its agricultural production. Tackling food production with the same aggressiveness that they did the rebuilding campaign, under the leadership of Kim Il Sung the DPRK began to massively overuse fertilizers and chemicals in an attempt to maintain continuous cropping (which is exactly what it sounds like) for maximum growth.In addition, the mountainous areas were bled for all their arable land in a series of slash-and-burn campaigns that heavily deforested the Northern half of the peninsula. In sum, all of this increased both acreage and production, at the steep cost of massive soil erosion and permanent ecological damage to the country of North Korea.Out of all of Kim Il Sung\u2019s decisions, the agricultural policy of the early DPRK is truly a mistake that stands alongside the invasion of the South. The lack of foresight for any other nation would be devastating, but for a fledging nation whose ultimate goal was ideological, political and economic self-reliance to pursue such destructive and short-sighted food production strategies is beyond irresponsible, and it all contributes to the state of famine in North Korea even today.\u2022\t**Industry**Industry can be generally divided into heavy and light- and while weight and process intensity are a factor in this distinction, end user is the main thing to consider. When you think heavy industry, think steel, ships, rockets, chemical plants, construction equipment: producers of things that are best used by other large firms. When you think light industry, think everything else: consumer goods, from clothing to home appliances. Now, while many nations in Asia take pride in their heavy industry capacity, the DPRK takes this to an illogical extreme: Victor Cha\u2019s analysis of the Three-Year Economic Plan of 1954-1956 shows that 81% of its resources were diverted to heavy industry, with the remainder going to light industry. This was a disparity so great it gave the DPRK\u2019s benefactors (the Soviet Union) extreme pause.How does this affect famine in North Korea? There are two ways. One, it creates an enormously top-heavy economy with no concern for consumers, which keeps markets (legal or illegal) in gridlock. A more active consumer economy could\u2019ve resulted in a more active unofficial distribution system, which could\u2019ve played some role in alleviating famine. More importantly, a highly centralized, highly industrial nation which desires such a focus on heavy industry demands an enormous mobilization of labor, and the only place to find this sort of labor is from the agricultural base. Thus, the DPRK\u2019s industrial designs play a meaningful role in the famine: they kept the economy based on production, and not trade, and kept that production in the service of\u2026 you guessed it, the military. \u2022\t**Distribution**As Amartya Sen noted in *Poverty and Famine*, famine can easily occur in areas with adequate food supply: all that needs to happen is a failure of distribution, be it through government or the free market. If we\u2019ve established a relative paucity of food supply in the DPRK to begin with, and examined how that was exacerbated by short-term thinking, poor industrial planning and ecologically devastating farming strategies, there should be no question that a failing public distribution system could be the spark that lights the fuse of absolutely devastating famine.And according to the sources, that\u2019s exactly what happened. It\u2019s important to note that the PDS in North Korea is not just a means for socialized distribution of resources, rather, it\u2019s a mechanism of state that legitimizes the *songbun* system, which is a three-tiered class system consisting of \u2018core\u2019, \u2018wavering\u2019 and \u2018hostile\u2019 classes, based on family history and closeness to the regime\u2019s revolutionary background. This resulted in what Haggard and Noland refer to as the regional dimensions of the famine.The elite are located in Pyongyang. The most fertile area, too, is located near Pyongyang. The lowest classes are located in the mountainous eastern and northeastern reaches of the country, in provinces like North and South Hamgyong. (This is not random chance- families are very often forced to relocate based on class) The distribution system serves the elite, then the non-\u2018hostile\u2019 like the military and what passes for a middle class in the DPRK, and *then and only then* does it assist the poorest, most marginalized citizens. Who, as we\u2019ve established, eke out an existence in both urban and rural locales the furthest from the most arable land.This, I think, may be the biggest individual point in answering your question. If people learn one thing from this response, let it be this: **North Korea has had trouble feeding its people because both food and proximity to food production are privileges afforded first and foremost to the upper class.**\u2022\t**Isolation**For my final point, I\u2019d like to focus on North Korea\u2019s remarkable isolationism, and how that has affected their food shortages, historically.We are focused on events prior to 1993, of course. I will say for the record that the collapse of the Soviet Union is perhaps the primary reason for the unprecedented famine of the mid-90s, but that\u2019s a discussion for another forum. Rather, we\u2019re going to look at the pre-1990s state of North Korean diplomacy.One of the things that surprised me the most when I began to learn about North Korea was the nature of its relationship with the two great powers it borders: Russia and China. I had previously imagined that the Sino-Soviet split had little impact on the nation, considering it was in the interest of both to support their nominal ally as a buffer state. This was not the case.The history of Sino-Soviet-DPRK relations can be dizzying. The installation of the regime is mostly thanks to the Soviet Union, its survival of the Korean War is instead thanks to China. With the end of Stalinism, the DPRK shied away from the Soviets, warming up to China. With the Cultural Revolution, the pendulum swung the other way. In essence, the history of this relationship is one of constant dissatisfaction, and should highlight the existence of the DPRK as asset and annoyance for both of these countries.How does this all add up to famine? Well, the aid the DPRK received from China and the Soviet Union was critical to its survival. The problem is that this aid was never really normalized. Victor Cha does an exemplary job of showing how it rose and fell over the years and through political climates.This relationship was also an exception. The DPRK is closely guarded elsewhere, relying instead on a higher, singular benefactor in an ironic betrayal of *juche*, (perhaps a better official ideology would be *sadaejuui*- flunkeyism). This has had the result of drying up North Korea\u2019s international relationships as the Communist world has crumbled, and its people have suffered greatly for this.\u2022\t**Conclusion**To summarize, the factors affecting the DPRK are not individually insurmountable. Poor economic and agricultural planning can be offset by international trade. Mountainous geography and a cold climate can be overcome by an effective distribution system. Generalized isolation can be maintained with a solid agricultural base and a few *dependable* foreign relationships.It\u2019s in tandem that all of these factors add up to the massive famine that characterizes the modern history of North Korea, a catastrophic state of existence that manifests itself in more ways than just its millions of casualties. It has left [indelible marks on the landscape](_URL_0_) of the country in mass graves and abandoned villages, but more than that- it is visible on the physical character of almost every North Korean.-The primary sources in this post were *The Impossible State* by Victor Cha and *Famine in North Korea* by Stephen Haggard and Marcus Noland. Both are incredibly well written books I recommend to anyone looking to learn more about the country and its unique experiences.EDIT: I sincerely appreciate the gold, as well as the positive responses.

This is about a thousand years outside of my specialisation so I can't talk about it in great detail, but suffice to say that the area surrounding Schleswig and Holstein was an area of contention between the Danish and the Germans, and even before that had been contested by various groups. After the dust settled, all land north of the Eider river was held by the Danish, and all land south was held by the Germans. Holstein formed a part of the Duchy of Saxony. /u/wowbuggertheinfinite posted a more detailed overview lower down the comment chain [here](_URL_3_).Moving forward to 1326, King Valdemar of Denmark *allegedly* made a statement saying that the Duchy of South Jutland (Schleswig) and the Kingdom of Denmark should always remain two separate entities. Proof of this was first produced in 1448 by Christian I of Denmark, and in 1460 Denmark retook Holstein and Schleswig, which had been lost previously. The Treaty of Ribe added the County of Holstein as a possession of the King of Denmark, but not of the Kingdom itself. One phrase in the treaty, that Schleswig and Holstein should be 'forever inseparable', would prove important later.We can understand at this point why the issue becomes so complicated. The Danish Monarchy possessed the Kingdom of Denmark, and the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. However, neither Duchy was itself a component part of the Kingdom of Denmark, rather they were possessions of the *King* of Denmark. To make matters more complicated, in 1665 the Kingdom of Denmark introduced a succession law that allowed females to inherit. Schleswig and Holstein did not, and kept the Salic Law, where women were unable to inhereit. This will also prove important later.Over the years until 1806 there was a bit more back and forth between various Counts, Dukes and Kings with some territorial shifting, but nothing major. After the Holy Roman Empire was formally dissolved in 1806, Denmark extended their influence over Holstein, introducing various language and social reforms. However this was reversed by the Congress of Vienna, who included Holstein in the German Confederation. Given that the Treaty of Ribe had declared Schleswig and Holstein to be forever unseparable, this opened up a whole range of potential problems. With the stage set, we can now move forward to 1846. The male line of the Danish Monarchy is set to die out with the death of Frederick, son of King Christian VIII. Since the Kingdom of Denmark and the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein have different succession laws, a crisis is brewing. 31% of the population of Denmark, mostly concentrated in the two Duchies, spoke German, and the rising star of Prussia offered hopes of a German unification. In 1848, tensions came to a head as Liberal revolutions broke out across Europe, and the attempts of the Danish monarchy to incorporate Schleswig-Holstein into the Kingdom of Denmark proper led to open rebellion. Prussian troops marched into Holstein in order to enforce their independence. The male heir to the Duchy, Christian August, duke of Augustenburg, was declared to be the legitimate ruler.However, Prussia here drew the ire of the other Great Powers of Europe, who up until now hadn't been particularly bothered by the constitutional history of a minor German Duchy. Britain and Russia wished to protect their naval interests and if Prussia could take the harbour at Kiel and build a canal to the North Sea then they had the potential to become a North Sea naval power, an outcome neither Britain nor Russia wanted. Austria were at this time in conflict with Prussia over which country would assume leadership of the German speaking peoples, and so tended to side against Prussia. While they were open to the idea of an independent Schleswig-Holstein, they were highly against idea that it could be integrated into Prussia. Additionally, the wishes of the significant Danish speaking minority in the Duchy had to be taken into account. Sweden sent troops to help Denmark, and Nicholas I of Russia diplomatically pressured the Prussians to withdraw. In 1850 the Treaty of Berlin re-established the status quo before the war, and in 1852 Christian August withdrew his claim.Over the course of the next decade, the Danish slowly tried to consolidate power in the Duchy. The teaching of German in Northern Schleswig was banned, and the teaching of Danish in the rest of Schleswig was emphasised. In 1855 the Danish proposed to create a national assembly, where the Kingdom would have 60% of the members, allowing them to outvote the Duchies. The Duchies naturally protested against this. The situation was rapidly becoming untenable.In 1862 the British tried to propose a new system, but were wary of upsetting the Prussians, with whom they had developed a tentative friendship. By 1864, the situation had changed. Russia was preoccupied with internal issues, Sweden had no real desire to intervene without the backing of other great powers, and Britain no longer desired to hinder Prussia quite so much. Denmark were issued an ultimatum by Prussia and Austria, the latter of whom had joined in an attempt to restrain Prussia. They rejected it, and lost the ensuing war quite badly. They later rejected an international conference set up to solve the dispute and lost the continuation of the war even more badly. Austria and Prussia agreed to split Schleswig between them, with Prussia administering Schleswig and the city of Kiel, and Austria administering Holstein minus Kiel. In 1866, Bismarck declared war on Austria and occupied Holstein. After a short 3 week war the fighting ended with no changes other than the transfer of Holstein to Prussia. The status of Schleswig-Holstein would stay the same until 1920, when a plebiscite saw the Danish speaking north assigned back to Denmark.In conclusion, the Schleswig-Holstein question was an incredibly complicated diplomatic and legal matter that came to a head in a period in which Prussia and Austria were looking to assert their superiority over German-speaking Europe. While war was certainly not inevitable, and the situation could have been solved diplomatically at several points, and attempts were made to do so, with Bismarck at the head of Prussia and German nationalism both in Prussia and Schleswig-Holstein at a fever pitch, it would have required supreme patience and diplomatic skill to do so.Sources:Stacie Goddard, ['When Right Makes Might: How Prussia Overturned the European Balance of Power'](_URL_2_), *International Security*, Vol. 33, No. 3 (Winter, 2008/2009), pp. 110-142Hans Brems, ['The Collapse of the Binational Danish Monarchy in 1864, a Multinational Perspective'](_URL_0_), *Scandinavian Studies*, Vol. 51, No. 4, HENRIK IBSEN ISSUE (AUTUMN 1979), pp. 428-441", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Schleswig-Holstein question was so complicated, only three men in Europe have ever understood it.

Flags have been around as decorative objects for millennia, but the practice of having a single standardized rectangular flag design that stands for a country, its government, its people, and just sort of everything about it comes out of early modern Europe.It was originally a naval practice. Ships flew flags to indicate what country they were from. A rectangular flag catches the wind better than any other shape, so that tended to be the shape that countries would use. Pretty soon the idea of \"a flag that represents a country a sea\" evolved into \"a flag that represents a country in general\", and rectangular flags became more common on land.European imperialism brought these kinds of \"national flags\" to areas that didn't have local traditions of flag use, like Sub-Saharan Africa and the Americas. When states in these parts of the world became independent, they would adopt the same types of symbols that other independent states had (meaning rectangular flags, national anthems, coats of arms, stamps, and so on). Even countries that weren't directly colonized were influenced by European practice. Japan, China, and Siam all adopted rectangular flags in the nineteenth century as their trade and diplomatic interaction with Europe increased.Nepal is the last survivor of an entirely different tradition of flag design based in South Asia and Iran. These flags tended to be more like royal standards, special one-of-a-kind designs that represented the authority of a monarch and weren't really for use by the general public. Because of this they didn't have to be easy to manufacture or practical to use at sea. That meant they were ornate, used a wide range of colours, and came in all sorts of shapes. Triangular pennants were particularly popular.Nepal's kings flew a triangular pennant with the moon on it. But Nepal also had a line of hereditary Prime Ministers, and they had their own flag: a triangular pennant with the sun on it. The two flags were commonly flown together and eventually they just kind of merged into one. Many of India's princely states flew non-rectangular flags like Nepal's, but they were all banned after independence in 1947.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The rectangular flag is the standard because it is the most common shape for flags.

While Bram Stoker's *Dracula* was set in 1893 and predates all of this film nonsense, *Bram Stoker's Dracula* is set in 1897-- for the express purpose of this scene according to Paul Foster's essay in *Textual Revisions: Reading Literature and Film*. [Here's the scene in question](_URL_2_).To answer part of the question, **were there erotic films of this nature in 1897??** Our first reaction might be to dismiss the idea that the characters were in a porno theater before 1900 out of hand, but it would be wrong to accuse the directors of getting something *that* wrong--I'm sure they took lots of film history classes in college too. So what erotic films could they have been watching in 1897? Well the first one to come to mind is *Le Coucher de la Mari\u00e9e,* whicg came out in 1896. You can watch all 90 seconds of [here](_URL_0_). By our standards its pretty SFW and probably wouldn't even warrant a PG rating today. The original version was estimated to run about 7 minutes, but we don't have the rest of the film--only the most erotically charged parts got saved (I wonder why..). Another posssibility might have been *Apr\u00e8s le bal le tub* from 1897 (see it [here](_URL_1_) -- semi-NSFW, but still YouTube ok) which might have possibly *maybe* been in circulation to Bohemia in the same year. Not likely, but I'm stretching it for Coppola's sake. BUT these weren't really pornographic films in that sense--they were vaguely erotic and probably wouldn't have stirred up that much controversy--the first one was played at the 1900 Paris Exposition Universelle and didn't cause any particular riots--although the  18 second *May-Irwin Kiss* (1896) nearlt caused every newspaper in the United States to riot. Indeed, the first surviving \u2018hardcore\u2019 pornographic film doesn't arrive until 1908, from France: *A Les Culs d\u2019Or* (At the Golden Bottom). As Dave Thompson explains, the film  > Dissolves to a view of a country inn, its white plaster walls weather-beaten and stained. A portly, middle-aged and waxed-mustachioed musketeer, clad in all the finery one would expect rom that noble profession, stands outside, knocking on the door and hammering on an outdoor table. He has traveled far and is in need of sustenance.  > The innkeeper, however, has no food. But, unwilling to disappoint so distinguished a customer, he instead ushers the visitor to a seat, then hastens to where one of his staff, a pretty, plump young girl, is cleaning glasses. They exchange some words, then she approaches their guest, leads him to another table, far more secluded than the first, pours him a drink and informs him what is really on the menu\u2014herself.  > With every scene ushered in by one more in a dizziying panopoly of excruciating puns, each allaying some form of physical intimatcy with a food stuff, the cavalier samples each \u2018dish\u2019 in turn: the seafood la crevette, as he extracts one finger from between her legs and tastes it; asperges en branches (an asparagus dish) as he removes his own pants; saucisse (sausage), moule (mussel), the chicken and mushroom hors d\u2019oeuvre bouchees a le reine; and so on, until the cavalier\u2019s climax marks the end of the first course, and the innkeeper serves up the dessert, a second naked girl, cross-legged on a serving platter. The trio fall upon one another with gusto, sandwich a la gousse, and there the reel\u2014and the film\u2014concludes. Unfortunately, I could not find a copy of this online, which is a great shame. However, the first American pornographic film *A Free Ride* (1915, is [available on wikipedia](_URL_3_) [SUPER NSFW]).So the answer is **yes** there were erotic shorts available at the time the movie was set, but **no** they werent any of the ones displayed in the background of the 1992 film. Instead, the array of films in the background seem to be cuts from early erotic shorts, and various scenes from Melies' early horror films like [The Devil's Castle.](_URL_4_) and a completely unrelated cut of Lumiere's *Arrival of the Train at the Station*. So this keys us into one of the glaring factual errors--it is unlikely that this weird pastiche of scenes would have been played at any theater in the history of film.However, one thing that the film gets accidentally(?) right. Eastern Europe, for whatever reason very enthusiastically embraced film technology, and they were one of the first areas to begin showing and producing film. Bohemia and Prague were especially known for their embrace of film and their showings of erotic films-- Erotikon  and Extasy in the early 1900's were two of the most controversial and erotically charged movies of the century--the latter shows nude swimming, intercourse, and is believed to be the first \"capture\" of the female orgasm for a movie. **But** (and of course there's a but) it would not have been common or very accepted to bring a woman into these sorts of theaters. These were very obviously male-dominated spaced--they were called stag films for a reason-- and while prostitutes were sometimes brought to these events, is unlikely that Mina or Lucy would have been welcome or accepted in this men's space.", "label": 0}, {"content": "In the 1890s, porno films were a novelty.

During the Depression, they saw it as a small concession to save Capitalism, but by the War they had abandoned that stance in favor of a United Front against Fascism.Many communists saw the Depression itself as a fulfillment of Marx's theory that capitalism would inevitably consume itself. Marx was one of the first economists to write about the 10-year boom and bust cycle, but believed that this cycle of production and 'overproduction' would inevitably destroy the entire system. According to theory, capitalists look only towards the short-term profits and undercut labor costs as a way of achieving this. Produce more and pay less. Their workers are also their consumers, however, and the prices will regularly become too much to afford - what he termed overproduction, and many Keynesian later called 'underconsumption'.When the overvalued stocks fell through the floor in 1929, anxiety swept the public and millions tried to pull their cash from the banks all at once. This forced them to recall their loans and this in turn forced businesses to close, and put millions into debt. Merchants and farmers burned their own crops and slaughtered their livestock to artificially increase the price and try and stay afloat. Millions were put out of their jobs, often blacks before whites.  At the same time that the consumer base was being destroyed, millions were being put out onto the streets and into 'Hoovervilles'. By 1933, fully one quarter of the working population was unemployed, and in many neighborhoods unemployment was over 50%. Entire families incomes disappeared, and the prices just kept increasing.For many communists of the time, it looked like Marx was being proven right - global capitalism was on its last leg.The CPUSA grew tremendously during the depression, reaching their peak of 85,000 members in 1942 - just as the United States entered WWII.The first of the three reasons for this was the creation of the Unemployment Councils in 1930.  Day-to-day, the Unemployed Councils staffed soup kitchens, flop houses, and raised demands with the administration over sanitation and bad food. They stepped in to prevent evictions and keep gas on. And through that work, they were able to \"raise consciousness\" and become embedded in the communities they served, earning their trust and winning them over to a more radical politic. They organized hundreds of thousands of the angry poor not just for demands of new employment, but an end to employment entirely. The CPUSA especially organized across racial lines, across gender lines, and the Unemployed Councils did the same, organizing white and black workers, men and women, together. The second was their organizing across racial lines and of black workers in particular. James W. Ford ran as the Party's vice presidential candidate for all three years of 1932, 1936 and 1940 - being the first African American to appear on a presidential ballot in the 20th century. The issue of racism was made central to the party's work. As Harry Haywood details in his autobiography [1], this wasn't entirely by the CPUSA's own choice, as most of the membership saw the question of racism as secondary to that of class. The Communist International refused to regard it as mere discrimination, however, and the CPUSA were made to put a significant focus on that issue and treat it instead as one of national oppression. To quote from their Election Platform for 1936: >  The Negro people suffer doubly. Most exploited of working people, they are also victims of Jim-Crowism and lynching. They are denied the right to live as human beings. [2]This work lead to the creation of an active Southern Party that was almost entirely black, and a regional newspaper. The Party became involved in the case of the Scottsboro boys and lead rallies against their incarceration across the country. [3]The third reason was their involvement in labor organizing during this period - especially in the Congress of Industrial Organizations, a union federation that was expelled from the American Federation of Labor for 'industrialism' (that is the organizing across an entire industry and not simply by trade) and for *being communist lead*. The AFL opposed strikes as anything but a last resort, and had been unable to win any through the Depression, until the 1934 strikes of the West Coast Longshoremen, Minneapolis Teamsters, and Auto-lite. All lead by Communists, and expelled from the federation in 1935 over this issue (and punching a union rep in the face during an argument over it). The CIO managed not only to maintain its shops through the depression, but to actually grow and win a dozen other strikes across the country. The CPUSA maintained control of the new federation through the rest of the 30's and enrolled many of the Unemployed Council workers on their rosters, attempting to link the interests of the employed and unemployed and grow picket lines. [4]1936 was also the highest that they ever polled in an election, only receiving 0.26% of the vote [5] - and although Communists have historically denounced elections as a means to real progress, they have upheld them as a good measure of popularity. FDR passed the New Deal in a context where Communism was on the rise, and many communists saw this as an attempt to push off that inevitable doom of capitalism, and to undercut their growing movement by giving out quick-fixes to a deeper issue. They saw it as an attempt to save capitalism.To quote from the Platform, again: >  Roosevelt is bitterly attacked by the forces of reaction. But he does not fight back these attacks. Roosevelt compromises. He grants but small concessions to the working people, while making big concessions to Hearst, to Wall Street, to the reactionaries.In 1937, The Party adopted a United Front against fascism - openly declaring the need for an alliance between socialists and liberals. The 1936 platform stands as a middle ground between their previous opposition to FDR and revolutionary stance, and later tactic of the United Front. The platform both decries the New Deal and fascism - both FDR and Hoover, but in a way that Hoover is denounced as a far greater evil and FDR as merely compromising with the Right.[1] *Black Bolshevik*, by Harry Haywood.[2] _URL_0_[3] *Hammer and Hoe*, by Robin D.G.

My answer here will focus on depictions of fencers in the late 15th century through fencing treatises, and some other medieval depictions. It's a lot of guesswork and extrapolation, and I'll point out the precautions we should be aware of with each type of evidence. Hopefully, someone with more pointed knowledge of this specific subject will come along.______I'm going to take some time to talk about a man named Paulus Kal. Kal was a fencing master who wrote a treatise on the knightly arts, and had a long career as a knight in various capacities, served some civic functions for Nuremberg, and was sworn in service to a couple of dukes. In the 1480s (probably), he wrote his treatise, which contained a fair amount of art.We think Kal depicted himself in the middle [here](_URL_16_), wearing the red/pink suit. He's helping a knight (right) prepare for a duel. Take a look at Kal and a look at the anonymous knight for a moment. Kal doesn't look the way we think of as \"fit\" today. He has a noticable belly, no definition of arm muscles, stout legs. He looks very similar in [other images](_URL_1_), even from (possibly) different artists. Now take a look at the arming knight: again, no muscle definition, the man in fact looks quite thin. It's the same in [most of the images](_URL_15_) throughout the treatise. This could obviously be artistic convention, a simplification of figures to make them easier to depict, or even a visual code to help identify aspects of their fencing. Certainly, Kal's fencers are depicted similarly in other fencing treatises, like [this image](_URL_17_) from Hans Talhoffer. Here's [another](_URL_14_). These images are much more richly detailed, the quality of the art is clearly much higher. There's more textural quality in the depictions of the clothing, of the fingers and details of the joints. WE see obviously muscular calves and glutes. We also see [exaggerated waists](_URL_7_), even of [men in armor](_URL_5_).Fencing takes fitness. Medieval writing often suggested a fitness routine that was summarized by fencing treatises as supplemental not only to fencing, but to the education of young knights. Jorg Wilhalm Hutter, writing in the early 16th century, summed it up as: >  Throwing stones, pushing staves, fencing and wrestling, dancing and jumping, stabbing and jousting...An Italian manuscript from the 15th century [illustrates](_URL_4_) some of these. Notice, again, the cinched waists, the general thinness of the figures, the muscular detail concentrating on the legs. The sun, above them, is ripped, though nott shredded to the degree of hollywood stars, he is noticably more muscular than any figure we've looked at so far, with defined abs and chest, and detailed musculature of the arms and legs.This particular image is part of an astrological concept called \"*planetenkinder*\" or \"planetary children,\" a way to categorize people as taking personality traits from the various planets. Both the image above and [this one](_URL_10_) depict \"children of the sun,\" and show the men there partaking in some of the exercises listed by Hutter. By now, you should be able to pick out the important details.Back to Paulus Kal. He obviously wants to depict the ideal of the fencing and fighting man in his treatise, because these treatises are, in some part at least, meant to promote *his own* skills and knowledge. He makes sure to place himself in the lineage of \"The Society of Liechtenauer,\" a group of men whose knowledge of fencing, wrestling, and other martial skills descends, like the men exercising under the light of the Ripped Sun, from a possibly legendary fencing master of old. It's safe to say that Kal had an interest in depicting the figures in his treatise as ideal, or close to ideal. Same with Talhoffer. What's Kal's ideal?He gives us what we call [\"Kal's birdman.\"](_URL_12_)The writing says: >  I have eyes like a hawk, so you do not deceive me. >  I have a heart like a lion, so I strive forward. >  I have feet like a hind, so I can spring to and fro.Obviously the ideal man is not an exquisite corpse or a nightmarish fusing of animal with human, but we are supposed to understand the animal-like features of the ideal fencer. Eyes that can't be deceived, courage that won't falter, quick feet. But look at the body of this ideal man. No muscle tone, nearly anywhere. An exaggerated waist even with a bit of a gut, thin arms, tapering legs. And just so you know this isn't just one artist's version, here's a copy of Kal's treatise with the [same figure](_URL_11_), similar in all details. This is similar to that way a Talhoffer manuscript showed an [arming knight](_URL_3_), as well: skinny, an impossibly narrow waist, little definition of muscle.[Another](_URL_2_) Kal figure, this time from the mid 16th century. This one differs in that the arms and legs are thicker, and there's obvious muscle in the core and chest, which maybe argues for changes in the idealization of the male figure during the 16th century.Certainly, at least by the early 16th century, depictions of the male body at least got more sophisticated and detailed. The \"Goliath\" *fechtbuch*, a compilation of various earlier fencing treatises likely published between 1510 and 1520, is notable for its [beautiful illustrations](_URL_6_) that give [incredible detail](_URL_18_) about the [fencer's bodies](_URL_20_).So what would the average body type of a medieval fighting man be? We don't know for certain. We can say that, at least in the late 15th century, the depictions commonly emphasize a narrow waist more than any other feature, but also emphasize strong legs and glutes. By the 16th century, we start seeing more consistently muscled men, but the small waist is still highly emphasized, not only by figures that show the body unclothed, but also by the clothing itself and the armor. Fitness was emphasized as a whole-body affair, and young knights were encouraged to engage in a wide variety of activities that would encourage suppleness, dexterity, and strength in equal measure. ______________**Sources**Most of the fencing images came from [Wiktenauer](_URL_8_), an online repository of historical fencing treatises.

The manuscript tradition (...traditions) of the *1001 Nights* is a mess already--our earliest notions of the text are only 1000 nights, for starters, and no surviving copy gets close to having 1001 tales. But probably the most famous of the tales even before Disney has special problems, namely, it isn't actually part of that medieval manuscript tradition at all. The way medieval texts including/especially *1001 Nights* worked, that absolutely doesn't mean it's not just as deeply rooted as others. But when a story first shows up in the 17th/18th century as Europeans are getting their hands on the text, there's room for caution.Fortunately, tales like the frame story \"The Craft and Malice of Women,\" which has an alternate title but why would you ever use it, serve as a fine substitute. The frame and some of its internal tales trace back through the Egyptian manuscript tradition, so we're good here.I dumped a block quote on you at the beginning so you could situate yourself: we've got a \"King of the Kings\" of China (a title that medieval Arabic geographers use when talking about a land they're a bit more familiar with, Persia), an *ulema* or class of Muslim scholars, astrologers, philosophers, religious leaders, and--oh yeah--Islam. In other words, we're dealing with the trappings of medieval Islamic culture in this text, too.But, well...this doesn't exactly coincide with what merchant, diplomats, and ethnographers are writing about China just about the same time people start writing down *1001 Nights* collections (or at least, ones that survive). For starters: >   I do not know of a single member of [China or India] who is a Muslim, and Arabic is not spoken.Our ninth-century informant adopted by 10th century author Ab\u016b Zayd al-\u1e24asan al-S\u012br\u0101f\u012b has more to say comparing the two lands: >  India is the land of medicine and of philosophers; the Chinese also have medical knowledge. Most of their medicine involves cauterization. In addition, they have a knowledge of astronomy and astrology, although this is more widespread in India.Just from the *beginning* of the tale, then, it's clear that *The Craft and Malice of Women* is set in a fantastical China, not the actual one. The examples continue, like houses being made of stucco instead of wood. We'll return to the fantasy in a bit, because as promised: toilet paper.Ab\u016b Zayd and whatever earlier accounts he's drawing on for the first book of his text (he probably doesn't know for sure and it may well have multiple sources; a later author attributes excerpts from it to a merchant called Sulayman) offer a surprisingly rich view of early medieval China. In the beginning of book two, in fact, Ab\u016b Zayd recounts a long history of a recent rebellion! But it's especially fascinating to see what details of Chinese culture the geographer-ethnographers and their sources emphasize. >  The Chinese are unhygienic, and they do not wash their backsides with water after defecating but merely wipe themselves with paper. Yeah, like that one.Throughout the text, comparisons to Arab culture or other known cultures help the original readers understand China and help us understand why Ab\u016b Zayd et al. emphasize particular details. >  Their staple food is rice. They often cook a sauce to go with it, which theypour on the rice before eating it. Their ruling classes, however, eat wheatbread and the \ufb02esh of all sorts of animals, including pigs and other suchcreatures. Eating all meats is a big deal to the Muslim observer. Elsewhere, he compares Chinese religious practices to Zoroastrians. This is a good remind not to take everything at face value, though. Anna Akasoy has shown that \"Zoroastrianism\" (a twisted idea thereof) was a common framework through which Muslim ethnographers sought to understand foreign religions in, for example, West Africa.Given the consternation we see on AskHistorians about medieval Muslims and alcohol, this is a particularly interesting observation: >  Their drink is a wine made from rice. Grape wine is not tobe found in their land, and it is never imported\u2014indeed, they do not know of it and do not drink it. It looks like our author is quite familiar with wine made from grapes!We also learn that the Chinese tax foreign imports at a 30% rate, have a fiscal bureaucracy staffed by eunuchs, and place an enormous premium on reading and writing. I'll include another passage that's a popular interest topic on AskHistorians: a sort of premodern passport: >  Anyone wanting to travel from one part of China to another obtains two documents.The document from the ruler is a permit for the road, made out in the nameof the traveler and those accompanying him, and stating his age and hiscompanions\u2019 ages, and the tribe from which he comes...The second document concerns the traveler\u2019s money and any goods he may have.  >  The reason for thisprocedure is that there are guardposts on the road where they examine bothdocuments, and, when a traveler arrives at one, they write, \"So-and-so, sonof So-and-so, of Such-and-such an origin, arrived at our guardpost on thenth day of the nth month of the nth year, accompanied by So-and-so.\" Thisis in order that none of the traveler\u2019s money or goods should go missing.I don't have to tell you not to take all this as surah truth about early medieval China. In most cases we're dealing with multiple layers of transmission, and a culture where repeating earlier stories was as good as firsthand observation/often treated as firsthand observation. Nevertheless, modern scholars generally consider the fact-checkable points somewhat reliable--at least, much more so than contemporary accounts like *The Wonders of India*, a fascinating collection of sailors' stories in which basically everyone gets shipwrecked on a island of Amazons or cannibals.I've already mentioned the difficult heritage of this text. It survives in one damanged manuscript copy today. But we know that whoever wrote it in the 9th century, it was read and copied in the 10th by Ab\u016b Zayd and by the Persian scholar Ibnal-Faq\u012bh. In other words, in the Middle Ages, this text got around a little!But then we have to balance the scholars versus the storytellers. When we talk about \"medieval Muslims' knowledge of China,\" we shouldn't just think about the best-connected. While obviously also not everyone was reading *1001 Nights* itself, the ubiquity of many of its stories around the Mediterranean world suggests a much more common currency for them than for Ab\u016b Zayd.And don't let the insertion of Islam, science, kings, and harems--perfectly ordinary elements of life to medieval Muslims!--fool you. The China of the *1001 Nights* is a China \"days of yore and in ages and times long gone before\"--it's stocked full of the magic that, even if not the *specific* story of Ala ad-Din, the same air of exoticism and, dare I say it, Orientalism.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Middle Eastern folktale Aladdin was actually set in China, albeit a very Arabian version of China with viziers and djinns.

It wasn't until around 1910 that group matching became common practice and the era of modern transfusions began.The first reported blood transfusion was performed on dogs by Richard Lower at Oxford in 1666. The next year, Jean Denis in Paris was the first to transfuse animal blood into humans. These were in the nature of experiments; it was not medical practice.The first human to human transfusion was done by James Blundell in London in 1818. Blundell was an obstetrician who often saw women bleed to death after labor in postpartum hemorrhages. He gave a woman a transfusion of blood from her husband, and she survived. This was encouraging, so he developed techniques and instruments to do it more easily. Aside from not knowing about blood groups, another big problem was clotting. Anticoagulants were unknown at the time, and it was not until 1915 that sodium citrate came into popular use as an anticoagulant in transfusions.But Blundell knew that one way to decrease the danger of clotting was to speed things up and minimize the time blood remained outside the body. He devised a syringe with two heads and a valve lock, so you could do a phlebotomy on both donor and recipient in advance, draw the blood, flip the valve and then immediately transfuse it to the recipient. Of course, he still didn't know about blood groups, so incompatibility was a problem. It remained a risky procedure, but the patients were dying anyway from lack of blood, so that was some justification.Blundell produced many devices for facilitating blood transfusions and had them manufactured and sold, and became a rich man from these sales. So apparently there was market enough among other physicians experimenting with blood transfusions during this period (between the 1840's and the time *Dracula* was written). However, it was still very much an institutional thing, with some small number of hospitals where it was popular while the vast majority of physicians wanted nothing to do with it.The Edinburgh Royal Infirmary was one of the early institutions where blood transfusions became popular, and in the decade before *Dracula* they did a lot of transfusions which were widely reported in the press. Perhaps that's where Bram Stoker got the idea. He didn't seem to understand the mechanics though, because van Helsing's technique described in the book is very crude.Physicians of the time were certainly more sophisticated than that. Landois published a treatise in 1875 - *Die Transfusion des Blutes* - in which he reported that mixing blood cells from one species with serum from another often causes lysis in 2 minutes or less. This work was in fact the basis of Landsteiner's experiments which led to the discovery of blood groups. But ever since Landois' text, people knew that the incompatibility reaction was quite rapid, so it was standard practice in some institutions to start with a small transfusion and continue a few minutes later only if there were no adverse reactions.", "label": 0}, {"content": "In 1897, blood transfusions were carried out without any mention of compatible blood groups. This was because blood groups were not yet known and the practice was not regulated. The result of a blood transfusion was a risk of infection and death.", "label": 1}, {"content": "We have to readjust our mindsets a bit here: people didn't necessarily need to launder all of their clothes the way we do today. Instead, it was normal (for more than a thousand years - my knowledge isn't so encyclopedic before about 1500 or so, but I know of this tradition going back at least to the Anglo-Saxons) to wear a fairly plain garment under the clothing that could be seen, in order to protect it from the sweat and oil of the body. Men's shirts and women's shifts of the 18th century were made of linen, usually cut in fairly basic geometric shapes that made use of the woven selvage of the fabric to form unfrayable straight lines, and sewn together with firm stitches that would hold up to repeated rough laundering. [Shirts](_URL_0_) were made with a standing collar that protected the neckcloth, and sleeves that went to the wrist underneath a coat; women's [shifts](_URL_1_) instead had a lower neckline cut out of the body, to match the neckline created by the gown and stomacher worn throughout most of the century, and shift sleeves didn't go much past the elbow, as long sleeves were not typically worn by women.These pieces were made out of linen at all different levels of quality, from very fine and almost sheer cloth to unbleached tow that would have to be broken in somewhat through both laundering and repeated wear to be comfortable. These comprise some of the earliest types of ready-made clothes, since they didn't have to fit the body in a more than cursory way, though they were also often made at home by women who may not have had the skills to cut out the pieces for more close-fitting outerwear made from more expensive fabric, and could be bought at second-hand clothes dealers (who were plentiful in cities and cheap).In the early 19th century, cotton began to edge out linen as, very basically, cotton production was overtaking it. With slave labor and the cotton gin, the fluff itself was cheap and easy to process, while linen required \"retting\", i.e. being allowed to rot in water for a certain number of weeks, followed by a combing with metal \"heckles\". The American textile mills of this period were largely set up to deal with cotton, and those of England were trending that way themselves. Cotton then became cheaper than linen (though it had been affordable for a very long time already), and made more sense for use with these undergarments. There isn't a strict correlation, but as cotton became more commonly used this way, the cuts of the undergarments themselves changed to be less chary of waste. The \"Corazza shirt\" for men appeared in the 1840s; it was very different from the previous type, as it buttoned down the back and had an arrangement of pleats in the front, which likely is related to the growing trade in ready-made clothing that was more complex/difficult to make than those that were done at home. (Elizabeth Gaskell wrote of a woman dealing with \"the puzzle of devising how [Corazza shirts] were cut out\" in the 1851 *Mr Harrison's Confessions*.) Shifts - now called chemises - took on a number of different forms that often involved gathering to a yoke and the insertion of cheap machine-made laces or machine-embroidered ribbons. However, though they were fancier, they were still intended to be unseen and to be replaced and washed as needed.Okay, so, what does \"as needed\" mean? That's tricky, because we can't tell from the extant pieces of clothing, and it wasn't regularly discussed. In the early modern period, there's evidence that people began bathing less specifically because they could have more changes of linen, which took care of the issue. (See \"The Body, Appearance, and Sexuality\", by Sara Grieco in *A History of Women in the West: Renaissance and Enlightenment Paradoxes*, Harvard University Press, 1992, if you don't believe me.) Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, the ideal was to change at least every day, perhaps more often if one had gotten sweaty doing something physical or if the day were hot - having clean clothes made you more comfortable, obviously, and having crisp, fresh linen around the neckline of your clothes or peeking out from your sleeves was a symbol of both your social status and your moral standing - fiction and non-fiction of the 18th century takes note of the state of individuals' linen, drawing conclusions from the contradiction between someone's greasy, dirty shirt and other fine things they might have. Dirty linen was also thought to cause or attract illness by trapping impurities and \"poisons\" next to the skin.The majority of people had a decent number of changes of body linen in their wardrobes, because these items were a necessity. In late 18th century France, for instance, three-quarters of the people in the bourgeoisie and artisan classes owned between ten and thirty shirts or shifts. Garsault's 1771 *Art of the Linen-maker* described a noble trousseau containing *72* shifts, which would allow for multiple changes per day as well as several to wear while others were being laundered! The very poor, however, might own only two shirts/shifts, wearing one while the other aired out or sat - or just one, if they were truly destitute. Paupers were typically given an outfit containing only one shirt or chemise upon entering a charitable institution, and they would rewear them until given fresh ones; as the laundries in these places were often inadequate, the \"clean\" one might not be much better than the one they were already wearing.With outer clothing, there was not much objection to wearing the same thing repeatedly as there wasn't an implication that the proper laundry wasn't being done: the only issue might be that you appeared to have few items of clothing, which obviously would show your class/wealth. However, it's likewise difficult to say exactly how frequently individual coats, breeches/trousers, or gowns were worn, since inventories made after an individual's death rarely make it clear which clothing has been held onto for sentimental or other reasons, and which were actively being used. The 1747 inventory of the clothes and accessories of Mary Churchill, 2nd Duchess of Montagu, for instance, tells us a lot and a little. She had 25 shifts (probably all in regular use, since there would be little reason to hold onto worn-out ones) and 27 gowns of various fabrics, from seersucker to silk - were half for winter and half for summer? Were many held onto from her early life, or were they in regular rotation? We don't know. Barbara Johnson, an 18th century Englishwoman, kept an album with snippets of all of the fabric she purchased and had made up into clothing, usually with a note of the year and what was made, which is both useful and unuseful in a similar way: we can tell her habits of *consumption*, but not how often she got rid of or remodeled anything. When she bought two new mourning outfits in 1759, was she wearing those two day in and day out, or did she still have and use her mourning outfit from 1756, or the one from 1753, or even the ones from 1751?We do know that many people, particularly in the 19th century, might change their outer clothes more than once a day. To quote from [a recent answer of mine](_URL_2_): > The average man didn't really do any changes, while an affluent businessman might change out of his three-piece suit for dinner. For women, housedresses (loose, unlined, washable dresses) were very common during this time, and even an average woman would probably wear one while doing the housework to spare her normal clothing, which she could change into in the afternoon; moving up the social scale, an affluent woman might wear a housedress early in the morning, change into a different dress for the bulk of the day, and put on a dinner dress at night. Anything else would be put on on an as-needed basis, the same way that people do today - sports clothes for sports, riding clothes for riding, swimsuits, etc.", "label": 0}, {"content": "In the 1700s and 1800s, people changed their clothes every day.

The treaty stated it this way: > The inhabitants of the ceded territory shall be incorporated in the Union of the United States and admitted as soon as possible according to the principles of the federal Constitution to the enjoyment of all these rights, advantages and immunities of citizens of the United States, and in the mean time they shall be maintained and protected in the free enjoyment of their liberty, property and the Religion which they profess.Jefferson was famously concerned about the constitutionality of the executive branch acquiring territory. Very few shared this concern. There was more concern, however, about whether it was legal or ethical to annex territory without the consent of the territory\u2019s citizens.This issue was debated in Congress. John Quincy Adams argued that *\u201cwe ought to have applied to the inhabitants of Louisiana to recognize our right to govern them.\u201d* Few other congressmen agreed with him, it turned out. And in any case the debate was more about the abstract principle than the actual case with Louisiana, since it was assumed that *\u201cthe inhabitants would readily agree to the proposed transfer of their allegiance; [\u2026none could] be so unwise as to prefer being the colonists of a distant European Power, to being members of this immense Empire, with all the privileges of American citizens\u201d*, as Madison put it.Even so, it was not clear *how* this \u201ctransfer of allegiance\u201d would work. US politicians knew that Louisiana was effectively an imperial colony of foreigners. They differed over what ought to be done to \u201cAmericanize\u201d Louisiana. Many, including Jefferson, thought it was essential to \u201cdilute\u201d the population with American settlers and to apply some kind of acculturation pressure. Jefferson suggested annexing Lower Lousiana to Mississippi Territory, in order to mix its people *\u201cwith such a body of Americans as may take the lead in legislation and government\u201d.*That quickly proved impractical. Instead he divided Louisiana into two interim territories. The southern territory, which had about 50,000 inhabitants, mostly French-speaking, was made fairly large, to make it easier for American settlers to \u201cdilute\u201d or \u201cAmericanize\u201d the population.Most US leaders saw the people of Louisiana as foreigners, speaking a foreign language and adhering to a foreign culture. It was assumed that they were used to authoritative government. They followed strange legal customs and laws and would need help setting up American-style representative institutions. They would need a strong American governor and close federal supervision. Their laws, courts, etc, would have to be remade to conform with the American system. Louisiana followed the model of French and Spanish civil law, while English common law was the model in the rest of America. Americans generally assumed their system was superior and had to replace the civil law system in Louisiana.One obvious way to do all this was to encourage American settlement in Louisiana. Jefferson supported a bill that would pay for 30,000 Americans to settle in Louisiana. They would receive 160 acres of land and the government would pay for at least their transportation to Louisiana. The bill passed in the Senate, but stalled in the House.The people of Louisiana were, surprise surprise, not happy about these things. They had many grievances under the new territorial government. There was social unease and conflict. A delegation went to Washington to plead for immediate statehood and the preservation of at least some of Louisiana\u2019s laws and customs. Louisianians resisted most attempts to change their civil law system. They won a major victory in 1808 when the US formally recognized Louisiana\u2019s Digest of the Civil Laws, modeled on the Code Napol\u00e9on. The US also dropped its insistence on the use of English for all government business (the laws, for example, were printed in English and French).One aspect of American law that Louisianians *were* happy to adopt was trial by jury in criminal cases.Anyway, American feelings about this alien people they had annexed eased in the wake of the Burr Conspiracy. The French Louisianians were not at all implicated in the intrigues and suspected treasonous cabals. On the contrary, it was the allegiance of Americans in the region, not the French, that was concerning.In the changed political climate following the Burr Conspiracy Congress was much more willing to consider statehood for Louisiana. This reopened many debates, and many northern politicians spoke out against statehood, sometimes citing the unamericanness of the \u201cHispano-Gallo race\u201d (though slavery-related things were perhaps the main issues of debate). It took a few years, but Louisiana statehood was approved in 1811.Nevertheless, Louisiana retained the feel of being an imperial colony divided between the French inhabitants and a growing number of Americans. Over time the \u201cimperial\u201d aspect of Louisiana faded, but its \u201cunusual\u201d culture survived in many ways.To sum up, the annexation of Louisiana and its inhabitants was hugely significant. Neither America nor France had made the slightest gesture of interest in how the citizens of Louisiana felt about it. The Constitution said nothing whatever about such a case. It was, in effect, a sudden experiment in empire. Previously, Americans sometimes spoke of being an \u201cempire\u201d in a poetic, rhetorical sense. Now America was an empire in the real sense of having annexed peoples of foreign culture, who had not chosen to be Americans. Of course, Native Americans had long been exactly that, but had long been put aside as special case and not given citizenship. What was done to the French colonists of Louisiana was seen as something quite different and with the possibily of far-reaching consequences for the United States itself.Sourced mainly from *The Shaping of America, Volume 2*, D.W.

The process of demobilization in itself was not handled very efficiently and was instituted too quickly to be as effective as possible; only a single man, Colonel C.H. Conrad, was entrusted to form a plan, and he only started his work a month before the war ended. Four plans were initially considered;* Demobilization by length of service; men who had served the longest discharged first* Demobilization by civilian occupation; men most critical in their industry being discharged first * Demobilization by locality; men being sent to their local draft boards to be discharged* Demobilization by unitAfter mulling over the pros and cons of each (and seeing several in action), the fourth plan, demobilization by unit, was chosen. Including the several divisions serving as occupation forces in the Rhineland, all U.S. divisions were home by the summer of 1919, having traveled on one or several troopships or converted cruise liners as soon as they were available. A maximum of 102,000 men a week passed through demobilization centers on continental Europe by the middle of June 1919, and by August 1919, 80 percent of the troops in the \"emergency\" U.S. Army had begun the process of returning home.The U.S. Third Army, having been created to occupy the Rhineland, was disbanded on July 2, 1919 and renamed American Forces in Germany, and only a few thousand American troops remained there until 1923.The process of demobilization stateside occurred at designated camps throughout the United States which had previously been newly constructed to train the millions of draftee and volunteer troops in 1917 and 1918; many of these camps would later become the familiar forts of today's U.S. Army. Divisions of the Volunteer Army (National Army) and the National Guard of the United States had been raised from men that lived in groups of adjacent states, and an effort was made to demobilize these divisions at a camp which was closest to a place where most of the men lived (which was not necessarily the camps where the divisions were raised). Divisions were sometimes demobilized at a camp near a port of embarkation and the sub-units returned home individually, especially if they were explicitly state-based like National Guard units.**Regular Army Divisions**Division|Camp Mobilized At|Camp Demobilized at|Demobilized in U.S.:--|:--|:--|:--1st|Jay, NY|George G.

The  [National Defense Act of 1916](_URL_4_) prescribed several regulations on the wear of the military uniform. Soldiers were allowed to wear their uniforms for up to three months post-discharge. It was unlawful to wear the military uniform without the identifying mark (chevrons), if the soldier had received them. Unlawful wear of the military uniform or impersonation was punished by a fine of up to $300.00 and/or a jail sentence of up to six months. Under the Act, train tickets or other means of transportation were offered to enlisted soldiers at a fare of 3 1/2 cents per mile to their homes. Men were compelled to purchase tickets immediately after their arrival at the demobilization camp via only having a reduced rate (often 2 cents) offered there and at the date of discharge, and being marched directly to the ticket window after their arrival, to prevent them from lingering in urban areas and make them go home as quickly as possible. Meals could be had on trains for seventy-five cents. Soldiers could reasonably expect to be back at home within two or three weeks, even less if they lived next to the area where demobilization took place.Another result of demobilization was a flooding of the labor market; civilians in many towns and cities complained about the supposed large number of discharged soldiers in their communities looking for employment by January 1919 (the New York Employment Board claimed 25 to 30% of soldiers seeking jobs in the city had never lived there, but the real figure was 1.6%), and had to be reassured by the government.**Sources:**Clay, Steven E. *U.S. Army Order of Battle 1919-1941 Volume 1: The Arms: Major Commands and Infantry Organizations*.

Based on contemporary sources, including Polybius and Timaeus, modern historians agree that Roman involvement in Greece started with no intention toward conquest or empire-building; they were instead attempting to maintain the balance of power in the eastern Mediterranean and support their allies and trade partners during a period of unstable and unpredictable alliances and dependencies in the Hellenistic world.Hellenistic Greece was a loose alliance of independent city-states until it was united by Philip II of Macedon, father of Alexander the Great, in the 300s BCE. After Alexander\u2019s death, his vast empire was split into several warring factions. Foremost among these were Ptolemaic Egypt, the Seleucid Empire (based in modern-day Syria/Anatolia), and the Kingdom of Macedon, while the Greek city-states largely returned to self-rule. The Romans first entered conflict with Macedonia during the 2nd Punic War, when Philip V of Macedon allied himself with Rome\u2019s foremost rival for domination of the western Mediterranean, Carthage, and its great general Hannibal. Rome sent troops to Greece primarily to prevent the Macedonians from joining their armies to Hannibal\u2019s; the conflict was largely indecisive.Roman involvement in Greece began in earnest following the succession crisis in Ptolemaic Egypt. As Egypt fell into civil war, Macedon and the Seleucids entered an alliance to divide its territories between them. Fearing this powerful alliance, Roman allies in the Greek city-states of Pergamum and Rhodes sent ambassadors to the Roman Senate requesting intervention. Rome initially intervened diplomatically; when Philip of Macedon ignored the demands, the Romans sent a large army which decisively defeated the Macedonians. Rather than consolidating power in the region, the Romans declared the \u2018Freedom of the Greeks\u2019 and withdrew their forces.With Macedon and Egypt now weakened, the Seleucids were the major power in the eastern Mediterranean and sought to conquer Greece themselves. Once more Rome dispatched the legions to Greece, where they defeated the Seleucid forces decisively, pursuing them across the Aegean and into Anatolia.The Romans declared war on Macedon once more when Philip\u2019s son Perseus attempted to reassert Macedonian hegemony over Greece. The Roman legions defeated the now-outdated Macedonian phalanx; this time Rome divided Macedon into four client republics, establishing Rome\u2019s first permanent territory in Greece.Shortly thereafter, a pretender to the Macedonian throne attempting to reinstate the kingdom led to a fourth war in Macedon. This time the Achaean league, an alliance of Greek city-states centered around Corinth, joined the Macedonian side. The Roman legions once again resoundingly defeated the Greek forces, razing Corinth to the ground. This time the Romans decided to remain permanently, dividing the conquered territory into two new provinces: Epirus in the north and Achaea in the south.Even after the Battle of Corinth and establishment of Roman provinces in Greece, the region remained an alliance of largely independent city-states and kingdoms with varying degrees of independence from Rome. There were several uprisings against Roman hegemony, including one led by Athens that was crushed by the Roman general Sulla. This remained largely the status quo for the next two centuries until the establishment of the Roman Empire, when the region was reorganized into provinces explicitly under Rome\u2019s control.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Romans had a long history of conflict with the Greeks, and the Romans had a long history of conflict with the Greeks.

However, that being said, I will attempt to answer in general about European immigration to the United States in the 19th century because I've been teaching subjects like this for nearly a decade. This answer is general and wide-ranging and not an in-depth look at Norwegians as immigrants, per se. Think of it as a Freshman-level survey lecture. One final disclaimer that, I think, fits with any question about historical motivations and actions; \"It's complicated.\"With those out of the way, let's delve a little into the phenomena of American migration and the immigrant story as a whole:* Immigration to the United States was the product of \"boosterism\"Basically, both officials from the US government and citizens alike 'sold' life in the United States as a golden opportunity. Mind you, this was not unique to the United States itself; the [British government used to advertise owning farms and land and opportunity in Canada] (_URL_7_) to the swelling populations of the 19th century. In fact, some have argued that ['transportation'] (_URL_8_) to Australia was also a release valve for excess population. Essentially, there was a wide-ranging 'sales' pitch to draw Europeans (and Asians) to \"The West\" (a vague, wide term that includes many places we would not think of as 'western' today.) A good example of this sales pitch, though coming at the tail end of the 19th century, is the adventuresome [\"dime novels\"] (_URL_4_) which, tall tales aside, painted the West as an empty land ready for exploitation. Newspaper reporters and fiction writers alike jumped upon the bandwagon of these tales because appetite for them in Europe pretty much guaranteed newspaper sales (and writers' incomes). Moreover, and perhaps more famously, [\"Buffalo Bill's Wild West Shows\"] (_URL_1_) romanticized America to the European market; America was a place where a man could prove his manliness through near-mythical deeds! He was immensely popular and his act performed for Queen Victoria and the Pope by the end of the 19th century. Can't imagine getting swept up in the fever of a new land? Well, imagine if a newssite broke the story of a previously-unknown continent that was 'empty' and ready for settling. A place where you could start a new life with a new name and a new identity. How many 21st century Americans themselves would leap at the chance to abandon debt, shitty credit scores, acrimonious politics, social inequality, economic disparity, and the banal evils of corporate life for an opportunity for adventure and excitement?Add to this stories of immigrants who 'made it' in the USA - people like [Levi Strauss] (_URL_5_), [Andrew Carnegie] (_URL_0_), and [Adolphus Busch] (_URL_3_) - and you have a powerful incentive to risk literally everything in a voyage to the USA and traversing unknown regions of a dangerous continent.* Free land/cheap land is better than expensive land/hereditary land.Unlike Europe, the Canadian/American West had lots of 'unused' land, according to boosters (please know it certianly wasn't \"empty\" nor \"unused\" but that's a different conversation). This goes hand-in-hand with the above point; it was a tradition in North America to offer cheap or free land to entice Europeans over to the New World, but these (such as the Headright acts in 1600s Virginia) were met with mixed results. The difference between 1600 and 1800 boils down to changes in agriculture and medicine in Europe which led to higher populations and over-crowding of the land and cities. This, in turn, led to high land and property prices (as well as taxes) for new families, meaning many people's dreams of having their own farm/land/business would always be a 'dream.'Comparatively, the US government offered free land periodically through things like the Homestead Act of 1862 which opened up millions of acres of land for a pittance in order to get European (read \"White Europeans\" from North and West Europe) and American presences in the region; this would lead to settled farmers producing food and forcing out the Native Americans whose land it really was (though the US gov't conveniently neglected to tell Europeans as such). About 1.5 million homesteaders, not all of whom were US citizens by birth, took up the offer of free or nearly-free land during the lifetime of the Act and its 'spin offs' (smaller, more regional acts that hoped to have the same draw) continued well into the 20th century, drawing people to places like Nebraska. Best of all, taxes - if they existed at all in the region - were miniscule compared to Europe. Free land and no taxes? Sign me up, right?So, Europeans had a choice; stay and maybe scrape enough together to maybe afford some land or sell pretty much everything and take a gamble on snagging some 'free' land.* Europeans were politically convulsedWhile not quite as applicable to Scandinavians, most of Europe at the time was going through some pretty scary political, social, and economic upheavals that made staying in Europe in the mid-19th century particularly dicey. German, Italian, Irish, Polish, and many other Europeans were faced with [political revolution, unemployment, and literal starvation] (_URL_6_) in the mid-19th century. The option then was to stay and maybe die or to take a gamble and maybe live. A good example is the Potato Blight which most famously affected the Irish (leading to over half the population dying or fleeing to foreign shores), but Germany and Belgium were also affected deeply, especially the poor and working class whose diet was extremely dependent upon the humble spud. Comparatively, with the exception of 1860 to 1865, the United States seemed relatively stable and prosperous.Stay and die or move and live (probably)? Which would you choose?* Relatives and community were already here in some cases.Only a relative few immigrants 'blazed the trail' so to speak. Many were enticed to come to the USA by relatives and friends who had gone before. Immigrant communities - speaking their mother tongue primarily (or exclusively) - were common in the \"West.\" Many frontier cities had newspapers and laws passed in the mother tongue, despite being in the USA. Why? Comfort and familiarity. Immigrants banded together in order to look out for each other and provide a sense of continuity and 'normalcy' to their new lives. Larger communities drew more people and made possible more success stories. Usually, more immigrants settled relatively stable areas and only the truly desperate or foolhardy settled 'frontiers.'I like your term \"unbuilt\"; the immigrant experience allows the newcomer to craft a world closer to their liking. It gave immigrants agency in crafting their future; a world that had all the good stuff of the homeland and all the stuff they liked about the new place. This is something they could never really have done even in the most liberal of European countries. Interestingly, the act of \"building\" reinforced cooperation and community while, ironically, perpetuating the myth of rugged individualism and made the transition from settled Europe to 'unbuilt' USA more palatable and less scary.In conclusion, there are a LOT of reasons why a Norwegian would come out to the badlands of the West and persevere in the face of such hardships. But a combination of sales pitch, free land, a desire to remake the world as you see fit, and the lure of 'making it' all combine into a rather powerful impulse to \"go to such a far distance.\"Sources:*Unfinished Nation: A Concise History of the American People* by Alan Brinkley 2014*Immigrant America: A Portrait* by Alejandro Portes et. al 2006*Norwegians and Swedes In America: Friends and Neighbors* Ed by Philip Anderson et. al. 2012*Immigrants in the American Civil War* History channel, American History in Film database, 2008[The Buffalo Bill Center of the West] (_URL_9_)[Library of Congress: The Homestead Act] (_URL_2_)EDIT: Spelling mistakes here and there (how did you guys let me get away with that?)", "label": 0}, {"content": "The family of Norwegians in the Netflix series \"Godless\" are all the way out in the American frontier in the 1800s.

It continued, however, to preserve many of the cultural traditions, some of the institutions, and one of the great cities of the Roman world. In the second century, the Roman provinces that made up the future heart of the Byzantine world were linguistically divided. In the Balkans, heavily influenced by the legions along the Danube, the lingua franca was Latin. Greece and Asia Minor, however, were almost entirely Greek-speaking. A Roman time-traveler to the Byzantine world would find that Greek (albeit a very different-sounding Greek) had persisted in Greece and Asia Minor, but that Slavic languages had replaced Latin in the Balkans. He would also discover that - despite a modest tenth- and eleventh-century revival in Byzantine legal circles - knowledge of Latin had virtually disappeared. But if, like many educated Romans, he was a fluent reader of Greek, he would be gratified to find that knowledge of the Greek classics was alive and well among the Byzantine elite, and that many Byzantine authors continued to use a classicizing literary style quite similar to that employed by educated speakers of his own day. If a Roman time traveler found himself in court, he would also discover that Byzantine civil law was still based on the Code of Justinian (and thus on the legal traditions of his own day). That law had of course been translated into Greek, and modified by the various later compilations; but it was very clearly, and proudly, part of the Roman legal tradition. A visit to the imperial palace, with its cadres of officials and pneumatic throne, might disconcert a time traveler accustomed to the pseudo-republican governing style of Trajan or Hadrian. The autocratic and bureaucratic Byzantine court, however, was far from being un-Roman; it just late Roman, based on a model of imperial rule pioneered by Diocletian and Constantine. Perhaps the most impressive demonstration the Byzantines were still Romans, however, was the city of Constantinople itself. Before it was burned and pillaged by the crusaders, Constantinople - alone among the cities of the medieval Mediterranean world - continued to look like a classical city.

Throughout most of the Middle Ages though, it wasn't mandatory at all. Mandatory church attendance is a Reformation thing -- Calvin supposedly was the first to put pews/ seats into his churches in Geneva so it would be easier to spot who was there and to make it socially harder for people to get up and leave in the middle of the service. Until then -- and this is difficult to envision nowadays -- the naves of churches were nearly empty. There was no seating at all. Services would be going on at the main altar or in side chapels and the rest of the church would either be (a) empty, or (b) filled with people just milling around. Pilgrims might be visiting shrines, beggars would be asking for charity, townsfolk would be conducting business or just chatting with others or looking on curiously at what was going on at the altars around them -- in a language they didn't speak (Latin), with the priests having their backs turned to the crowd and saying the mass softly but intently to no one in particular. Through most of the Middle Ages, services were held by and for those who had a connection to God (priests, other religious, certain parts of the high aristocracy, etc.). The rest of the population was unimportant to the process of the mass - the conversation was between God and those who could talk to him and services were performed, like under the Israelites in the Old Testament, so that God would look kindly on the whole community. An individual's relationship with God was irrelevant, inconceivable, until the late Middle Ages (at the earliest).

Over the following century and a half, enthusiasts fill in the gaps in the primary source to try to explain it, and it enters the realm of myth and folklore. I think the same process has occurred with the Dyatlov Pass incident. There wasn't sufficient data recorded due to the remote and inhospitable region of the incident, leading to an unknowable \"crime scene\" in which too much information had already decayed or been lost.

This is my first time answering a post on Askhistorians, so I'll do my best and hopefully can edit if it gets flagged by the mods.Before addressing the historical issue of the adoption of the printing press in regions where the Arabic alphabet is used, I'd like to briefly outline the actual technological aspects. By printing press I'm going to assume you mean specifically letterpress printing (the sort Gutenberg used) with moveable type, which is where the question of connected lettering gets interesting since as you you point out, each letter of the Arabic alphabet can vary its shape and design based on whether it is an initial, medial, or final letter. This might suggest that the issue of printing with Arabic alphabets was merely a matter of cutting more matrices (thing which are used to cast type) and casting more type. Viewed in this light, printing in Arabic might seem to just pose an economic concern or maybe one of practicality as opposed to technological capability. We should also note that Arabic, being an inherently cursive script, used ligatures, and lots of them. Ligatures are where two or even three letters combined to produce a slightly different letter shape. Like with the connected alphabet design inherent in Arabic, ligatures added to the numbers of type that would need to be cast. But Latin used ligatures too. [This image](_URL_2_) reproduces Gutenberg's letter forms, a total of 292.All that said, I don't want to dismiss the issue of the cost of producing type as a matter that printers were concerned about. At the end of the day, books were objects to be sold. Unlike scribes who produced manuscripts and received part of their commission upfront, a printer in the Early Modern period fronted the cost of producing a book (including paying all those people who set and align type, it was a complicated endeavor) and so a printer had to balance the risk of books not selling well to the cost that went into producing all these unsold books. So, cost mattered.The 'invention' of printing with Arabic moveable type found its home in Italy in the 16th century. The first book is widely believed to be a devotional book of hours printed in 1514 in Fano (although people argue it's more likely it was printed in Venice), likely intended for Arabic-speaking Christians living in the Levant.  A number of other books printed in Arabic appeared at this time in Italy, but the most organized and well funded efforts were around 1584 with the founding of the Medici Oriental Press in Rome (which later moved to Florence). Pope Gregory XIII even contributed to the press' establishment. A key element in why the books this press produced were much 'better' looking Arabic scripts, compared to previous efforts, lay in the skill of its typographer Robert Granjon, whose fonts we still use today. Granjon produced hundreds of ligatures, which together made a far more elegant, neater looking script. You can see a Google books scan of the press' version of Ibn Sina's Canon [here](_URL_0_). So for all intents and purposes, after the Medici Oriental Press, the issue of printing in Arabic was no longer a 'technological' matter so much as it was whether there was interest in these books. Presses in Leiden and England appeared not long after, some even borrowed the types that were made for the Medici Press in Rome. The question of why European scholars took an interest in learning Arabic again in the Early Modern period (don't forget the Medieval translation movements of the 10th - 12th centuries to translate Arabic works into Latin) is important to this issue of Arabic printing. I won't go into too much detail, but the combined effects of renewed interest in Arabic translations of classical Greek authors (and their Arab commentators like Ibn Rushd and Ibn Sina), the Catholic Church's efforts to reconnect with the Arabic speaking Christians I mentioned above, and the growing relevance of their Ottoman neighbors to the East (who spoke Turkish but also used Arabic for their scholarly productions) all led to a kind of second-wave interest in Arabic in the early modern period. I'll list some books below if you're interested.Finally, as to the question of whether it 'delayed' the introduction of the printing presses in regions which used Arabic alphabets. I'm trained as an Ottomanist, so I'll focus on that region. As I've tried to suggest above, the technological difficulties of a connected, cursive language were overcome soon enough. The printing press wasn't delayed in being adopted beyond a specific European locale for any such technological reasons or for lack of awareness. The Ottomans were well aware of printing technologies. We read some of their criticisms as to its inaccuracies, and their distaste over it being possibly used to print Qur'ans. But Greek and Jewish communities living in Istanbul established printing presses much earlier than the first 'Ottoman' (by which we're insinuating 'Turkish' or 'Muslim') press founded by Ibrahim Muteferrika in 1729. The issue of why Ottomans did not adopt printing presses sooner, but did do so for other European technologies, is a complicated one that I don't personally think has been fully answered by the scholarship. One theory has to do with the strength of the scribal classes in opposing a technology that could threaten the means of their livelihood, but I think that's only partly there. I'm an Early Modernist so I won't wade into why printing presses were eventually established in places like Cairo in the 18th century, but I would caution you against viewing its adoption as a teleological necessity or as being 'late' compared to Europe. In my own work, I encounter Ottoman translations of European printed books all the time and its not seen as some novel thing, just an alternate form of textual transmission.You can read a bit more about the early history of Arabic printing in Europe in my blog post [here](_URL_1_) (with linked sources and more pictures).Books:*The Republic of Arabic Letters* by Alexander Bevilacqua*The 'Arabick' interest of the natural philosophers in seventeenth-century England* edited by G.

Unfortunately, I cannot comment on the equipment of western European armies. In terms of time period, the sources I am pulling from are the *Taktika* of Nikephoros Ouranos, written in the early 11th century and the  *Praecepta militaria* of Nikephoros Phokas, written in the 10th century, All quotes and information below are from *Praecepta militaria* and *Taktika*. At the time of the Taktika, there are 7 types of soldiers outlined in the text. Foot soldiers, archers, javeliners, slingers, menavlatoi, kataphraktoi and prokoursatores. **Foot soldiers*** short tunics extending to the knees, of cotton or coarse silk; * short boots folded up to the knees or unfolded up to the thighs; * thick caps of felt fastened over their heads with bands of cloth, * sword, axe, or iron mace. Stored at the waste on a belt. * sling stored in the belt. * Shields no smaller than six spithamai, larger if possible* thick and solid spears, from twenty-five to thirty spithamai in length. Nikephoros Ouranos: \"Their points and fastenings should be fit for the task.\"**Archers*** fifty arrows each in their quivers* two bows* small shields* extra bowstrings* swords or axes* slingsNeither *Praecepta militaria* nor *Taktika* gets into the equipment of the slingers and javeliners, only their tasks and positioning. Archers and spearmen were the primary infantry force and the slingers and javeliners only had a supporting function. This is one explanation as to why their equipment is not detailed. **Menavlatoi**, the Menavlatoi are an interesting type of soldier and their equipment is hotly debated. The text states: \"[the Menavlatoi] must have thick menavlia with a length of one and a half or two ourguia while their points must have a length of one and a half or two spithamai, so that, when battle begins, the units will calmly move out through the intervals and engage the enemy.\". The maneuver Nikephoros Phokas is describing is when heavy cavalry are preparing for a charge against the Byzantine formation, the Menavlatoi take position in front of an extra rank of spearmen (for a total of 3 ranks of spears + 1 rank of Menavlatoi) to stand firm against the cavalry charge. Their purpose, along with the description points to some type of pike or halberd, maybe a bill sort of weapon. Regardless of what it was, it was the front line of defense against a heavy cavalry charge. Nikephoros Phokas continues: \"All the javeliners and menavlatoi should have shields smaller than those of the [foot soldiers]\". \"Their menavla must not be made from wood cut into sections but from saplings of oak, cornel, the so called artzekidia, of from another hard wood. if trees in one piece cannot be found, let these menavla be made from trees cut into sections, but they have to be of hard wood and as thick as hands can wield\". **Prokoursatores** are light horsemen and Nikephoros Phokas states, \"must be proficient archers\". Nikephoros Phokas does not go into their equipment with much detail but we do know a few things:* klibania* helmets or lorikia* swords or maces* Bow and arrows are not mentioned, but \"proficient archers\" infers they are armed in such a fasion. **kataphraktoi** or lancers. These are heavy cavalry, an equivalent to a medieval knight although the rider and mount wear considerable armor. * shields, more modest than those of the heavy infantry. Of either four or five spithamai. * klibania with sleeves down to the elbows. * arm guards and leg guards of chainmail, coarse silk or cotton. * Over their klibania they should wear epilorika or a shirt of coarse silk or cotton. * Iron helmets which cover their faces with chainmail, two or three layers thick so that only their eyes appear. * The horses must also be armored, either pieces of felt and boiled leather fastened together down to the knees so that nothing of the horse's body appears except its eyes and nostrils likewise their legs below the knees and their undersides should remain uncovered. * The horses can also have klibania made of bison hides split at the legs so that movement is not impaired. * swords* maces with all iron heads, three, four or six corner varieties with sharp corners. * lances**definitions:*** klibania: waist length curiass, usually of scale armor* lorikion: waist length mail shirt worn with padding* ourguia: unit of measure, about 1.8 meters* spithamai: unit of measure, ~24 centimeters**Edit based on /u/Alpy94 's clarification**The Byzantines of this period fought in a square formation where infantry of all the types described above worked together to form a mobile base for cavalry based attacks. The formations consisted of 12 units, three per facing. The units were spaced out such that cavalry could move freely into and out of the square as the battle required. Each unit consisted of 2 ranks of foot soldiers or \"hoplites\", 3 ranks of archers, then 2 ranks of foot soldiers. In the event of a frontal attack, one of the rear ranks of foot soldiers could move to the front of the unit. In the event of a cavalry charge, Menavlatoi in reserve would also move forward changing the formation to:* Menavlatoi* Foot soldiers* Foot soldiers* Foot soldiers* Archers* Archers* Archers* Foot soldiersAfter the charge connected, the javeliners and slingers in reserve would assist in driving the attackers away. To quote the text directly,  >  The formation of the infantrymen under discussion is to be a double-ribbed square, thus called \"a four-sided formation\" by the ancients, which has three units on each side so that all together there are twelve units on the four sides. They must be set apart, to the extent possible, to allow space for twelve to fifteen cavalrymen in each interval so that the combatants can move in and out.In each interval was a unit of javeliners, slingers, archers, and Manavlatoi who are tasked with driving back any attacks into said intervals. The structure of each unit is described as folows: >  The taxiarchs are to have under their command four hundred heavy infantry and three hundred bowmen, so as to make up one taxiarchy, which, as explained above, is double-faced, keeping two infrantrymen in the front and two in the back, three bowmen must be stationed between them in order to make up one division out of the twelve divisions. The taxiarchs should have another three hundred men to make a full complement of one thousand, of whom two hundred are javeliners and slingers and one hundred [Menavlatoi]. As far as the cavalry the light (prokoursatores) and heavy (kataphraktoi) are divided into banda of fifty men, each led by a droungarious. The cavalry units were more homogenous but not entirely so. The prokoursatores operated together, as scouts, skirmishers, and to pursue fleeing enemies. The kataphraktoi were deployed in a triangular formation described in great detail by the sources. (Seriously, they go on about it for pages and pages). The general idea of the cavalry triangle is as follows, * first four lines were to be composed of kataphraktoi with iron maces* from the fifth row to the twelfth, the outer kataphraktoi on either side were armed alternating with lances or maces/sabers. * from the fifth row to the twelfth, in the middle of the formation, were mounted archers* the formation's first row consists of twenty men, and increments by four each rank. e.g. 20, 24, 28 etc. for a total of 504. Of the 504, 150 should be archers. I have taken some pictures of diagrams I hope will be helpful and uploaded them [here](_URL_0_)In conclusion, this is only one example from the Medieval period but I hope it illustrates that Byzantine armies were organized in rather complex ways and while certain units may have been homogeneous for specific purposes, many were not. The sources emphasize the army working together as a formation, rather than individual units segregated by equipment functioning independently. **Sources:***Praecepta militaria* Nikephoros II Phokas*Taktika* Nikephoros Ouranos*Sowing the Dragon's Teeth* Eric McGeer**edited again for clarity****My first gold!

As Liberson argues: > In fact, as we shall see, the timing of this development suggests an influence stemming from the intense social and political changes beginning in the 1960s, a period marked by intensified African-American social protest, the development of the Black Power movement, a renewed emphasis on a distinctive and valued African-American culture, and black separatism.^1He cites one specific example: by 1989 in Illinois, 29% of girls born to African Americans and 16% of boys had unique names, compared to just 5% of white girls and 3% of white boys.^2As far as where the names come from, Islamic culture was a big influence (e.g. with Cassius Clay -- >  Muhammad Ali).  In addition, things like *Roots* were also an influence: the year the show aired (1977), Kizzy (one of the characters) was the 17th most-common name among African American girls (again in Illinois).^3  He also suggests that [Marcus Garvey](_URL_1_) was an influence for the name \"Marcus\" becoming more popular; the name was 164th in popularity for black males born in 1956, but was 5th by 1983.^4  Given the timing (Garvey died in 1940), this makes me think its popularity ties back in with the political changes described above.He later notes the increase (around this same timeframe) of names beginning with *La*.  He argues that a couple things account for this: the overall rise in unique names means new patterns will emerge, plus the *La-* names tended to be based on already-popular names.^5  But this is the result, rather than the cause, of African Americans' greater propensity to choose unique names.Later, he notes an interesting difference in Black vs. White girls' names in Augusta, Georgia in 1937: Black girls' names were far more likely to end in a vowel, and may have been a more nickname-type form.  He argues that this could be because it was common during this time to refer to Blacks by their first name, and that \"names with vowel endings, particularly nicknames ending with *ee*, are often less assertive and carry a childlike connotation.\"  He also notes that using nicknames implies a degree of intimacy and \"less social distance,\" and so Blacks' maintaining use of nicknames for longer showed a societal pressure to diminish them.^6Ultimately, he argues that Black names reflected race relations, \"both *actual* and *ideological*, from the earliest forced migration under slavery through today.\"^7*edit for typo, thanks to /u/GoodGuyGoodGuy*---^1 Stanley Lieberson, *A Matter of Taste: How Names, Fashions, and Culture Change* [at 76](_URL_0_).^2 *Ibid.*^3 *Ibid.*^4 *Id.* at 77.^5 *Id.* at 122-126.^6 *Id.* at 207.^7 *Ibid.*(Apologies for using legal-style citation, but it's what's ingrained at this point.)", "label": 0}, {"content": "In the United States, the name Jaquan was first used in the early 20th century, and was a popular name for boys in the 1920s and 1930s.

When this took place, the horse (weighing on average 1,300 pounds) would have to be helped to its feet, which was no mean feat. If injured badly, a fallen horse would be shot on the spot or simply abandoned to die, creating an obstruction that clogged streets and brought traffic to a halt. Dead horses were extremely unwieldy, and although special horse removal vehicles were employed, the technology of the era could not easily move such a burden. As a result, street cleaners often waited for the corpses to putrefy so they could more easily be sawed into pieces and carted off. Thus the corpses rotted in the streets, sometimes for days, with less than appealing consequences for traffic circulation, aesthetics, and public health.Article references: * Clay McShane.

Furthermore, I am going to focus largely on England, though many of the things I say below apply also to France, the Netherlands and some of the German Kingdoms/territories. The short answer is between the mid-seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries (1650-1700). The idea that women were more sexually aggressive seems to be quite an old one, and is related to the (European) idea that a woman's orgasm was necessary for conception. Indeed, the very misogynistic rationalization of the idea was, essentially \"all human sin derived ultimately from the original weakness of Eve, the first woman, and the pollution of sex was but one manifestation of this.\" Indeed, the very famous diarist, Samuel Pepys, after orgasming with an illicit lover was terrified that he might have made her orgasm as well....until her tone of voice assured him she had not (heh).Another example, and one of the rare surviing female accounts comes from Anna Harrison, a maid, who also saw men on the side to supplement her income. When a man penatrated her she would say: > Pray, make haste make haste make haste! I am afraid that you should get me with child...no, no I must take care [not to orgasm], 'tis a troublesome thing to have a child and no father who owns it.Though, of course, the historical record contemporary opinions about sexual desire is overwhelmingly male, a large part of the surviving record expresses a sort of fear/repulsion of women and their sexual desire. One such example is Nashe's [*A Choice of Valentines* aka *Nashe's Dildoe*](_URL_2_)The poem, of course describes a man who goes to see a woman he loves in a brothel and pays a heavy price to see her, whereupon he prematurely ejaculates. The woman manages to coax him 'back to life,' and appears to climax with him, but comments that she is unsatisfied, using a dildo to satisfy herself. The poem finishes with a long description of this dildo, full of anxiety, repulsion and attraction\u2014the woman has replaced him in the most primal sense: > My little dildoe shall supply your kind,\tA youth that is as light as leaves in wind:\tHe bendeth not, nor foldeth any deal,\t        But stands as stiff as he were made of steel;\t(And plays at peacock twixt my legs right blithe\tAnd doeth my tickling swage with many a sigh;)\tAnd when I will, he doth refresh me well,\tAnd never makes my tender belly swell.\u201d\t        Poor Priapus **[penis]**, thy kingdom needs must fall,\tExcept thou thrust thus weakling to the wall;\tBehold how he usurps in bed and bower, > ... > (Curse Eunuch dildo, senseless counterfeit,\t > Who sooth may fill, but never can beget...---------------------------------------The biggest reason the shift happened was, as Thomas Laqueur argues (and I agree), in the mid-1600s and through the 1700s there was a shift in thinking about gender. Before the Enlightenment, men and women were seen as two sides of one sex--it was generally held that both genders had the same anatomical make up. It was believed that a man could 'revert' or descend to being a woman if he was too feminine, and that a woman could become manly and grow a penis. There was a great fear among moralists of these 'hermaphrodittii'. (And, for this reason there were many laws in European countries against a man or a woman wearing the clothes of the opposite gender). Laqueur cites many reasons for the shift, including a formalizing medical field, cultural and societal shifts: > the rise of evangelical religion, Enlightenment political theory, the development of new sorts of public spaces, Lockean ideas of marriage as a contract, the cataclysmic possibilities of social change wrought by the french revolution, post-revolutionary conservatism, post-revolutionary feminism [and so on].After the mid-1700s, the emphasis on physical differences became more pronounced than the idea that there were essentially only one sex. Coupling these shifts was the rise of the libertine, or libertinism in England and France. These libertines were often very young and sexually aggressive males who lived in a society that trivalized sexual violence against females. Here's Pepys again, talking about the wife of one of his servants: > Tuesday 15 November 1664:  I to the \u2018Change, and thence Bagwell\u2019s wife with much ado followed me through Moorfields to a blind alehouse, and there I did caress her and eat and drink, and many hard looks and sooth the poor wretch did give me, and I think verily was troubled at what I did, but at last after many protestings by degrees I did arrive at what I would, with great pleasure > Tuesday 20 December 1664: After dinner I found occasion of sending him [my servant] abroad, and then alone \u2018avec elleMrs Bagwell je tentais a faire ce que je voudrais et contre sa force je le faisais biens que passe a mon contentment\u2019 [Alone with her I attempted to do that which I wanted, and against her resistance I achieved it: It went well, to my content.]And there are several more incidents. Though rape was a capital offence, many women would not report or admit what had happened, for fear of being tainted with the onus of a defiled woman, or even being accused of being the initiator. Several reform societies, the most influential of which was the Society for the Reformation of Manners succeeded in pushing this cultural shift into gradual acceptance by targeting libertinism and the men who visited prostitutes. This, more than anything else, helped convince the general public that men, not women were the sexual aggressors.So the longer answer is that, between 1650 and the early 1700s, a shift in how Europeans looked at gender occurred, caused by many reasons. At the same time, the philosophy of libertinism and encouragement of male sexual rapacity developed, especially among upper-class men. These two developments were targeted by moral reform societies that articulated a belief that the devil was channeled through men, not women. It was no longer believed that Eve brought sexual pollution into the world. *Sources*Nashe's Dildo: _URL_0_Pepys' Diary: _URL_1_The Origins of Sex, Faramerz DabhoiwallaAristotles Master-PieceMaking Sex: Body and Gender from the Greeks to Freud - Thomas Laqueur", "label": 0}, {"content": "In the Middle Ages women were considered temptresses and more prone to induce sexual desire.

To begin with, let's just quickly go over 'what Shakespeare was getting at'. This line is pretty frequently over-interpreted so that it is taken to mean that it is obliquely suggesting a lawyer's position in society is integral to upholding the peace. Our ragamuffin crew are talking about staging a revolution, and some have taken Dick the Butcher's line to suggest that one of the things standing in the way of their proposed revolution is lawyers, thereby praising their role as protecting citizens from upheaval. This is pretty unlikely, given that Shakespeare was as keen as the next person on a good old fashioned lawyer joke. & nbsp;Characterising lawyers as tedious, money-grabbing, pedantic, over-paid and favouring the demands of the rich over genuine justice is not even remotely new, and that appears to be what Shakespeare is doing here. To put the quotation in a bit more context, prior to the conversation about lawyers Jack Cade is talking up his suitability as ruler. He is claiming noble heritage, while Smith and Dick the Butcher snigger at him in asides to the audience: & nbsp;**Jack Cade.** My father was a Mortimer,\u2014  **Dick the Butcher.** [Aside] He was an honest man, and a good  bricklayer.  **Jack Cade.** My mother a Plantagenet,\u2014  **Dick the Butcher.** [Aside] I knew her well; she was a midwife.  **Jack Cade.** My wife descended of the Lacies,\u2014  **Dick the Butcher.** [Aside] She was, indeed, a pedler's daughter, and  sold many laces.     & nbsp;We then get the conversation about lawyers, as Jack describes the ideal society he will build: & nbsp;**Jack Cade.** Be brave, then; for your captain is brave, and vows  reformation. There shall be in England seven   halfpenny loaves sold for a penny: the three-hooped   pot; shall have ten hoops and I will make it felony  to drink small beer: all the realm shall be in   common; and in Cheapside shall my palfrey go to   grass: and when I am king, as king I will be,\u2014  **All.** God save your majesty!  **Jack Cade.** I thank you, good people: there shall be no money;  all shall eat and drink on my score; and I will   apparel them all in one livery, that they may agree   like brothers and worship me their lord.  **Dick the Butcher.** The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.   & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Henry VI, Act 4, Sc 2. & nbsp;The audience is already primed that Dick is playing for laughs. Presented with Jack's utopian ideal, Dick's first thought about the best way to enact a utopia is to kill all lawyers (badum-tish). & nbsp;This kind of joke turns up elsewhere in Shakespeare's plays, and it is pretty reasonable to assume that 'let's kill all lawyers' is intended to be funny, not serious. Mercutio's 'Queen Mab' speech in *Romeo and Juliet* mentions 'lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees', and Act 1 Sc 4 of *King Lear* has Kent say 'this is nothing, Fool' only for the Fool to reply, 'Then \u2019tis like the breath of an unfee\u2019d lawyer. You gave me nothing for \u2019t' (i.e. an unpaid lawyer won't say anything). & nbsp;As for whether your average Elizabethan playgoer would get the joke - it seems pretty likely. These kinds of wisecracks about lawyers have cultural relevance outside of Shakespeare. My own area of research is focused on epitaphs, and I have found some contemporary examples of epitaphs copied into manuscripts making jokes at the expense of the legal profession. See for example: & nbsp;Vpon Mister I. H. a Counsellor of Lincolnes Inne./Here lyes a Lawyer, who till his tyme of dying  did gayne much mony by his vse of lying  Liuing he ly\u2019d; and dead he lyes you see  within his graue, where let him lye for mee./   & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; & nbsp; Cambridge University Library, Additional Manuscript 4138, f52r & nbsp;'Occupational' epitaphs are a whole subgenre where the deceased is characterised by their profession (it includes one about a locksmith who picks the lock to heaven's gate rather than be let in, and a bellows mender who runs out of breath, for example). The avariciousness and untruthfulness of lawyers is seen by this writer as to be so characteristic that it is the best way to lampoon 'Mister I. H.' (whoever he may be!). & nbsp;[EDIT: Thanks /u/chikindiner for pointing out that I had the wrong source here. It's now corrected.] Philip Stubbes' *Anatomy of Abuses* (1583) gives the following description of lawyers in a section entitled 'English Lawyers are Rogues', he writes,  & nbsp; >  [Lawyers] handle poore mens matters coldly, they execute iustice parcially,  &  they receiue bribes greedily, so that iustice is peruerted, the poore beggared, and many a good man iniured therby. They respect the persons, and not the causes; mony, not the poore; rewards, and not conscience. So that law is turned almost topsie turuie, and therefore happy is he that hath least to doe with them. & nbsp;This type of commentary about lawyers was common enough to not only see print, but was common enough to be copied into personal manuscripts as a joke, and to be used as the foundation of a number of jokes on the Elizabethan stage. The line would likely have gotten a good chuckle out of the audience at the time. & nbsp;Hope this answers your question, do let me know if you have any questions!  edit: formatting goof  edit again: Thanks so much for the gold, stranger.

Japanese scholar Sabur\u014d Ienaga describes what happened to civilians when fighting reached what he describes as \"non-combatant residential areas\". From reading his book , it seems to me that masse shootings of civilians were not the primary \"atrocity of choice\". Rather, civilians were mostly forced to give up supplies to the army and commit suicide (an honorable death). Violators *were* shot, though, but it's not as if the military just decided to kill everyone themselves, from the first. Small difference to the locals, I imagine.Civilians used by Allied troops to parlay with the Japanese were also killed. Some locals were even prevented from picking their own gardens. Okinawa wasn't the only place to see this kind of behavior, either. For instance, on Saipan the U.S. advance in one area forced Japanese civilians to a cliff. The Japanese military ordered them to commit suicide by jumping off in full sight of U.S. troops.Back to Okinawa, though, and Sabur\u014d Ienaga: >  Garrison commander Akamatsu Yoshitsugu of Tokashikijima, Kerama archipelago, Okinawa ordered local inhabitants to turn over all food supplies to the army and commit suicide before U.S. troops landed. The obedient islanders, all 329 together, killed each other at the Onna River with razors, hatchets, and sickles. U.S. forces occupied nearby Iejima and used some of the local people to take surrender appeals to Akamatsu's unit on Tokashikijima. Akamatsu's men killed the emissaries and many members of the island's self-defense unit for allegedly violating orders. On another Okinawan island, Zamami, unit commander Umezawa ordered the island's elderly and children to commit suicide in front of the memorial to local war dead from the Sino and Russo-Japanese Wars. The remaining islanders were forbidden to pick any potatoes or vegetables. Thirty persons who violated the order were starved or shot. On the main island of Okinawa, many civilians were killed as suspected spies. Local people who fled to the main defense trenches were ordered to retreat \"because of military necessity.\" The civilians were forced out of the trenches right into heavy American fire. As the fighting drew to an end, civilians hid with the military in caves at the southern tip of the island. When a frightened child cried out, a soldier grabbed it from the mother's arms and strangled the child to death in front of everyone. It was a grim warning against making any noise that would reveal their location to the U.S. forces.Source:*The Pacific War, 1931-1945 A Critical Perspective On Japan's Role in World War II* by Sabur\u014d Ienaga.

Longer answer: Southern generals feared that the assassination would have dire consequences for the South due to harsh reactions from the North.  \u201c[Many ranking Confederate officials] believed that they had lost a generous foe and that Northern opinion would be inflamed against the Southern people.\u201d  Fear was widespread among both the Southern generals and the elite during this time.  While many did not want to give up the fight for the Confederacy, they still feared Northern attachment to Lincoln.  Southern military leaders were concerned that Lincoln\u2019s death would serve as a lightening rod for Northern aggression toward the South.  This belief coincides with many others in the South, who feared what Northern Reconstruction for the South would entail.  Jefferson Davis, Edward Pollard, and Alexander Stephens all published books after the war glorifying Lincoln\u2019s personal character while also blaming him for the conflict.  They agreed that Lincoln had, \u201cNo personal ill-will towards the South, [and he] wished [for] a speedy and peaceful reconciliation.\u201d   Despite any strong words promoting Lincoln and condemning his assassination, many leaders still harbored resentment against him for the war.  Jefferson Davis later stated that, \u201cFor an enemy so relentless in the war for our subjugation, we could not be expected to mourn; yet, in view of its political consequences, it could not be regarded otherwise than as a great misfortune to the South.\u201d   Jefferson Davis\u2019s position was even more precarious after the assassination, as Edwin Stanton listed Davis as a member of a conspiracy group against Lincoln.  Confederate leaders had to condemn outright the assassination because Edwin Stanton implicated them early on as members of a larger conspiracy against the President and the Union.Within a matter of days, citizens of the South learned not only of the armistice after Appomattox, but of the assassination of their new leader, as well.   As Mary Darby DeTreville wrote, \u201cOne day we were stunned by the news of General Lee\u2019s surrender\u2026 The next day came the news of Lincoln\u2019s assassination.  Did ever any two days bring such unfortunate news for us?\u201d The initial reactions from Southern elites were that of disbelief.  Many thought the news reports were plots to deceive them.  In her memoir, Constance Cary Harrison states that, \u201cI think nobody in my neighborhood believed the rumor of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s assassination until it was confirmed by a Federal soldier\u2026.\u201d   Reliable news was hard to come by in the South after the destructiveness of total warfare brought on by the Union generals.  Constance Harrison continued by saying that, \u201cIt is difficult to comprehend\u2026 the state of uncertainty in which we lived at this time.

I consider myself well read on military aviation, but I never considered the scene in King Kong!  So, I had to do some research to get to the specifics.  There are two movies that I considered, the 1933 version and the 2005 version.  In the 1933 version, the planes used were reportedly Curtiss Falcons.  This two seat biplane was in service from the late 20's until the mid 1930's in all branches of the US military.  They were assuredly in front-line service in 1933 when the film made its debut.  The 2005 movie featured Curtiss SBC Helldivers, which were first delivered in 1937 but were still two seater biplanes.  Neither plane was designed for dogfighting.  The Falcon was an observation and light bombing aircraft, and the Helldiver was a bomber that was known to be vulnerable to enemy fighters and was kept well clear of the fighting in WWII.One thing to keep in mind is that the Army Air Corps (edit, not the USAAF, thanks /u/ZayneXZanders!) and the US Navy had relatively very few planes before the 1940's.  Iconic monoplanes of the early war like the F4F Wildcat, Brewster F2A Buffalo, Bell P-39 Airacobra, and Curtiss P-40 Warhawk were only delivered starting in 1940 (1939 for the Buffalo).  FDR only made his [\"Ominous Days\" speech in May of 1940](_URL_0_).  Martin Van Creveld argues that the 50,000 number targeted for aircraft production was taken \"out of thin air.\"  The US produced airplanes in the hundreds per year in the 1930's, only ramping up to the thousands per year in the latest years of that decade.  Creveld has the following numbers for the 1940's:  \"In 1940, a total of 12,804 machines left the assembly lines, 26,277 in 1941, 47,836 in 1942, 85,898 in 1943, 96,318 in 1944, and 49,761 in 1945...[n]othing like it has been seen since,and almost certainly nothing even remotely resembling it will ever be seen in any kind of future.\"  It was well known that biplanes were obsolete, even in the 1930's.  However, it took a deliberate decision to ramp up aircraft production.  This investment was only made when war was on the horizon and the Great Depression was starting to recede in importance.  The result was that obsolete planes stayed in active service far longer than they had any business doing so.  Biplanes even served in WWII, most famously the British used biplane Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers to cripple the *Bismarck* in 1941 (among other operations such as the attack on Taranto).  Planes that were known to be obsolete (the Brewster Buffalo and the F4F Wildcat in the Pacific theater come to mind, though they were 'modern' (edit, typo, meant to say MID, not LOW.  Thanks /u/eidetic!) mid-wing monoplanes) were pressed into service because they were all the US *had*.

If it's alright, I am going to post again a comment that I made a few months ago. I am going to edit it slightly, because I was drunk. It is also a WALL of text, so forgive me for that as well!The first thing to understand is that dead people have such amazing charge. People care about them. That seems obvious, but... but why is it obvious? The person is dead - their body has technically become an object. What's the difference between a dead body and any other object? It seems weird that we would throw a broken plate into the rubbish bin while treating something equally not alive as the focal point for myth and memory.Right now the reader is saying \"Crossy, you moron, they were a person! They have meaning and emotion attached to them. People loved them. People don't care about a broken plate.\" Yep; when something is a 'person' it is suddenly the focus for many, many identities - those identities get mapped by other people onto its (probably human) body. Like masculinity is mapped onto the penis, for instance, or femininity onto the womb.So when people die their bodies stay, and those identities linger; the body can therefore be used by other people as a kind of metaphor. A signifier, if you will, for what the dead person was. That's why the outrage is intense if that dead body is messed with; that's why its pretty vital even today to the grieving process for families have a body. An empty grave is just not satisfying to visit - it is empty - even though the person is dead inside the grave or out of it.And because a grave a site of dense richness, oh does modern war bugger grieving patterns. Those Great War cemeteries with their ranks of war dead interred near or in the battlefield where they died? Profoundly unnatural. All politics. The bodies were co-opted in death as they had been conscripted in life. Stolen for their \"charge\" and richness of meaning.I use the word 'stolen' in a very real sense, because in the normal course of death, bodies are returned to their families. Naturally some of the men like the Kiwis, Canadians, and Aussies were simply too far away to be returned; those countries accepted their burden, but still had hundreds and hundreds of letters and personal appeals for photos, information, witnesses. As for Britian; the Imperial War Graves Commission stole those bodies. A bloke named Ware decided that the mass of dead was a glorious opportunity. He argued up, down, and sideways until it was a matter of policy that no bodies would be returned from the Great War to any Commonwealth country - not even at private expense. The bodies in his vision were ordered, their emotional connection and understandings layered into cemetery-memorials to Empire. A place of pilgrimage for the entire Commonwealth that would strengthen all the bounds between the countries by reminding them of their common sacrifice. I wish I was making this up, because it depresses me, but I am not.It depresses me because this usurpation of bodies caused profound unhappiness - in Britishers especially, because the bodies were right there. Some of the rich folks nipped across and grabbed their sons without telling anyone, but even that was stopped pretty soon, and the poor never even got the opportunity too. I read a really heartbreaking letter from a mother which read \"you took my son away from me in life and now you take him away from me in death\".And the result of all of this? Grief. Unending grief. Mourning for the Great War keeps going - people couldn't tend their family member's grave, or visit it, or even know if there was one. Men were blown to pieces, or were buried in mud - completely missing. Had people ever had that before, on such a massive scale? Not just the disruption to mourning practices to not have a body or a grave, but not having a grave at all? And the grief was so total - back before the war folks in England would hang out black drapes, all their neighbors came around with food, and family would appear. During the Great War visible grief was frowned upon - after all, the casualties were so heavy, what made your boy so special? If you can't mourn like you need to, and your support network is broken, and you don't have a body, then your grief goes on and on.Those cemeteries which we all take for granted now, and which steal your breath - they are an abomination. They are the government saying \"these men were more important in their identity as soldiers of empire than they were in any identity they ever had as father or husband or son or nephew.\" Ware and his Imperial War Graves Commission imposed what HE believed those soldiers were onto their bodies. Not the identity that the soldier had believed. Not what the family believed. Only Ware could decide.Isn't that a bit sad?The best book on all of this is by a man named Bart Ziino, and it's called \"A Distant Grief\". It's a really readable book, except for the subject matter.Now, the Imperial War Graves Commission policy was a Big Change from before. Prior, bodies were often buried where foreign battles - but they could have been brought home had the family the inclination. Plus, the British troopers were regulars, who often had their wives and children with them on campaign. Grief practices could be done \"on site\", as it were. No way was the government going to get in the way of that, because *the government didn't claim to own the bodies*. In the First World War though, there was no way to get the bodies back. The War Graves Commission had plans for those bodies which didn't involve the families. It involved Empire building, places of pilgrimage, and general veneration of \"British values.\"Grief in New Zealand and Australia in the First World War had much more acceptance of the lack of bodies - distance modifies the rules of mourning. Pretty much the deaths in the First World War were treated (at the time! Later on it changed!) like the deaths New Zealanders and Aussies had prior, like in the Boer war. Except bigger. Much bigger. The scale of death was definitely a factor in why the Imperial War Graves Commission decision was so bad - it was a decision made in a new context where properly demonstrative grief wasn't being socially allowed in the various Commonwealth countries. The support system had been strained past the point where it could cope with all the loss. Does that make sense? And the lack of bodies - bodies which were essentially just a hop, skip, and a jump away - only made these things worse because traditional middle-class things like tending the graves etc simply couldn't be done. It was just appalling. We're still dealing with the grief from it, and its nearly a century later.The French, now they tried to do the same thing - they made large military cemeteries as well. But Frenchmen weren't putting up with that bullshit when they lived nearby the cemeteries, and simply paid people to pinch the bodies of their sons in order to bring them home again. After awhile, the \"theft\" problem became so endemic that the French government allowed bodies to be returned to their families if those families desired: about a third took the government up on this offer.

It caused a LOT of social problems.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The decision to not bring back the bodies of England\u2019s war dead back at the end of WW1 was met with outrage by many people.

Also, since the government had indeed killed or imprisoned many people for political reasons it wasn't unreasonable to suspect the government in an important person's death. Trotsky, one of the founding members of the Soviet Union, was assassinated by Stalin, not to mention many of Stalin's generals and other officials. In this context, suspicion was entirely rational.I can think of two important people whose death was widely suspected to be caused by the government when most signs point to them being accidental. The first is Yuri Gagarin, first man in space, who was killed in a fighter training accident some years later. There is a popular theory that he was purposefully killed by the government.Another is Vladimir Visotsky, an actor and musician who by all accounts had serious drug and alcohol problems. However he had snubbed the authorities in numerous ways, writing subversive songs, traveling without official permission and so on, and so it was entirely expected that the government might try to do away with him.While this is not strictly a soviet period conspiracy I recommend reading about the Moscow apartment bombings to get a feel for the level of suspicion and uncertainty surrounding any story told by the Russian government. In short there is a varying level of belief regarding whether all Chechen terrorist acts in the '90s-'00s were a government conspiracy. This includes the 1999 bombings that provided the excuse for the second Chechnya war, the Moscow Theater hostage crisis where the government used poison gas to subdue the attackers and killed many of the hostages, and the Beslan school attack where again actions by the authorities resulted in the deaths of many hostages.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Soviet Union had a number of popular conspiracy theories, including the \"Kremlin Conspiracy\" and the \"Kremlin Conspiracy II\".

At the end of WWI, the leaders of the Japanese Empire was stunned by the defeat of the Prussian forces and the Central Powers in general.  Analyzing things they reached the conclusion that one of the critical, and new, factors was the fact that WWI was a **WORLD** war and that unlike in prior wars where the various neutral powers had made loans and sold supplies to various sides, in WWI the Central Powers had been choked off from the necessary war making supplies due to the fact that most other powers had either picked a side or had remained neutral in a new way that included not making loans or selling supplies.There was, therefore, a large faction in the Japanese leadership strongly advocating for autarky, the expansion of Japan's sphere of influence and control until it directly commanded all of the necessary war making materials and was not dependent on foreign trade to import the necessary goods to continue a war.  Petroleum was high on that list, but making war then also needed rubber, tungsten, manganese, and a wide variety of somewhat scarce materials that simply did not exist in any quantity in the Japanese islands. [1]Japan was also looking at the world through the lens of colonialism, and saw their natural sphere of influence as being East Asia and the Asian Pacific.  The European colonial powers were viewed as interlopers who needed to be evicted so that Japan could take their place.  Their reasoning was that Europe should colonize Africa, and America colonize South America, and leave East Asia for Japan to colonize. Japan already had most of Korea and large sections of North East China.  Their goal was not so much to actually own outright the South Pacific and the rest of China, but to take over the colonial quasi-ownership that the European powers had put in place there.  Korea and Manchuko were planned to be directly colonized by ethnic Japanese moving in and remaking the native cultures into something more Japanese, not so much the rest of the Empire.As for the US, Japan's plan was influenced both by cultural attitudes and their own history.For this we need to go back to the Russo/Japanese war.  Russia had taken Port Arthur (now  L\u00fcshun City), then as now an essential railhead and deep water port.  Japan easily defeated the small Russian naval force and besieged the city in what was really a precursor to WWI complete with godawful static trench warfare, massive casualties for minuscule gains, and all the other things that made WWI so horrible.The Russian Empire decided to send the Baltic Fleet to break the siege, a decision complicated by the fact that the Russian Empire was then fighting the British Empire and couldn't take the Suez Canal.  It took nearly a year for the Baltic Fleet to get all the way to Japan, and the plan was to run the strait of Tsushima up to Vladivostok and get in some maintenance, repair, resupply, and R & R for the sailors before heading back out to  engage the Japanese near Port Arthur.Instead the Japanese Navy (mostly by incredible good luck) caught the Russian navy in the strait of Tsushima and defeated them in the single most one sided naval victory that has ever taken place.  Japan lot three torpedo boats while sinking six Russian battleships and fourteen other ships, capturing Russian seven ships, and seeing a tiny handful flee, broken, to Vladivostok.Shortly afterward, deciding basically that Port Arthur wasn't worth the trouble, the Tsar made peace on favorable terms with the Japanese.***********************That was what Japan was looking to duplicate with America.They didn't want to, or plan to, fight an extended war with the USA.  Japan's leadership knew that America's main interests and sympathies were in Europe, they knew that FDR was desperate to get into the war on the UK's side and fight against Hitler, so they hoped that a show of strength, a quick decisive battle that devastated the US navy as they had devastated the Russian Baltic Fleet, would convince America to do as the Russians had done and basically pull out of East Asia and leave Japan to solidify and expand its colonial possessions there, thus achieving autarky and finally being safe from foreign attack.With the US out of the picture and the other European powers fighting among themselves, Japan intended to evict the Dutch, French, Germans, and so on from their various East Asian colonial possessions, take over the administration of those possessions, and thus gain the materials produced there.  [1] Rubber was not only necessary for tubing and tires, but also consumed in various industrial processes (today we use synthetic products and not so much natural rubber for the same processes), over 100 pounds of rubber were simply used up in making the parts needed for a tank, for example.Manganese is critical for producing steel in any quantity.  It only takes a kilo or so per tonne, but without that kilo of manganese you get a spongy mess of useless crap, not useful steel.Tungsten is necessary for hardening steel to make metal cutting tools, armor, armor piercing shells, and more.All those materials came from either China, or the South Pacific.  There are no useful sources of any in either Japan, Europe, or the USA.  There's also sources in South America and Africa, but they weren't very developed when WWII started, and one of the big projects that doesn't get a lot of attention was the US development of those sources during WWII so they could keep the factories going.EDIT: Sources*Japan Prepares for Total War*, Michael Barnhart*War and National Reinvention - Japan in the Great War*, Frederick Dickinson*Japanese Imperialism*, W.G.

It was Blake who said that Milton was \"of the Devil's party without knowing it\", at the time a radical reinterpretation, but with emphasis on \"without knowing\". Milton was a devout Christian and though the text is can be seen as subversive from a post-romantic, rugged individualism perspective, the original religious intent is made clear from the beginning, \"to justify the ways of god to man\". However, as recently as 1941, CS Lewis wrote that the poem does not seek to glorify Satan: > In the same way, the proposition that Milton's Satan is a magnificent character may bear two senses. It may mean that Milton's presentation of him is a magnificent poetical achievement which engages the attention and excites the admiration of the reader. On the other hand, it may mean that the real being (if any) whom Milton is depicting, or any real being like Satan if there were one, or a real human being in so far as he resembles Milton's Satan, is or ought to be an object of admiration and sympathy, conscious or unconscious, on the part of the poet his readers or both. The first, so far as I know, has never till modern times been denied; the second, never affirmed before the times of Blake and Shelley-for when Dryden said that Satan was Milton's 'hero' he meant something quite different. It is, in my opinion, wholly erroneous. In saying this I have, however, trespassed beyond the bounds of purely literary criticism. In what follows, therefore, I shall not labour directly to convert those who admire Satan, but only to make a little clearer what it is they are admiring. That Milton could not have shared their admiration will then, I hope, need no argument. The main difficulty is that any real exposition of the Satanic character and the Satanic predicament is likely to provoke the question 'Do you, then, regard Paradise Lost as a comic poem?' To this I answer, No; but only those will fully understand it who see that it might have been a comic poem. In terms of whether this intention resonated with contemporaries, Maltzahn reports that \"the conservative Hobart welcomes Milton's christian epic as a counterweight to the irreligious court culture of the day\". He goes on to discuss the contemporary need to separate Milton's incendiary political views from his orthodox religious ones. Paradise Lost was controversial when seen as a political allegory, depending on which side of the English civil war you were on. As CS Lewis mentions, Dryden handled this topic as well, and as a royalist he rewrote the poem figuring Satan as Oliver Cromwell, which was certainly meant to be an insult not a compliment.In terms of Milton's sensitive publications, his Aeropagitica is a polemic arguing for free speech. This and his discussion of divorce were the publications which attracted the most controversy although they were never censored. Remember that this is well after the reformation, and though it might be a generalisation, power lay with either the King or parliament, not with the church. If something was politically expedient it was allowed, see Christopher Marlowe's extremely blasphemous productions of Doctor Faustus while allegedly in the secret service of Elizabeth I.Sources: Alicia Ostriker, Dancing at the Devil's Party: Some Notes on Politics and Poetry Critical Inquiry Vol. 13, No. 3, Politics and Poetic Value (Spring, 1987), pp. 579-596C.

Lahun was founded as a pyramid town of Senusret II and flourished during the Middle Kingdom; a town plan can be seen [here](_URL_26_). Domestic space at Lahun consists of the \"mayor's house\" on the acropolis, five northern mansions, three southern mansions, eastern housing, and western housing. The latter two were fairly simple compared to the mansions; comparative floor plans [can be seen here](_URL_16_). A mansion at Lahun consisted of a reception hall, sleeping quarters, an office, servants' quarters, and workshops and food preparation areas. Egyptian tomb models depict many of the parts of the house of an elite Egyptian family, including the [granary](_URL_20_), [butchery](_URL_18_), [livestock pens](_URL_0_), [weaving workshop](_URL_6_), [baking and brewing facilities](_URL_21_), and [carpentry workshop](_URL_25_). A [garden and pool](_URL_24_) formed the center of the house. Finally, the exterior of the house contained porticoes used for public appearances and [cattle counts](_URL_22_). Wealthy Egyptians had many different ways to entertain themselves. [Banquets](_URL_7_) were quite popular, and [musicians and dancers](_URL_1_) as well as [harpists and storytellers](_URL_11_) were hired to entertain guests. To relax and escape the heat, wealthy Egyptians often took boat excursions into the marshes for [fishing and fowling](_URL_10_). These [boating excursions](_URL_14_) often involved numerous people. Ancient Egypt had several grades of linen, including \"royal linen\" (*s\u0161r nsw*) and \"fine linen\" (*\u0161mat nfrt*). Elite clothing was therefore distinguished from the clothing of commoners by quality as much as complexity. For a comparison of the clothing worn by commoners and the clothing of the Egyptian elite, see this [New Kingdom tomb painting](_URL_5_); note the quality of the sheer linen worn by Nakht, the tomb owner. Egyptian male nobles sometimes received the [gold of honor](_URL_13_) from the king as a sign of favor, and elite Egyptian women wore elaborate [jewelry](_URL_23_) and [wigs](_URL_15_) as a mark of their status.

The [Heqanakht papyri](_URL_12_) provide a rare glimpse of literacy within a middle class family during the Middle Kingdom. The papyri, written in a lovely hieratic hand, are the remnants of a correspondence between a priest and his family. Heqanakht seems to have been a rather irritable fellow, and his letters are full of indignation and criticisms on how the household is being run in his absence. One of his sons, for example, seems to have been harassing his father's new wife. > As this man lives for me - it's Ip l'm referring to - whoever shall make any sexual advance against my new wife, he is against me and I against him.

If I had to sum things up, I would say \"religion and prophecy,\" but that also is not very interesting in and of itself.**Joan as Holy Woman**From Joan's own testimony at her trial, it is easily apparent that she was deeply immersed in the religious culture of her time. The saints most important to her are the most popular ones, she's right with the new trend in angels, she's sold on the rising importance of devotion to the Holy Name of Jesus.This is important because Joan fits firmly in the context of the early 15th century as a holy woman and prophet. Her visions and auditions anchor her in a tradition going back to the mid-12th century of women who used the message that they spoke and acted based on direct revelation from God. In Joan's time, *some* people are starting to question the validity of holy women's claims. The initial questions themselves, though in some ways the culmination of a longer trend, are highly political as a result of the Avignon papacy and (especially) the Great Schism (ca1378-1415). In other words, they are very much tied to ecclesiastical politics.On the ground level, what we find is much more ongoing confidence in women's revelations. 14th century saints and visionaries Catherine of Siena and especially Birgitta of Sweden are *all the rage*. People even start attributing to Birgitta texts that she didn't write; she's that famous and popular even among the literate classes. Birgitta (and Pseudo-Birgitta) becomes especially well-known for two things that transcend the literacy barrier: prophecy and a set of prayers.Not everyone, but a whole lot of people, took Joan absolutely seriously as conveying divine messages directly. In very particular, Charles VII was raised in an environment where his parents firmly believed in the prophetic powers of holy women. Charles VI had given audience to Jeanne-Marie de Maill\u00e9; and Isabeau, to Marie Robine (a peasant, by the way). And this was, of course, the key issue at her initial and nullification (rehabilitation) trials: were Joan's fake or real; demonic or divine...according to the political beliefs of the judge or witness. For a demonstration, turn to no less a contemporary authority than French \"theologian  & c\" Jean Gerson (uh...he was Really Important; roll with it), who is infamously on the record as opposing the legitimacy of holy women...but wrote dramatically in support of Joan.**Joan and Wonders**Kelly DeVries, who is basically *the* authority on Joan as a soldier and commander, stresses the importance of religion in the accounts of Joan's contemporary supporters as well as her own (*Joan of Arc: A Military Leader*, but especially \"A Woman as a Leader of Men\" in *Fresh Verdicts on Joan of Arc*, which is, well, about this question's precise topic). He's right, although his account is based on Joan's full career, including her victories. Which, again, is a liiiittle bit of a cop-out.I want to go back to the 15th century mindset again, to look at the overall supernatural cosmology of the era. Well into the early modern era, there's no real divide between what we would call \"religion\" and \"magic.\" (Indeed, \"religion\" doesn't even have our meaning until the 15th century.) As with belief in revelations from God, people live in a world of wonders and miracles and saints and supernatural creatures. But as seen with growing concern with witchcraft and questions about holy women's sincerity, the boundaries are just starting to be sketched out by some people.This is especially apparent in Joan's case. The wonders associated with her don't really have a division in what she relates about other people's support of her. They *do* have a divide in the mindset of her interrogators--and, because Joan is frakking *awesome*, she knows exactly what they're doing and keeps pace. (Seriously, read Dan Hobbins' translation *The Trial of Joan of Arc*. She's great.)A big one is Joan's knowledge of and then the discovery of \"her sword\" in a church dedicated to one of France's most important saints. The finding of a blessed object has major precursors in the Middle Ages, especially associated with the Crusades. In the 15th century, that was more important than ever. The *physical reality* of objects was critical to how people saw the world and religion in a way it wasn't earlier. Second, the cult of relics and saints was, you guessed it, critical in a way it hadn't been earlier. (Think of Mark Twain's remark about there being more shards of the Holy Cross in the world--in the 19th century still!--than there could have been in the actual cross.)According to Joan herself, people also told stories about a prophecy they associated with her and a tree/forest near her home in Domremy. But in her own words, what people said to her about this was just linked to her performing wonders. This probably included a miraculous power to heal, which was also heavily tied to holy women/living saints in late Middle Ages. (There are stories about men, women, and children all trying to touch Joan, which seems suspiciously, I don't know, *biblical*. And yes, at a time when there was much more preaching of the Bible directly.) The tree was associated with fairies and local children performed May Crowning-type playing/ritual activities around it, although Joan insists she never believed any of it and never engaged in a lot of the behaviors her judges asked her about. Of course, they lie WILDLY when they write up the articles of condemnation. On one hand, they say Joan admitted to various things when she categorically had not. On the other, though, they exaggerate the various behaviors and beliefs they had asked her about earlier. And, unsurprisingly, they exaggerate according to particular patterns that align with the question of fake or real, demonic or divine.So people associated Joan with the general performance of miracles and wonders.**Hans B\u00f6hm**Okay, obviously a man, obviously German, and not obviously a few decades after Joan. However, B\u00f6hm is a crucial parallel for a few reasons.

W. and de Jersey's Armorica and Britain: Cross-Channel Relationships in the Late First Millennium BC, it is stated that trade between Britons and European Gauls/Romans took place from the 2nd Century BC onwards. Their primary point of access was from what is now Hengistbury Head, Dorset; Cunliffe makes it clear in his 'Guide to Roman Britain' that this was the major trading centre between Europe and Britain. This is clear from the fact that more amphoras of Italian wine have been found here than in any other British site. The fact that most of these vessels date to before 50 B.C. is explained by how Caesar's invasion was actually bad for business in two ways. Firstly, as Britain and Gaul were major trading partners, Caesar's occupation of Gaul decreased trade. Secondly, after Caesar occupied Brittany and later the British Isles, trade was further diminished. As for how aware they were about Europe as a continent, they certainly had knowledge of many different factions. According to Sills in 'Gaulish and Early British Coinage', trade agreements were negotiated by North French tribes in which they patronised British businesses in exchange for British aid in the war against the Romans. Britons also made extensive contact with the Belgic tribes of Northern France, as large numbers of Gallo-Belgic gold coins dating from circa 200 BC to 50 BC were all excavated in Southwest England (Cunliffe). These facts show that Britons did not only trade with Europeans in commodities, but also in diplomacy and currency. But how much did they know about **life** (society/culture) outside the Isles? According to Cunliffe - I feel uncomfortable quoting so widely from him, but he really is the ultimate authority on late Iron Age Britain - burial customs in south-east England even changed to better resemble Belgic rituals. Julius Caesar in his Gallic War goes one step further, asserting that the Belgics were a part of the Britons, because they made raids on the Isles and settled there. There are also instances of rich men who were buried in their graves with Roman luxury objects, indicating that Roman culture and aesthetic standards had permeated British society. This is supported by DW Harding in 'The Iron Age in Lowland Britain', in which he lists many archaeological discoveries that suggest prolonged (from before 100 BC) interactions and trade between the Isles and the Continent. For example, gold tarcs in the Belgic style have been dug up in what is now known as Sussex. The Britons also fought with some European 'invaders' before the Romans. The Catuvellauni were the 'native Britons'; the Dobunni and even the Iceni were considered mainland (mostly Belgic) invaders. According to Allen, prior to Roman occupation, there was an extensive tribal clash between these factions which ended anywhere around 100 - 80 BC. Nevertheless, not much is known about how everyday Britons *felt* about Belgics/Romans on a personal level, because of the lack of British writers whose works have survived.In conclusion, it's clear that Britons had an **extremely complex relationship** with different sorts of Europeans, and that their interactions included trade, rivalry, and diplomacy. Hence, yes, it would be fair to say that they did know 'where the Romans were coming from', and that they knew much about their continental neighbours. There is however no evidence to suggest that the Britons ever led an exploratory mission to Europe, so they may have relied on word-of-mouth knowledge transmitted by traders.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Romans were the first Europeans to arrive in Britain, and the first to leave.

They are restricted solely for kings: under penalty of death no one is allowed to kill them. In ancient times, the animal had its habitats in the Germanic forests, nowadays (as far as I know) nowhere in Europe occurs, can be found only on this small patch of land, which is a remnant of the ancient HercyniaEarlier (1565) papal legate to Poland Fulvius Ruggierii have written that aurochs \"are to be found only in the Mazovian forests nearRawa, there are not many of them in Prussia\". Venetian envoy Hieronymus Lippomano (1575) also noted that \"They say that aurochs can be found only in the forests of Mazovia, where they are guarded and keep for the king's hunts\".Aurochs were restricted only for monarchs, we know about the laws from XIII century issued by Mazovian dukes that prohibit hunting on aurochs, and reserve them only for dukes. Polish kings and Lithuanian grand dukes were doing the same in their possesions and in Mazovia when it was included into Poland in late 15th century. Peasants living in surrounding villages were obliged to take care of the forest and especially of the aurochs. Their responsibility was provide them enough food, some of them called *\u0142owczy* were responsible of fighting off poachers. They were free from any other obligations, tributes or servitudes. At first it was just to keep royal herds intact for hunting but since 16th century it was mainly to keep the species alive (similiary protected was \u017cubr - european bison). There was also other factor, *tur*/aurochs was regarded as national symbol and pride of the kingdom. When king Sigismund III was granting to Stanis\u0142aw Radziejowski the position of starosta of Sochaczew he reminded him to: >  Do his best in breeding of aurochs, not sparing any efforts and keeping guards in the fields, because they belong ad famam Regni, it is to the fame of the KingdomAurochs or their horns were often granted as gifts to distinguished guests or foreign monarchs, like emperor or pope. They often were also invited on hunting. Since the half of 16th century aurochs were counted so we know exactly how many of them were still alive. It looks like royal warnings were not enough because during first years of Radziejowski rule almost all animals died out (from 24 in 1599 to just 4 in 1602). Radziejowski was tried by royal judges, but eventually he remained on his position.

Long story short, former confederates, after the war, tried to white-wash their image, saying that they had not, in fact, seceded from the union to protect the institution of slavery. Now as I mentioned, there is absolutely no debate about this having been the case. They said it at the time, before secession and during the war, but after having lost the war, and seen emancipation, that reasoning was no longer politically sound, so they invented the Lost Cause myth. That's the major part of the politics. The identity part comes in because folks, primarily the descendants of former Confederates, have issues with taking pride in their ancestors and so tend to cling to the false notion that the war was not about slavery. After all, how can you take pride in your ancestors if they fought to uphold something that is pretty universally considered to be wrong? For whatever reason, there is a disconnect that occurs among some folks, wherein they cannot separate being proud of the martial spirit of their ancestors who believed for what they fought and being proud of *the reason itself*. Because of this disconnect, folks tend to argue that the reason for the war itself was something different (states rights, economic issues, what have you) than what it was primarily about - the maintenance of the institution of slavery.

In a previous answer, [I discussed the emergence of the term 'heavy metal'](_URL_8_), which dates to 1970 or so in a musical context. However, 'heavy metal' wasn't really used as a *genre* term at the time; it was more a sonic descriptor, in the way that 'angular' is a sonic descriptor (over)used by rock critics. Bands from the early 1970s like Black Sabbath - which we now might called 'proto-metal' or maybe even just 'heavy metal' these days - were largely called things like 'downer rock' at the time. Or 'hard rock'. Or just 'rock'. In contrast, it's perhaps with the rise of the British New Wave Of Heavy Metal movement - most famously associated with bands like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden in the mid-to-late 1970s - that you start to see 'heavy metal' consistently used not just by critics to describe sound but to refer to a genuine genre with its own aesthetic and fans.As to the 'downer rock' of the early 1970s, a [1971 Lester Bangs review of Black Sabbath's *Master Of Reality* in *Rolling Stone*](_URL_0_) gives a flavour of how it was taken at the time. Bangs compares and contrasts Black Sabbath with Grand Funk Railroad, another loud band of the era who were an American band who--well, for more information about Grand Funk Railroad, [consult your school library](_URL_2_)--but suffice to say that they were a loud band who had fewer traces of the blues than Cream and Hendrix, but who weren't quite downers like Sabbath. For Bangs: >  Grand Funk's vision is one of universal brotherhood (as when they have spoken of taking their millions to the White House with a list of demands), but Black Sabbath's, until *Master of Reality* anyway, has concentrated relentlessly on the self-immolating underside of all the beatific Let's Get Together platitudes of the counter culture.In the review Bangs, despite having a claim to inventing the term 'heavy metal', doesn't use the term; instead he mostly just calls both bands 'rock'. These days, Grand Funk are rarely considered 'proto-metal' - they're more just 'hard rock'. But Black Sabbath - who like Grand Funk were generally seen as 'hard rock' in the Ozzy Osbourne era in the early-to-mid 1970s - are usually seen as 'metal' in some way by modern audiences. When Bangs says that they're \"concentrating relentlessly on the self-immolating underside of all the beatific Let's Get Together platitudes of the counter culture\", he's indeed saying that Black Sabbath was a conscious reaction against the hippie movement. The relentlessness of Black Sabbath that Bangs identifies has a lot to do with the reasons that we associate them with metal today, where we see today Grand Funk as hard rock, but not quite metal.The 1970s was a point when hippie culture was well and truly mainstreamed, with successful hippie groups like Crosby Stills Nash and Young doing arena tours ([here playing 'Almost Cut My Hair' in their 1974 arena tour - I think the video was probably recorded at Wembley Stadium](_URL_4_)). And you did have critics like Lester Bangs loudly pooh-poohing hippie stuff as tired and out-of-date, and instead advocating music that Bangs argued reflected the death of the hippie dream. For Bangs in 1971, neither 'punk' or 'metal' yet existed, but what did exist was rock music that was nihilistic, not particularly melodic, and meant to be loud. Thus Bangs makes mentions of the MC5 and The Stooges - who are these days seen as 'proto-punk' - in relation to a Black Sabbath review - who we'd see more as metal. In 1971, in other words, there was no 'punk' and no 'metal' yet; there was just loud rock'n'roll music that was more relentless and nihilistic than usual.There's a 1974 article by Jon Tiven in *Circus Pages* titled 'Black Sabbath and Deep Purple: Who Really Are The Kings Of Heavy Metal?', which compares Black Sabbath and Deep Purple at length (and more offhandedly, Led Zeppelin), and which suggests that Blue Oyster Cult and Kiss might be upcoming American competition for their crowns. Tiven is definitely using the term in a way that comports with our modern understanding, but there's still some fluidity of usage, and it's not quite understood as a distinct genre yet: > Recently Sabbath was voted Best of the Punk Rock Bands in a British publication. \"Does that mean they think we're rubbish?\" queried a slightly paranoid Iommi.1974, mind you, is before the Ramones or the Sex Pistols - where Black Sabbath are called a 'punk rock band', it's because the way the likes of Lester Bangs conceptualised loud, heavy rock music was influential at this point. For Bangs and his ilk, 'punk' in 1974 meant a certain nihilism and willingness to dare to be a bit stupid and loud (in an era of twiddly, overtly-classically influenced progressive rock music). Metal takes itself quite seriously sometimes, and so people sometimes see Bangs' descriptions of the music as insulting, but he was pushing this stuff in the music as being a good thing compared to the [inexplicably popular, pretentious Rick Wakeman concept albums](_URL_7_) of the era.As to the New Wave Of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM) of the late 1970s - a term associated with Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, and so forth - it's about the point where, in English, you start to see heavy metal as a distinct genre. NWOBHM is not really anti-hippie, per se; by the late 1970s, hippie culture had receded somewhat in the UK. Instead, the popular things to react against in the UK, musically, were instead the seeming omnipresence of disco ([which I discuss here albeit in a more American context](_URL_6_)), the relative blandness of a lot of the pop of the era as would have been seen on *Top of the Pops*, and the headscratching pretentiousness of the (late period) progressive rock of the era. Usually, in music history discourse, this is all the stuff that *punk* was seen as reacting to - there was something of a feeling that the music on *Top Of The Pops* didn't reflect the times, politically or culturally, where it *had* reflected the times in 1966. And because the late 1970s in the UK was a period of social disharmony in a variety of ways, it's not entirely surprising that music that made a virtue of sounding unpretty - punk, for example - was the music that people thought mostly reflected the times. And, in the mid-to-late 1970s, all the same factors that apply to punk also apply to metal. With the addition that, in a way, NWOBHM was also responding to the cultural capital of punk amongst the music cognoscenti, and the way that punk dominated headlines and discussions of music in the cool London press. There was an art-school background to punk that was very deliberately absent in NWOBHM - which instead took visual reference in its cover art from pulp science fiction and fantasy book covers and the like. In the punk world, the bigger stars of punk quickly graduated from making loud guitar-heavy rackets to making more atonal, spiky rackets - for instance, Johnny Rotten going from ['Anarchy In The UK'](_URL_1_) to changing his name back to John Lydon and [doing stuff like 'Death Disco'](_URL_3_) by 1978/1979. In contrast to the art-school backgrounds of a lot of punk bands, the stereotype of the NWOBHM band is that they came from bleak, no-nonsense industrial towns like Birmingham and that their music reflects that ([though Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden went to a posh boarding school](_URL_9_) and Johnny Rotten himself was very working-class in background - it's not a simple class divide). But there was certainly a perception that metal was much more popular in much of regional Britain.Of course, [the emergence of heavy metal as a mainstream-ish genre in the USA is a different story - I explain the rise of hair metal in the 1980s here](_URL_5_), and globally is a different story altogether I suspect (but that's a story someone else will have to tell you!)(Edit: I originally wrote this living after midnight, which is clearly the most metal time of the day, but not necessarily conductive to clear thought!

He used a pill called \"Laudanum\" which he claimed could cure almost anything.  > \"I possess a secret remedy which I call laudanum and which is superior to all other heroic remedies.\"His recipe seems to have been at least: opium, henbane, crushed pearls and coral, amber, musk, several essential oils, and a bit of dried cow's intestine. Later, laudanum came to mean opium dissolved in alcohol, sometimes wine, sometimes distilled spirits and was a popular \"medicinal\" preparation in Europe during the 1700s - 1800s.Another gem from Paracelsus:   > \"All substances are poisons; there is none that is not a poison. The right dose differentiates a poison and a remedy.\"The Ancient Egyptians/Sumerians, Romans/Greeks, as well as the Germanic and Steppe tribes they all came in contact with all certainly knew of and used opium to some degree or another. To go a bit further back than that, lets talk about the Eleusian Mysteries of ancient Greece. This religious cult was arguably older than Greek culture itself and seems to have risen from proto-Anatolian fertility rituals on the coasts of the Aegean. In an infrequent (annual?, once-in-a-lifetime? -- don't really know) ritual offered to individuals in certain strata of Greek society, the group possibly used psychedelic plants or fungi in the production of a religious drink used by followers. These drinks may have contained ergot alkaloids from fungi on grain. Persephone, goddess whose mother, Demeter, is associated with grain, her return from the Underworld is connected with the symbolic rebirth experience of the Eleusian Mysteries. Ergot fungi contains various psychoactive alkaloids, such as lysergic acid amide, lysergic acid hydroxyethylamide, as well as other alkaloids all of which are very much psychedelics. In fact, the use of the drink was apparently so popular and sought-after that a well-known citizen of Athens was arrested for stealing the drink from an Eleussian Temple and drinking it with his friends in his apartment. In Medieval Italy, there are many reports of people purposefully infecting their grains with Ergot fungi and then mixing the results with an alcoholic beverage. This experience would have been close to what LSD feels like. And Psilocybin-based mushrooms were also being used and trafficked throughout the region and we even have a Venetian ship manifesto from the 1300s that records shrooms being brought from Crimea. Cannabis was also well-known throughout most of the near east and Central Asia and was used throughout Europe as well. Ancient Greek k\u00e1nnabis was the transcription of a  a Scythian term. In the earliest (ca. 440 BCE) reference to recreational cannabis usage, Herodotus recorded cannabis steam baths in The Histories: > \"The Scythians, as I said, take some of this hemp-seed [presumably, flowers], and, creeping under the felt coverings, throw it upon the red-hot stones; immediately it smokes, and gives out such a vapour as no Grecian vapour-bath can exceed; the Scyths, delighted, shout for joy.\"---To get more relevant for your question, Saint Hildegard of Bingen (1098 \u2013 17 September 1179) wrote a treatise on natural medicine titled Causae et Curae. In this book, she advocates the use of various compounds that we would consider to be dangerous and illegal pyschoactive compounds. She also talks about the abuse of these compounds by some people and how to help them overcome addiction. But her ultimate conclusion is that all things were put on Earth for man to use and ingest so it's all fair game. She was particularly popular amongst monks seeking spiritual enlightenment. On other side of things, Malleus Malleficarum , a medieval book on witches and evil sorcerors, talks about how certain drugs and users of certain drugs could indicate witchcraft. This shows us that people were certainly taking these substances. Byzantine Empire was much more intense than any of these guys. There are countless hagiographies to study and lets just say that when a saint had an ecstatic religious moment, he most likely had a little help. ---It should be mentioned that most people made teas/pastes/foods from various plants in their surrounding regions that contained various psychoactive compounds. I assumed that you wanted to ask about Medieval Europe, it is very different in the Middle East, Africa, South/North America, and Asia during the same time period and I can expand on those regions if you need me to. ------Sources:Sources and Problems in the History of Drug Commerce in Late Medieval Europe, Bruce P.

As for the SS it's important that in only very few cases was the SS just packing up and leaving the inmates to be liberated (this happened in Buchenwald and Mauthausen) and with most camps these were ordered evacuations that resulted in death marches for the inmates.By all descriptions, the Reich's leadership reacted in a variety of ways to the situation at the end of 1944 and beginning of 1945. As per Ian Kershaw's description in his book *The End* >  Survival strategies varied, though they usually involved some refusal to accept reality.G\u00f6ring was among the more realistic in that he certainly recognized that the Luftwaffe was beat and had no chance at opposing the RAF and Air Force onslaught on German cities. While he retreated to his luxury palace to the north of Berlin, Ribbentrop insisted to the Japanese ambassador in January that everything wax going fine and the Germans now held the initiative on all fronts. Robert Ley spent most of his time in a drunk stupor but when he was sober remained adamant about an apocalyptic showdown with the Allies even should there be a social revolution. Bormann and his wife spent their time planning on how to rebuilt Germany after the war was over, including plans for extensive air raid shelters in every house build by Jewish forced laborers. Himmler who was at the time in his headquarters in the Black Forest held on to the illusion that he would succeed in splitting the Allies and marching eastward with British troops at his back. Goebbels, fiercely loyal to Hitler, was cautiously optimistic about the Ardennes despite their failure. Speer, the old opportunist, later claimed that this was the time when he truly realized that the war was lost. The OKW had a clear picture of the dire situation and saw that the defenses were overstretched and resources were at an end. However, they too remained convinced that fighting until the bitter end was necessaryHitler at the same time was able to muster his tried and tested act of supreme confidence and optimism in the face of bleak reality by giving one of the most over the top new year's speeches that promised the ultimate victory, a crack in the anti-Nazi alliance and ultimate victory. Again, as per Kershaw: >  His own hold on reality was waning, but had far from vanished. Beneath the veneer of indomitability that his role of F\u00fchrer demanded, he was eminently capable of realizing the consequences of the unfolding disaster. His Luftwaffe adjutant, Nicolaus von Below, found him one evening after the failure of the Ardennes offensive, depressed and admitting that the war was lost \u2013 characteristically attributing it to the betrayal and the failings of others. For him now the struggle was about his place in history \u2013 a heroic end, not a cowardly capitulation for the country as in 1918. \"We'll not capitulate\", Below recalled him saying. \"Never. We can go down. But we'll take the world with us.\"And as for the population of Berlin: The diaries we have describing how New Year's Eve went are mostly concerned with the destruction of the city and the bombing on December 31. Plus the Berliners didn't exactly have a lot of venues to celebrate. What hadn't been bombed, had been closed. Theaters and Varietes had been closed since the autumn of 1944 and bars and other places had pretty much run out of stuff to sell provided they were still standing. Alcohol was still available but only through the black market and all in all things looked pretty bleak.Journalist Ursula von Kardorff wrote in her diary: \"The usual bombing [British bombers had flown a night raid on Berlin on December 31] which serves as our new year's firecrackers and leaves only broken windows. [...] At midnight, a moment of silence. We were standing with our glasses and didn't dare toast, for from afar we heard air raid sirens and shots.\"Both Alexander Platz and Ged\u00e4chtniskirche are destroyed, all over Berlin only smoking craters. One million people in the city are without a home and in the aftermath of the bombings, gangs of young people plunder homes and shops of what is left. The trams are still running but almost every line ends in a crater somewhere along their drive. The inhabitants of Berlin go on to give new names to parts of the city. Lichterfelde in the south becomes \"Trichterfelde\" (crater field), Steglitz becomes \"Stehtnix\" (nothing is standing), Charlottenburg \"Klamottenburg\".Walter Militz, who was working at the Siemens plant in Berlin wrote about the New Year: \"Everyone was curious about the situation in the air. The Nazis in the plant become more and more silent. Everyone hopes that it will be over soon. We just wanted to get out with our skins intact, but how?\" Militz also describes how Siemens tried to instill some celebratory mood in their workers by handing out the so-called \"Fliegerstulle\" (loosely translated \"Air Raid Sandwich\") to its workers, meaning in the beginning of January, workers at the plant would received an extra ration sandwich with 30g of margarine and a slice of meat. Ludwig Steeg, the Nazi mayor of Berlin, decreed that in celebration of the new year, the population of Berlin would in the time from January 2nd to January 7th receive an extra ration of cigarettes. Meanwhile elementary school teacher Arthur H. remains convinced of German victory: \"New Year's Eve. We are waiting for the big speech of the F\u00fchrer. After we had heard him speak we went to bed with the burning desire that all our wishes would come true in the New Year. The past year was a hard one for our people. But the New Year has given us new hope and courage and we are looking with renewed vigor to the new year.\"The aforementioned Ursual von Karsdorff also mentions something else. Because of her status as an official journalist with the ministry of propaganda, she had access to foreign newspapers, which she stole and read on the toilet of the ministry. On New Year's Eve she read the report of Auschwitz in a Czech newspaper. While the camp hadn't been liberated at the time, reports had made their way in the hands of the Allies, especially thanks to the Polish government in exile. Karsdorff wrote in her diary: \"Apparently that is the place where the Jews are gassed. They are lead into what looks like a bath and gas enters the room through what looks like showers.\" When celebrating New Year's with a friend of her that evening, it is not just the falling bombs that take up their conversation but also Auschwitz.Also writing in her diary, Lilo G. at the time pupil at a Berlin High School  but evacuated to Saxony wrote: \"I will never marry.

Whilst Pepsi had existed for practically the entirety of Cokes history they were never a large threat to the dominance of Coke after WWII. However this changed in the mid 70s with Pepsi running two well known ad campaigns. The first was the Pepsi Challenge with featured a blind taste test which showed that people preferred Pepsi to Coke. The second was an aggressive celebrity endorsement with the likes of Michael Jackson which pitched Pepsi as The choice of the new generation. As these campaigns were successful and the market share for Pepsi grew Coke knew they had to hit back. So they got food scientests to look into what was it that made people say the liked Pepsi and the answer they came up with was that Pepsi was sweeter then coke. So once they knew that they came up with a new sweeter version of Coke called New Coke that according to their own tests was preferred to both Pepsi and Old Coke. Now as to why it was a failure there are two reasons that people give. The first is Nostalgia, Coke was a drink with a long history and very little had changed with it since it was first created. Coke underestimated just how much some people loved the original product and how upset they would be with old cokes complete removal. The second reason is that the taste test that both companies ran were not accurate in reflecting what people liked. In all these tests only a small sample of the product was given not an amount you would actually drink. What this meant was that people would pick the sweeter drink even though if they were given a full can they might go with the other choice.The third option is one I do not agree with but I do need to mention it.

Seriously. I don't. Like Shikoku, Ky\u016bsh\u016b, and Odawara campaigns before them, they involved (semi-)independent forces from large areas of Japan. It was due to circumstances, political as well as military, these forces were concentrated on one battlefield for battle. Imagine if half, or even a quarter, of the armed forces of the Spanish Empire suddenly decided to concentrate at Madrid for a show down, well that would be a gigantic battle as well. Individual daimyos usually can only mobilize in the thousands (the smallest daimyos not even), and only the largest of daimyos could mobilize more than 20,000. Ieyasu, *by far* the largest daimyo present at Sekigahara, brought only 20,000 to 30,000 men. Now he did hope to have 40,000 to 60,000 men, but on a military decision he sent his son off with a separate army, and his son didn't arrive in time.As explained [here](_URL_0_), the Japanese did not mobilize a larger percent of its population for war than Europe. Or, at least, some European polities mobilized as much, or more, men as a percentage of its population compared to Japan. So it's not like European states did not have the ability to engage in such gigantic battles.

The more complex (and I would say *interesting* answer) is that the experience is *actually* far more common in London today as a result of local authority reforms and gentrification. This muddying is compounded by the fact that much of our popular imagination of Victorian crime today is coloured through an unhelpful stereotyped lens, an warped popular imagination which interestingly was shared.So did this ever happen? This needs to be addressed on two fronts: *were there areas which geographical proximity between rich and poor were so sharp that this could happen?* And *were there such things as 'no go areas' in the 1850s?***Were there areas of geographical proximity where such a situation could occur?**Generally London was far more socially divided than today. This is of course a generalisation and there were some exceptions (which I will explore in due course) however generally property values and thus residents were dependent on the feeling of an area. Too much in the way of poor surroundings would lead to a flight of wealthier individuals to reliable neighbourhoods such as Bloomsbury or Kensington. This is best captured by Gillian Tindall's exquisite *The Fields Beneath* as well as Dickens' *Dombey and Son* with the micro-history of the North London suburb of Kentish Town. Originally a it was a well heeled neighborhood by virtue of this 'Goldilocks spot' far enough away from the city to be rural but close enough for ease of access. There was a slight lurch downmarket as the city encroached and the upper class fled further north, however the reputation of wealth and sophistication brought a townhouse-dwelling upper-middle-class group who was needed in the city but preferred the genteel environs. What followed in the 1840s was the enterprising Southampton family built a new housing estate in the lands of the old Manor. Without amenities and despite middle class pretensions it quickly descended into a poorer neighborhood (mainly as houses were sold on a 21 year lease, meaning there was no real incentive for builders to build quality or resilient housing). This was further aggravated by the near simultaneous arrival of the trains to the area, noisy, dirty and entirely unbecoming that they were. Following on from this the response from the existing residents was predictable - and wonderfully recorded in the local press for example one resultant court case which reached the national audience of the Daily Telegraph read:*[Mr Pyke alleged] during five or six years he had been annoyed or sneered at by the defendants who looked impudently at him and did other acts to cause him pain.... There was also hooting yelling and cock-crowing... On Sundays some of the defendants and others used to sit upon the wall drinking and smoking*You can just smell the handwringing! This was followed by an extraordinary flight of the wealthier classes from the perceived downturn of the areas respectability. With one or two this soon turned to a flood as Englishmen looked at their property, saw the diminishing value caused by proximity to the rabble and escaped. The local workhouse by 1855 was double its 500 maximum size and church records from St Pancras parish shows the poor law system cracking at the seams under the weight of the influx, indeed there was a cholera epidemic in the area in 1866 - that very Victorian of privations. Indeed the shift in residents' occupations is telling. We go from Barristers to clerks and workers over the space of 40 years - a lower-middle-class and urban poor mix which Kentish Town is only starting to shrug off today with gentrification.Generally this pattern was replicated in most areas in London, with an area's, and its resident's identity profoundly intermingled with the aggregate wealth and sophistication of its residents. There are numerous examples of the same sort of middle and upper class flight from previously wealthy areas, such as Camberwell and Islington. This all points to the inherent division between rich and poor being maintained, with the wealthier occupying the more central areas around Bloomsbury, Kensington, Fulham, parts of Richmond, Chelsea and Covent Garden. As a matter of course there were relatively few opportunities to live in these areas if poor - pushed away by the rents, self aware landlords and the fact that the local poor law offices were all appointed from within the community, and thus having more than a smidge of self-interest.There were of course exceptions, two of the larger ones were St. Pancras and East London. Bloomsbury was a very well to do area full of multiple story townhouses and large signature buildings for the Crown estate and Southampton family. This was known as the 'Gravel district' as its earth contained sediment from the wandering Thames, making it ideal for building. Even walking around this area today, around the British Museum and University quarter demonstrates its wealth. On the edge of this Gravel district was built New Road (now Euston Road) with the full intent that this would be the edge of the city. However it did not take long for enterprising and less scrupulous builders to start building on the other side on the soft London clay. These houses were smaller by virtue of the geology and poorer quality by virtue of the 21 year lease habitually offered by landowners (mostly Oxford Colleges) in the area. It is again unsurprising therefore this turned rapidly into a slum district, just over the road from well heeled Bloomsbury. Interestingly, such was the marked difference and seemingly the psychological effect of the New Road barrier that we don't really see the same downward mobility of the area that we saw in Kentish Town. I have always found this interesting as (and mods please forgive the anecdote) that as an until-recent Special Constable in Camden this divide between well heeled residents on Bloomsbury and grinding slum-poverty-criminality (now in the rebuilt Somers town estate) is as evident and as sharp as ever today, in part due to the geology of London!The other example is East London. This was a slum district to begin with which then had spurts of well-heeled property (the best example - because I lived near it - is [Tredegar Square](_URL_0_) This is more due to the lengthier leases offered and the relatively cheap quality of land. Both offered inducements to opportunistic builders attempting to build city-manors for the financial district but a mile or two away. However despite this it was generally a failure and while wealthier patrons were there, and perhaps this sort of thing fits best in your description (as the expected slum clearance and expansion did not happen) Tredegar Square and similar developments remained surrounded by poor quality slum docker's housing but a street or two away. These  were exceptions and never had the really wealthy residents as they could see what the area was and afford to live elsewhere, instead these tended to be occupied by second-rung pretensions of wealth and members of the faded aristocracy. So overall while there were exceptions the self-awareness the wealthy in the era had for the aggregate wealth and sophistication of their area meant that we had large islands of wealth with little in the way of blunt extremes. Any encroachment of London poverty would almost always lead to a rout to more reliably wealthy areas. There were exceptions but not that many and usually very locally-dependent.*Continued underneath*", "label": 0}, {"content": "In \"The Great Train Robbery,\" Michael Crichton describes wealth and poverty in 1850s London as being so closely juxtaposed that a thief could rob a mansion and cross the street into neighborhood the police wouldn't want to enter; how close to reality is that?", "label": 1}, {"content": "I'm not at all qualifed to give you a great answer, but I'm a fairly regular reader of this subreddit.

A *little*, which I'll touch on, but it seems to have been quite muted. Even by the time that the statue had arrived in the US, it had shifted from the red-brown copper it had shown off in Paris to a pure brown as the patination had begun (Thanks to /u/ducatimechanic [here](_URL_1_), this is a [guide](_URL_0_) to visualize the change). It was fully expected that patination would occur, and for that matter, *important* that it would. Although Bartholdi apparently had hoped it would end up in a bronzed color, the statue staying its natural copper would be awful for it, structurally, and in restoration work that has happened, it has been important not to disturb the patina, because it is a layer of protection against the elements, which helps prevent further corrosion. Removing it, or worse, maintaining a continual cleaning schedule to prevent it at all, would just mean the copper would just continue to deteriorate away! This was of great concern in the '80s when a massive restoration effort was underway, especially when a cleaner being used on the interior seeped out and started to dissolve the patina in places, which workers had to quickly work to stop. Checking through what literature I can find, the real issue concerning restoration has always been focused around who pays for it. The Statue of Liberty proved to be a somewhat awkward gift that left the US Government in a quandary, unsure quite what to do with it, and as such it fell into an administrative quagmire of competing jurisdictions. The National Lighthouse Board, the US Army, and the American Committee (the group which had fund-raised for the pedestal and operated ferries to visit), for various reasons, all had some level of responsibility, but also all insisted that the other groups were the ones who should be maintaining it. A 1890 bill was defeated in Congress that would have made is a public park maintained by the Federal government, and it wasn't until another decade had passed that Congress agreed to a small one time expenditure of $62,800, which was enough to do some interior painting and install the elevator, but hardly enough to anything more substantial, or long-lasting. Now, to be sure, there was a good deal of public concern about this, and a number of newspapers, starting within a few years of the statue's arrival, decried this, but it doesn't seem to be about the color. As already noted, the patina plays an important role in preservation, and the only articles I could find from the time which makes reference to any calls to strip the patina are focused on explaining why it would be a bad idea! There were *some* people saying it should happen, but one author, writing in 1910, makes it fairly clear it was a proposal that was ignored: > The patina is the rust on bronze, which, however, does not, like the rust on iron, corrode the metal. It is green in color, the exact shade depending on the amount of alloy used with the copper to form the bronze. It is formed by the statue gathering from the atmosphere carbon and sulpher, and in the formation of nitrate copper crystals on the surface. > \"In the case of the Statue of Liberty on Bedloe's Island\" said Mr. [Gutzon] Borglum, \"the continuous washing of the wain and the spray keeps it clean. I should have gone to Washington, if necessary, if the proposal to take away its patina had been likely to be adopted a year or so ago. People said then that it was eating into the metal, and that in certain placed the bronze was rent away. All I can say is, if there are any thin places they are the result of flaws in the original casting.\"So again, as this suggests, there was clearly *some people* calling for the patina to be stripped, but from the start, experts were making clear that it was not needed, and a bad idea. An earlier article, from 1903, is even further in praise of the green, noting that of burgeoning hue at that point: > Kindly nature has been spinning for her a fine cobwebby outer raiment or verdanlique, deeper in one place, lighter in another. Snows and stinging hail, fogs and rainstorms have been gently removing the repulsive newness of her bronze and streaking cheek and uplifted arm, draperies and crown with tender shades or green such as the cleverest bronze rounders try to produce with chemicals on their new 'castings, but never quite succeed in simulating.The author further warns against any voices which might \"*shriek wildly for scrubbing brush and Putz-powder\"*, not just for the writer's aesthetic tastes, but also again for the protective covering the patina offers. The editorial also calls for the appointment of a 'keeper of public monuments', specifically to ensure ignorance doesn't result in the destruction of monuments, not just 'Lady Liberty', a position which seems to have at least somewhat come about by 1910, as that seems to be the role Gutzon Borglum was assisting in by then. Additionally, as before, this suggests the existence of those who desired a de-greening, but again that despite their existence, it was a call which experts pushed back against.One related thing I did find, which I would also make mention of, was a call not for a stripping down to the natural copper color, but instead to paint it! An article in 1906 makes mention of such a proposal, and again the author instead favors the \"marvelous harmony of blended colors\" from the \"varying shades of light green, delicate white, and a subtle dash of yellow\" which by that point have almost entirely overtaken the bronzed hues. The proposal had been written up in several papers, but at least as presented in this article, but was clearly not in an advanced stage of planning. Capt. George Burnell, in command on the island for the War Department, mentioned to the author the \"bushels of letters\", almost all of which were aghast at the proposal - which additionally helps to point to the acceptance of the green quite quickly - and additionally talks to copper experts who find the idea not only unnecessary, but quite ludicrous. Unfortunately I was unable to find the original announcement, but it is certainly clear enough that it all came to naught.Anyways though, to continue with this more general over view of restoration, during the Wilson Administration, a Public-Private partnership with the *World* newspaper saw another $30,000 from the government, but again, it was a one time expenditure, and this time for installing flood-lights. Lights which, lacking maintenance funds, had mostly ceased working by 1930.This funding morass continued through the 1930s, when it finally was moved to the jurisdiction of the National Park Service, as part of a larger push under the FDR administration, in step with the New Deal, to give 'Lady Liberty' her due as a symbol of the country. Unable to get the funds solely on its own, between 1937 and 1941 the NPS worked in conjunction with the PWA and WPA to give the statue its first real overhaul, a $1.5 million dollar makeover which involved clearing the entire island of buildings to start fresh, building a seawall, a new dock, walkways, and most importantly much needed maintenance of the internal iron structure - although not quite extensive enough - which was becoming quite rusted at points, thanks to the salty seawater surrounding it. Much was done, but of course the outbreak of war in late 1941 brought it to a halt. Work would resume again in 1946 to wrap up work unfinished in '41, but over the next decade or so, the real focus with funding was on the creation of an American Museum of Immigration, which would eventually open in 1972 after a long and fraught 'battle'.By 1981, even the work done by the NPS decades earlier was showing its age, and spurred by an analysis by French architects, a renewed focus on a *thorough* overhaul of the statue, especially in light of the upcoming centennial, began to be planned, perhaps most famously with American Express donating a penny for every purchase made with their card to the endeavor, resulting in $1.7 million dollars. Closed to the public in 1984 for the work - and as noted above, careful not to disturb the green! - the work was completed in time for the \"Liberty Weekend\" centennial celebration in 1986, with President Reagan turning on the floodlights the night of July 3rd, and the statue officially reopened on the 5th.Berenson, Edward. \"*The Statue of Liberty: A Transatlantic Story*\" New Haven: Yale University Press, 2012\"BRONZE MONUMENTS IN PERIL.\" *New York Times*, May 18, 1903. \"How Shall \"Miss Liberty's\" Toilet be made?\" *New York Times*, Jul 29, 1906.\"SPRING CLEANING FOR CITY STATUES.\" *New York Times*, Mar 03, 1910.ProQuest News and Newspapers Database, Various SearchesETA: A few more articles to flesh things out.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Statue of Liberty was originally copper, but it has since developed a green patina.

However, even at it's maximum potential the Nazi state simply could not industrialize on the scale of the USA or USSR. Additionally, the initial re-armament was only made possible through massive, incredible distortion of the economy. Not only did the Nazis devote an unsustainable about of gdp on military, but they also used 'funny money' internally (MEFO bills) and all of their hard currency reserves externally. Once those were gone, the only additional hard currency they could get was by confiscating the wealth of Jews and looting their conquests, neither of which is obviously a sustainable income source. He argues that they almost had no other choice but to go to war before the bills came due. Without the ability to pay for resources or to cover their debt, the only option was to seize them. This led, almost inevitably to a negative feedback loop. Their rapacious behavior, not to mention their 'ideological quirks' so to say, meant that their conquests would never be secure,subject to resistance and sabotage. For example, Tooze claims that when the Reich finally managed to send some engineers to take a look at exploiting the Caucasian oilfields, they were all assassinated in their beds. Despite the massive territory the fascists controlled on paper, it's said that in the East in particular, their control was limited to the roads and the ground soldiers were standing on at any particular moment. The ever-increasing drain on manpower meant that more and more laborers and craftsmen, of higher and higher importance became liable for the draft and had to be replaced with slave labor, with obvious implications for domestic security, not to mention productivity and quality. As if all that wasn't enough, despite the popular image of a Hyper-efficent scientific fascist state, the internal decision-making looked more like something out of \"game of thrones\" than a sterile technocratic state. Hitler played favorites and set factions against each other. Each military branch competed with the others for resources. Himmler and Goering tried to build personal armies at the expense of the other branches. Industrial concerns were set against each other, producing competing designs for the same role out of the same pool of labor and resources. Hitler would favor one, then the other, and then the next day discard them both in favor of whatever weapon he decided was the \"war-winner\" that day. Production drives switched from ammo, to artillery, to submarines, to tanks of ever-increasing impracticality, to wonder-weapons ranging from the merely ineffective to downright counterproductive. Hitler and his favorites would personally interfere with designs, insisting on adding more armor and ever-larger guns to designs that already strained under their own weight, or insisting that a heavy bomber have dive capability, or that a jet-fighter be used as a bomber for 'revenge attacks'. Designs were rushed into production with inadequate testing, forcing men at the front to be \"beta testers\"- Kursk was delayed so that the brand-new panther could be rushed to the front, allowing the Soviets to set up a defensive line unprecedented in modern warfare, and when they finally showed up, two caught on fire simply from being unloaded from the train, and only a handful were still running after a week of battle. Each tank off the production line was practically a bespoke variant as bugs had to be worked out day by day, in comparison to the USSR and US who limited production to proven, standardized designs. This is where the myth of nazi super-science comes from- they pushed experimental projects into the front line regardless of practicality, reliability or effectiveness. The nazis would look at some impractical paper design or test project and say \"yeah, that's what we need, build that tomorrow, take all these workers building these lame Stugs or pz4s or boring old rifles\"  whereas the allies would say \"hey, that's cool, let us know when you've ironed out the bugs and its ready for production\".

CBS News' Ed Bradley was one of those evacuated at the embassy, and described: > \"Once inside the compound, for the Americans and those Vietnamese who managed to get in with legal documents and the many who managed entrance without, the rest was easy. It was just a matter of waiting your turn for a helicopter to take you to one of the ships on station off the Vietnamese coast.\"With Martins having ordered that only Americans be evacuated earlier that dawn, we can deduce that likely no Vietnamese were granted access to the last round of helicopter flights out to sea.As PAVN troops were assaulting downtown Saigon at the same time, and with South Vietnam unconditionally surrendering at 10:24, we can deduce that few South Vietnamese decided to stick around at the embassy for the three hours after the last helicopter left.The following days, PAVN forces consolidated their control in Ho Chi Minh City, with the Embassy and other government buildings being raided.  Afterwards, as stated in the Texas Tech Vietnam Oral History Interview of Phong Xuan Nguyen (a former South Vietnamese government official who was imprisoned for five years in a reeducation canp): > It was decreed that all the high ranking officials\rof the former Saigon regime would have to report for re-education for a period of thirty\rdays...Nguyen describes that his reeducation was later extended as he had been a very high ranked official.

It was completely empty, the orphanage was\rcompletely empty, no furniture whatsoever and there were buildings with aluminum sheet\rroofing and it was just tiles, very primitive tiles as the floor. We slept on the floor and\rthe food was provided twice a day, lunch and dinner by the administration, very primitive\rtoo but we had rice.Nguyen interestingly mentions that although familial visits were not allowed, the guards were actually South Vietnamese, who treated the prisoners very courteously.Nguyen was later moved to a prison camp in North Vietnam, where all prisoners were directed to write a 'self-confession'.  Nguyen was later put to work alongside other prisoners; he, specifically, became a mason and designed decorative ceramics.  Other prisoners might be assigned to work in the fields or in other craftsmen roles.  He was paid a small allowance as well.All in all, I doubt that any Vietnamese were arrested at the Embassy, but if they were high ranking officials, they likely were imprisoned in reeducation camps for anywhere between thirty days and five years.I took the Fall of Saigon timeline information from Olivier Todd's *Cruel April* and the interview from Texas Tech's Vietnam Archive", "label": 0}, {"content": "The last helicopter out of Saigon landed at the American Embassy in the late afternoon of April 30, 1975.

This word means 'island'. Think of it as a metaphor for how the insulae rise up from a 'sea of streets' to provide habitation for the lower and middle classes.Insulae were owned, in full or in part, by wealthy individuals and were usually seen as investment properties. One would not 'purchase' a unit within an insula any more than one would 'purchase' a room within a hotel. If your family wasn't rich enough to own a *domus* (a house), you would have to make do with an apartment in an insula. To give an idea of the rarity of home ownership: in the 4^th Century there were roughly 44,000 insulae in Rome's city limits but only 1,700 domus.Units on the ground floor, called *tabernae* (the origin of the word 'tavern'), would open onto the street and would be rented by merchants. Such market stalls [can be seen in Pompeii](_URL_8_). These could be anything: a lawyer's office, a restaurant, a jeweller, a liquor store.If your building was fancy it would have a public latrine attached to it. This would be used by residents on upper floors, perhaps even by residents of neighbouring buildings. A public latrine would have been a long bench with many holes in it. If you looked through the holes you'd see a gutter with a constant stream of water rushing along it, carrying waste away. If you looked around you you'd see a large crowd of men and women chatting: latrines were a common social gathering place. There would also be sticks next to each seat. These would look something like the toilet brushes that we use to clean our toilets today. You would use this brush to scrub yourself when you were finished. If someone put the stick back into its holder facing the wrong way, you'd get shit on your hand when you grabbed it. This is supposedly the origin of the phrase \"getting the wrong end of the stick\" (and its variants).The lower floors of the insula would feature central heating, indoor plumbing, sound walls, and spacious accommodation. The higher the floor, the fewer the amenities, the thinner the walls, and the smaller the rooms. Unlike today, it was desirable to live as close to street level as possible: living on the top floor of an insula meant many flights of stairs, cold winters, hot summers, and a complete reliance on restaurants and public latrines for basic human needs.Owners of insulae often had callous disregard for their more impoverished occupants; shoddy construction was the norm on higher floors and fatal collapses were commonplace. Augustus restricted the height of insulae to ~20.7 metres; Nero later lowered this height to ~17.75 metres. Insulae were never more than nine storeys high. The [Insula Felicles](_URL_0_) (the \"Happy Isles Apartments\") is an example of one of the tallest. A hand points to it in this close-up of a model of Rome.[Here](_URL_10_) are some images from Pompeii to show how the walls of some of these units were decorated. Note that in this particular case (Insula 9) only the lowest level of the building has been preserved. This means that the units represented on this website were the largest and most richly appointed.**Edit:** On the subject of the Insula Felicles, one of the tallest insulae in Rome: Tertullian, a Christian writer, had some rather nasty things to say about the pagans in \"Against the Valentinians\". He uses the Insula Felicles in a metaphor, which I'll quote from [this source](_URL_2_). >  Ennius, the Roman poet, was the first to mention (with a straightforward meaning) \"the great halls of heaven,\" because of its lofty position or because he had read in Homer of Jupiter's feasting there. Now as for the heretics--it is a marvel how many pinnacles on pinnacles and towers on towers they hang, add, develop on the house of each god of theirs. Well, perhaps even for our creator these Ennian halls have been distributed like apartments. Perhaps they have various shops built on in front and assigned to each god by floors--as many floors as there are heresies. In this way the world becomes an apartment house; indeed, you might think the celestial flats are the Happy Isles Apartments, located somewhere. There even the Valentinian god lives--in the penthouse.**Recalling, of course, what it means to live 'in the penthouse'. ;)* /u/kwonza asked a follow-up question that I answered [here](_URL_4_).* /u/theGentlemanInWhite asked another follow-up question that I answered [here](_URL_6_)* There are many follow-up questions below this answer, read them all!**Gold?

For example, an actual Jonson's (that would be Ben) play \"Bartholomew Fair\" had some fun: >  Quarlous: His Christian name is Zeal-of-the-land?  >  Littlewit: Yes, sir; Zeal-of-the-land Busy.  >  Winwife: How! What a name's there!  >  Littlewit: Oh, they all have such names, sir: he was witness for Win here--they will not be called godfathers--and named her Win- the-fight: you thought her name had been Winnifred, did you not ?  >  Winwife: I did indeed.  >  Littlewit. He would have thought himself a stark reprobate if it had.Elsewhere, Jonson lays waste to biblical buzzword names like Tribulation, Restraint, and Long-patience.In the early and post-Restoration 17th century, unwieldly biblical and Bible-ish phrases as names bore the brunt of jokes. Most of this was driven by anti-puritan/nonconformist sentiment or the good politics of being anti-puritan in public, since \"Job-rakt-by-the-ashes\" and similar names were strongly associated with puritans. But they weren't exclusive to it, as *Sir* Faithful Fortescue (and his son Faithful and his nephew Faithful...) shows. The point is, the focal point of ostracizing and ridiculing religious noncomformity provided a cultural shorthand for mockable names.Even some of those sympathetic to puritans--as David Como argues, we need to talk about a spectrum rather than a distinct sect even before the English Civil War--seem to have viewed the names as a shade of ridiculousness, as minister Thomas Adams did in 1629: >  it is a petulant absurdity to give [children] ridiculous names, the very rehearsing whereof causeth laughter. There be certain affectate names which mistaken zeal chooseth for honour, but the event discovers a proud singularity....as if they would tie the goodness of the person to the signification of the name. But still a man is what he is, not what he is called; he were the same, with or without that title or that name. And we have known Williams and Richards, names not found in sacred story, but familiar to our country, prove as gracious saints as any Safe-deliverance, Fight-the-good-fight-of-faith or such like, which have been rather descriptions than names.In contrast, Jo(h)n Jo(h)nson is a name that pops up frequently in the Calendar of State Papers volumes released by the British PRO for the 17th century. Just as a sample, the 1637 volume mentions two distinct John Johnsons; the 1629 one also mentions two. They seem to come from a variety of social levels. One of our 1637 mentions is a new arrival to London. A 1629 representative is a university fellow.Although John Johnson (\"spelled variously\", says the index) appears to have been the most common double, I did find some Richard Richardsons as well.All of this is to say: mere incidence of the name--even though given the limited sample, the number of John Johnson is probably significant--isn't enough to say people *didn't* do a double-take at the pseudonym. After all, the pattern of puritan names being mocked had roots in people's actual, baptismal-record names, too.However, if Fawkes had intended to be ridiculous, he had a whole barn of name options to choose from that would have been instantly and acceptably recognized as such in popular culture. Instead, he picked a name with a reasonable amount of currency in London at different levels of society.Further Reading:* If you haven't yet, hie thee to Charles Bardsley's *[Curiosities of Puritan Nomenclature](_URL_0_)*. Yes, it's from 1888, and full-blown antiquarian: he catalogues and marvels at the names, rather than performing trenchant cultural-religious analysis as to their purpose and use. (A modern scholar on the topic, for example, would analyze the *snot* out of that Adams quote for what it says about clerics versus laity and popular religious practice  &  morality; Bardsley just drops it in.

I think India stands as an example where same sex relationships and gender variance are permitted through culturally prescribed avenues (such as \"hijra\" traditions or the traditions of ritualized male friendships or \"miths\"). India is a good example where there is sexual freedom to the extent that this behavior/discussion does not extent that it does not interfere with public duties, enter into discourse, or take the shape of subjective and fixed identities (with perhaps exception of Hijras). There is a large percentage of men in India who have had same sex relationships; the difference between India, and say America, is that in India this is acceptable so long as these men do not identify publicly and, perhaps more importantly, politically as \"gay men.\" Indeed, the term \"men who have sex with men\" arose because many of these men reject such labeling, which comes from Eurocentric understanding of sexuality as fixed and limited to a set of prescribed behaviors concerning attraction to certain genders. Men often describe their relationships to other men not necessarily as sexual but as \"masti,\" meaning fun, that serves to help \"release\" the build of male sexual energy, something that is also consider \"natural\" to men's sexuality. Comments concerning the impact of colonialism are important in this discussion. The British Raj did indeed impose Victorian standards of sexuality through law, policy, etc. and this no doubt has left an impact on the nation. However, to say that this completely overwrote or replaced older, pre-colonial understandings of sexuality is an overstatement. The current statute outlawing sodomy was gifted to India by none other than the British. Portrayals of Indian men, by the British and by Gandhi, also to some extent also emasculated the imagine of the Indian man and the reaction to which can be seen in hyper-masculinized Hindu nationalist portrayals of the nation, of Ram, of Hinduism, etc. Additionally, imaging the production of the Kama Sutra with a cultural that is \"sexually liberal\" enough to have carvings of sex is also problematic. Tantric and the antinomian traditions that were developing around the same time weren't not necessarily wide spread teachings that represented or even concerned the majority of population at the time. Indeed, even the fact that the Sutra was a sutra (that is to suggest a text to be read) suggests the amount of people who had access to it were far less than the majority of the population (since they would have to be literate.) Many tantric practices were esoteric, secret, and while they did affect and change many cultures, rituals, etc. it's not fair to assume that any given text represents the entire continent of India's understanding of sexuality at that time. Source - I am a researcher who studies sexual and gender minorities in South Asia.Edit - A lot of people are getting crabby about the sources.

First, although Japan did lose four aircraft carriers at Midway, they did not lose them all at once. *Kido Butai* (the IJN carrier force) lost three carriers (*Akagi*,*Kaga*, and *Soryu*) in a series of dive-bombing attacks over the course of a few minutes at 1025. The fourth carrier, *Hiryu*, was unmolested and launched a counterattack against the USN. This  aggressive and somewhat foolish move guaranteed *Hiryu*'s later destruction during a USN counterstrike later that evening at 1700. The second point is that the majority of the *Kido Butai*'s  planes aloft at 1025 were the combat air patrol (CAP) A6M2s. These fighter planes were tasked with the defense of the Japanese fleet and had already given a decent account of themselves in decimating the USN torpedo attacks on *Kido Butai*. The general estimate from Jonathan Parshall and Antony Tully's *Shattered Sword* was that the IJN CAP at 1010 was thirty-six fighters which would soon be augmented to forty-two. What the above means for the OP's question was that there was plenty of time for a number of CAP fighters to land on the intact *Hiryu*. *Shattered Sword* estimates that *Hiryu* took on twenty-seven refugees, all of them fighters save for one strike aircraft straggler from the morning's attack on Midway atoll. This ensured that *Hiryu* had a fairly robust CAP through the evening but a somewhat anemic striking arm. The fate of other sixteen CAP aircraft that did not land on *Hiryu* is a bit more murky. No doubt the USN shot down some of the fighters  and the aircraft went missing. Both USN fighter escorts and rear gunners did make claims of A6Ms and although such claims cannot be taken at face value due to the confusion of air combat, the USN undoubtedly did shoot down some of the Japanese CAP. *Soryu*'s fighter ace Fujita Iyozo had to bail out because of damage and he drifted in the water in his kapok lifevest  for some four hours until a spotter on the destroyer *Nowaki* sighted him. Some of CAP also ditched next to smaller Japanese ships like destroyers. This was a standard IJN practice and *Kido Butai*'s carriers usually had a destroyer detached as a plane guard on operations. A number of the damaged aircraft from the morning's strike on Midway ditched rather than try to make a landing. *Hiryu*'s post-1700 CAP of around fourteen A6M2s likewise ditched. There are records of nine fighters ditching and being rescued by surface ships, ironically none of the rescued crew were from *Hiryu*.   Contrary to the popular historical memory that Midway devastated IJN aircrew, the IJN personnel losses from Midway were severe, but not catastrophic. Surviving manifests from *Kido Butai* show that only *Hiryu* and *Kaga*'s air groups suffered from massive losses among pilots and aircrew. IJN carrier doctrine was different than the USN in that pilots were seldom manning their planes until they had been spotted on the deck. While Fuchida Mitsuo relayed the tale of *Kido Butai* aircraft awaiting takeoff prior to the 1025 attack, this was a fabrication. Photographic evidence from the B-17 attacks two hours prior to the dive-bombing attack show nearly-empty flight decks and it would have taken a herculean effort for the Japanese to arm, fuel, and spot a strike package in that amount of time between the B-17 attacks and the 1025 dive-bombings. The 1025 bombings did extract a heavy toll among fitters and other maintenance personnel, which were losses the IJN found difficult to replace, but a good many of *Kido Butai*'s aviators were away from the conflagrations and escaped their carriers' fate. Some like Egusa Takashige were injured from the attacks, but others like Fujita were not. Again, contrary to popular stereotypes, the IJN initially filtered the Midway survivors into training or instructor positions. The aggressive Fujita lamented this policy as it denuded frontline units of experienced personnel. The real problem was the material losses at the front outstripped Japan's ability to replace them, so many of these survivors had to be filtered back into combat, often as the replacement chiefs for other units. Fujita for example became *Hiyo*'s  divisional officer and Egusa went from leading dive bombers to commanding the 521 *Kokutai*, a shore-based unit of twin-engined Yokusuka P1Y1 strike aircraft, after his recovery. This was the general pattern for other Midway survivors in which they usually were promoted on the basis of experience to reconstituted or new units, but their experience could not make good on the growing qualitative and quantitative inferiority of Japanese airpower vs-\u00e0-vis the American enemy that was apparent by the end of 1942.

Trotsky himself, a long time Menshevik prior to 1917 (the democratic socialist faction which competed with the Bolsheviks for control of the Soviets), had long been an advocate for more democratic-oriented socialist practice, as opposed even to Lenin.  Trotsky helped to author The Declaration of 46 in the wake of Lenin's decline and the rise of the Stalinst right-wing faction, which critiqued the lack of democracy within the party and the rise of bureaucratic authoritarianism resulting from the divorce of party delegates from the masses (during the civil war delegates began to be appointed rather than elected). Trotsky was also highly critical of Stalin's deification of Lenin, revision of history, cult of personality, and of the summary executions and purges undertaken by Stalin against almost all original Bolshevik leaders in the revolution. The Trotskyist critique of Stalin's theory of Socialism in One Country arguably also anticipated and opposed the authoritarian tactics that would come to be adopted by Stalin and other oppressive Marxist-Leninist regimes to come. Sources: Trotsky's biography of Stalin - this is a great and fascinating first hand look into the devolution of the party into Stalinism over the long term. Obviously, it's biased, as Trotsky is the one who wrote it, but he clearly lays out policy and theoretical differences between Stalin and Lenin/other original party members. It is well sourced as well, and he does a good job establishing an extent of objectivity.Rabinowitch's The Bolsheviks Come to Power shows the surprisingly lively and open debates occurring in the party up to the Revolution, where challenges to Lenin's positions were the norm - a far cry from the party under Stalin.

Astrolabes and sundials were among the more precise methods. Scholars produced books of tables calculating prayer times throughout the year or at different latitudes. Texts waver between denouncing the \"uneducated\" muezzins who rely on the angle of shadows during the day, and teaching muezzins how to use the angles of midday shadows to announce prayers.Medieval Christian monks, who also had to keep time throughout the night to pray the Divine Office at appropriate times, also had someone standing watch throughout the night. I mention them here because Latin Europe is where I'm familiar with the procedure for *cloudly* nights. When the sky was obscured, medieval monks and nuns kept time by chanting psalms. My educated guess is that in similar situations, medieval muezzins would have chanted suras or prayers.So the observant muezzin had a good deal of information in front of his eyes to know when to announce prayer. So how to ensure an observant muezzin at all times?Simple: have more than one. When we look at salary records for mosques and *khanaqah*s (Sufi \"lodges\" or group houses/schools), which are sometimes included in foundation/endowment documents, we find one person endowed/salaried to teach Quran, one person endowed to teach one school of Islamic law, one person endowed to teach another school.

Yet.I'd like to talk about *why*.Reichert and Richardson's (R & R 2012) article \"Decline of a Moral Panic: A Social Psychological and Socio-Legal Examination of the CurrentStatus of Satanism\" is actually about the *survival* of fears of Satanism, played out in custodial and other court cases. When it comes to the actual decline, they write: >  As with any moral panic, reasons for the declineare unclear. One proposed explanation involved the discrediting of so-called \u201crepressed memories\u201d of Satanic ritual abuse in trials of the late1980s and 1990s, in which victims would recant their charges and prosecutors would fail to produce adult witnesses or corroborating physicalevidence. Some cases even resulted in successful suits against therapistswho allegedly had planted memories in clients. >  The failure to achieveconvictions in some high profile Satanism-related cases, such as theMcMartin trial, may have contributed to the decline of moral panic. >  The decline also coincided with the emergence of new concerns such asterrorism after the September 11 attacks in 2001, which may have helpedsupplant Satanism as a significant public fear.(I'll get to D & D specifically, I promise.)Stanley Cohen (Cohen 1972, 1987, 2002), the foundational theorist on \"moral panic\" in the first place, had two key points about the decline of moral panics:1. \"Volatility \u2013 the panic erupts and dissipates suddenlyand without warning\" is one of the five defining characteristics of a moral panic. (He points to illogical fears of immigrants as the big exception.)2. \"First, why do full-blown panics ever end? My original answers wereonly guess-work.\" His answers for possibilities were: \"a 'natural history' of moral panics\"--i.e. that's just how they are; people are convinced by rational data that there is no there there; the thing gets commodified/absorbed by respectable society. That's in 2002 revisiting his 1972 and 1987 work. He...does not go on to offer updated ideas: \"No readily available explanation exists as to how and why thesequence ever ends.\"A second theory of moral panic, derived in large part from the works of Stuart Hall and Kenneth Thompson, suggests that \"moral panic\" is more or less an endemic state of society--however, its *focus* shifts. This theory also points to the fundamentally conservative and even regressive nature of moral panic(s): they focus on a situation perceived as out of control, deviant, needing restoration to a previous state.But even Cohen points out that any framework is unsatisfactory because it is sociological and \"a-historical,\" that is, it cannot explain why moral panics (or a phase of endemic moral panic) develop around a particular thing at a particular time and then fade away at a particular time.And that brings us to the problem: to this point, moral panics have been the focus primarily of scholars outside the field of history. Looking at the methodologies and explanations that have been posited do not actually address the root cause of a decline.Reichert is a psychologist; Richardson is a sociologist. The central thrust of their argument is that juries didn't convict people of SRA, and people started mistrusting therapists instead. (I don't know why on Earth they chose 9/11 as \"the next moral panic\" when, FFS, violent video games much?) They don't address crucial underlying questions: First, *why* were people suddenly willing to accept objective evidence/why was the media willing to report objective evidence or take a closer look?Second, why did the specific example of debunking SRA result in the decline of the overall *Satanic* panic?These two points are both relevant to one of the major recent works related to the Satanic panic, philosopher Joseph Laycock's *Dangerous Games: What the Moral Panic about Role\u2010Playing Games Says about Play, Religion, and Imagined Worlds* (**See? I told you I'd get there!**). Laycock focuses exclusively on RPG panic. Anti-D & D panic fizzled out in the early 1990s, he argues, because *anti-RPG panic* evolved into spurts of anti-White Wolf panic, on a much smaller scale, in the 1990s.Laycock's argument focuses specifically on the nature of RPGs as a perceived teenage, white, and male hobby. He argues that the introduction and popularity of White Wolf games like Vampire, Werewolf, Mage (he talks about a couple of GURPS variants as well) mirrored a shift in popular discourse towards the bleakness of human nature. He gives an overview of the development of the \"superpredator\" thesis, in which inherently corrupt (primarily) teenage boys are going increasingly out of control in a tidal wave of youth crime. Superpredators \"do not fear the stigma of arrest, the pains of imprisonment, or the pangs of conscience.\" (quoting Bennett et al., *Body Count: Moral Poverty and How to Win America\u2019s War against Crime and Drugs*). Importantly, as the idea developed in the early 1990s, this meant urban, lower-class, and above all black boys. (The parallel panic was the teenage mother, especially the teenage mother on welfare, who of course is never white.)The public connection between superpredators and RPGs, he suggests, was triggered by two phenomena. First, *white, middle-class* boys started being visible in the media for committing shocking crimes. Second, there were a handful of Shocking, Nice-White-Family Murdered cases in which the murderer had played *Vampire*, had been kicked out of a game of *Vampire*, or kinda maybe sorta thought they *were* a vampire.The book is fascinating and I absolutely recommend it (especially the analysis of the World of Darkness from a religious studies POV), but there's still a problem from a historians' view: context. Laycock isolates RPG panic from anti-heavy metal fears and from Satanic panic in general. But despite tracing a trajectory from D & D to WW outrage, he calls the 1996 burble of anti-WW media attention a revival or rebirth--not a historical continuation.There's a lot of research on how D & D became tied up in the panic over Satanism--but Laycock fails to consider this larger dimension when looking at the decline/evolution of anti-RPG panic. He says *that* fears of inherently bad superpredators eventually replaced fears of Satan corrupting boys--but not *why*.AskHistorians has a 20-year moratorium on questions. Part of this is that 9/11 is still less than 20 years away, and we plan to introduce a 21-year moratorium on Jan. 1, 2021 (just kidding...I think). But no, the real reason is historical perspective: we haven't had time to see all the implications and tendrils of a thing play out; we're too personally involved in whatever phenomenon we're studying. I think the decline of Satanic panic is a great example of this principle in action; I think Laycock's book, despite coming from a religious/cultural studies angle rather than history, is a sign that people are getting interested in deeper explanation.~~Additionally, there's a fairly recent edited volume on *Moral Panics, the Media, and the Law in Early Modern England* that's pretty explicit about being *historians* addressing moral panics. *Dangerous Games* is a better read, but this might interest some of you as well--especially from the perspective of mass media and, relevant to all of us reading this, I think, media *change*.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Satanic Panic of the 1980s, regarding heavy metal, Dungeons and Dragons, etc., ended with the publication of the \"Satanic Panic of the 1980s\" by the American Family Association in 1989.

This had been happening too much lately. He signed into his cup. He had been forced to return home from London *yet again* after a disastrous love affair with the actress Louisa Lewis. He has entered London full of high resolutions, writing in his journal \u201cI determined to have nothing to do with whores, as my health was of great consequence to me.\u201dLondon was the center of everything, of course. He could have anything he wanted, from \u201ca splendid Madam at fifty guineas a night down to the civil nymph ... who tramps along the Strand and will resign her engaging person to your honour for a pint of wine and a shilling.\u201d But unfortunately, the Laird of Auchinleck had never been a rich title, and he had never had much money. Unfortunately for Boswell, the one thing he had in spades was sexual energy\u2014and a tendency to catch gonorrhea. He had boasted to Rousseau (yes, that Rousseau) a year prior >  'If I am rich, I can take a number ofgirls. I get them with child, propagation is thus increased. I give them dowries and marry them off to good peasants who are very happy to have them. Thus they become wives at the same age as would have been the case if they had remained virgins, and I, on my side, have had the benefit ofenjoying a great variety of women. . . . I should like to follow the example of the old Patriarchs, worthy men whose memory I hold in respect.' Rousseau would have none of these ideas, telling Boswell that fleshly pleasures were ephemeral compared with spiritual ones and that virtue has its own reward, advice which the latter followed for about a month.So, he tried to compromise. He decided he would aim a little higher than a common street prostitute and decided to seduce Miss Lewis, who he found to be a fascinating and beautiful actress. Just like everyone else, he was aware that actresses had long been mistresses to the nobility of Britain and France. He had pressed her with presents and gifts, and one day while they chatted she asked to borrow two guineas from him.\u201cOh my darling,\u201d he had said, foolishly smitten \u201cyou may have all ten guineas that I have in my purse, and everything else I may own!\u201dHe laughed bitterly into his wine, remembering what he had written in his diary the night following--  although not cheap, \u201cit cost me as much to be cured of what I contracted from a whore, and that ten guineas was but a moderate expense for women during the winter.\u201d After a month of gifts and visits, he finally managed to get her alone and confess his love to her, pulling her dress and petticoats close to him and felt her face close to his.\u201cJamie,\u201d as she had so often called him tenderly \u201cwhat happens if I get pregnant?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not to worry my dear Miss Lewis, I would be a gentleman and see that our child would be well taken care of and raised right.\u201dThis was the right thing to say. She leaned in to kiss him and he kissed her in return\u2026.but nothing. Nothing. Damn cock! She cooed at him and sat on his lap, telling him to take it easy and to not stress himself out. In retrospect, it is likely she had had great familiarity with men and knew that sometimes their engines (as he called it) did not work. But eventually, he felt his flagging energies revive and  'was just making a triumphal entry when we heard her landlady coming up.' They composed themselves, met two days later in a seedy tavern and 'Five times was I fairly lost in supreme rapture', for him an unsurpassed feat of which he was extremely proud. Six days later, however, Boswell felt 'a little heat in the members of my body sacred to Cupid', and by the next day it 'too, too plain was Signor Gonorrhoea' again. When taxed with this unpleasant fact, Louisa confessed that she had been very bad three years ago, but had felt no symptoms for ei!~hteen months, and had slept with no-one but Boswell for six. It seen1s rrtore than likely that she was telling the truth and was an unsuspecting carrier, but Boswell was naturally furious and broke off all relations. 'Thus ended my intrigue with the fair Louisa ... from which I expected at least a winter's safe copulation.And so he found himself in Edinburgh again. Drunk. He had been living like a monk for the past few months, on bread and water and feeling great pity for himself. His friends had come by to visit him, some even teasing him 'Who in the performance of a manly part would not wish to get claps?' asked his friend, the Judge Advocate of Scotland. But damn it, he was done. He was don\u2019t trying to be a good person and trying to find a clean woman to call his. The past few weeks had been a blitz of various women and prostitutes in various parks and side alleys. But in each of these encounters he had been trying something new\u2014a recent device imported from France, called a cundum. And \u2018for the first time I did engage in armour, which I found but a dull satisfaction.\u2019 Too dull. Indeed, the previous night he picked up 'a fresh agreeable young girl' and took her down a lane to 'a snug place'. 'I took out my armour, but she begged that I might not put it on, as the sport was much pleasanter without it.' He had been a fool to agree to it, but there had been no serious consequences. \u201cHey mister, what are you doing here tonight?\u201d interrupted his thoughts. There were two young women, perhaps early 20s in front of him. He waved them away\u201cI don\u2019t have coin to spend on the likes of you. If you want to spend time with me, all I offer is my wine and my company.\u201dThey looked at each other and smiled. This was enough for them. They sat down with him. That\u2019s where the details get hazy, he confessed to his diary. One was named Gabrielle, and the other, he could not remember. Somehow, they ended back up in a tavern room somewhere, rolling around in bed together. -------------------------------------------------------*Boswell\u2019s London Journal*, PP\u2022 49, 83-4, 89,94-5,97, 17, 139-79, 149, 155, 161. 68. 8, 227., 231,241,262-4, 272-3, 280Lawrence Stone *The Family, Sex and Marriage In England 1500-1800* p. 570-80", "label": 0}, {"content": "I wake up in a dark room with a savage looking man.

Sometimes, the events held were *sylvae,* which was a sort of large-scale terrarium piece in which artists, designers, botanists, etc., recreated a forest, desert, etc., scene for the Roman public to experience. Sometimes animals would be let loose in here, and people could just come and watch and observe. Technically, the Colosseum was open to any Roman citizen. During gladiatorial combat, however, you must remember that the audience was often overwhelmingly male, and quite aggressive. You'd think of some of the world's worst soccer hooligans, for example. It's likely, although I have no direct evidence to support this, that young men were attracted, as they often are, to scenes like this. It's also likely that they were prevented from going at a very young age by the simple fact that there was nowhere to sit. Thinking on it a bit: we do know from Livy (and others) that the Vestal Virgins often attended ludi at the Colosseum. These were girls as young as six years old, so it is possible that, at least as far as this specific example goes, young children did attend the events. The Vestals were nearly always accompanied by bodyguards (usually lictors), however, and they sat in a box apart from the rest of the crowd, so it's unclear how representative they are. Cassius Dio mentions that Nero had children actually fight in gladiatorial combat in the Colosseum in order to impress the King of Armenia, so that's another example, albeit not one of spectatorship. Check out [Weidemann](_URL_0_) for more info. That's the only scant stuff I can come up with, I'm afraid, but I will get in touch with an old Classics prof of mine and try to get more info for you. Very interesting question.One thing to keep in mind, by the way, is that our definition of \"youth\" today is probably very different from what it was in the Roman era. Boys as young as 10 joined the Roman army and navy in a variety of roles. 35 years old was middle aged. So it may be that we would have seen some young faces in the crowds at the Colosseum that would make us balk today, but that wouldn't have caused an eye to bat back then.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Colosseum was a large amphitheater in Rome, Italy.

The difficulties with identifying modern victims of suicide come into play--people who try to cover up their own actions, families who don't report it. For the early modern era, the usual problem with surviving sources compounds these problems exponentially. But it's also harder because of much darker cultural beliefs about suicide. It was a matter of deep social shame for the survivors and the memory of the victim. It was a legal crime that punished survivors through state seizure of the victim's property. And in Christianity, it was a sin that sent one's soul straight to hell.This was true on all sides of the Reformation. In Catholicism, suicide offered no time for repentance between act and death. According to Protestant beliefs, suicide was an act of the reprobate. So with so much societal push against suicide, combined with the usual narratives of the early modern era as the \"rise of social discipline,\" who would get to the point of actively trying to kill themselves? Through the difficulties in the sources, one thing has stood out in multiple studies. Suicide was often, though obviously not always, a sin and a crime of social and economic outcasts. People who perceived they had nowhere to turn or would have nowhere to turn in the future; people who faced a really awful future.Legal records are where most of our data on suicide in early modern Europe comes from--actual court cases, records of deaths in a city, investigations of violent death and accidents in general. But studies of England and northern Germany show some of the problems with using these records straightforwardly. First, it's generally considered fact that people sought desperately to cover up the suicidal death of a family member for three reasons: their own social shame, refusal of Christian burial rites, and seizure of property. In England, laws mandating almoners and coroners investigate *all* suspicious deaths were codified around 1500, which you would think would eliminate some of the chances of a cover-up. But as R. A. Houston showed for 16th century England, cases taken to the courts often ended up more as a mediation in how to divide a deceased person's assets than outright forfeiture. And they might not end up in court until *decades* after a death. At the same time, there's plenty of evidence of families indeed trying to cover up someone's suicide. And people who committed suicide themselves might also have taken care. So we're definitely still dealing with very selective reporting and recording.In northern Germany and Scandinavia, so-called \"suicidal murder\" became a major problem in the 16th-18th centuries. This involved a person who despaired to the point of suicide actually murdering someone else, a victim and in a manner that made capital punishment inevitable (usually a child not related to them). Arne Jansson traced this horror to a local folk belief that a violent death of any kind--including execution--sent one to heaven. This would presumably constitute a small number of cases of suicide overall. But it's a useful, if tragic, reminder that suicide doesn't always look like \"suicide.\"And of course, a major difficulty is that sources don't always agree--and that they disagree in really significant ways. Through 1646, Laura Cruz observed 38 suicides recorded in court records for Leiden; Jeffrey Watts observed 41 in Geneva through 1650. This seems quite ordinary until you realize that Leiden was about twice the size of Geneva.However, Cruz and Watts found agreement in their sources on a crucial point: suicide was overwhelmingly an act of the socially marginalized. Cruz observes a strong link between economic difficulties and suicide. Even as Leiden prospered dramatically, not everyone came along. Those excluded from guild membership as temporary workers (the adjunct professors of early modern trades, if you will) or those still trying to earn their way in as apprentices (the grad students) constituted 20% of the people \"convicted\" of committing suicide in court records. Feeling a full sense of belonging and community in a church was also insulation from actually committing suicide, although there is no information on attempts. Cruz found only 2 cases out of 38 who were full members of a Calvinist or Anabaptist church (about 40% of the population overall).For Geneva, on the other hand, Watt identified surprisingly specific groups as those most likely to commit suicide: suspected witches, prisoners, and people previously considered violently insane. 9 out of the 41 pre-1650 victims of suicide had been accused or suspected of witchcraft.Studying England, Houston cautions that the predominance of social outcasts in statistics about people who committed suicide, likely reflects source bias to some extent. MacDonald and Murphy in *Sleepless Souls: Suicide in Early Modern England* highlight the presence of nobles and wealthier burghers among the registers of suicide victims. But they still point out that based on assets uncovered for forfeiture, more than half of victims of suicide would qualify as poor or destitute. Sharon Strocchia, meanwhile, studied suicides and suicide attempts among nuns in early modern Italy--what more tight-knit community than a convent? It's impossible to reconstruct the complex social, medical, and personal reasons that any one person committed suicide. But looking at the circumstances of these nuns, she detected two patterns at work in many (not all) cases. First, some of the nuns were noted as suffering horrible verbal and even physical abuse. (And this does not seem to have been an exaggeration--one nun, who reported the suicide of her sister to local authorities, also sought permission to transfer to another convent because of the terrible environment.) Second, many nuns who attempted suicide, or had sisters desperately concerned that they would, were among those forced into monastic life by relatives. In both those cases, there was sharp displacement from these women's desired community, whether that was within the convent or outside.And Houston offers a poignant reminder that \"social outcast\" could come in many forms. From 17th century Shropshire (the year isn't clear), a man named John Gossage committed suicide by taking arsenic. He had spent time in jail for counterfeiting money and was accounted an alcoholic by survivors. When his body was found, the only person the town could find to deal with his burial was his landlord.And the nameless woman who threw herself into the Nor Loch in Edinburgh in 1665? She was buried right next to where she drowned herself--she had no family or friends to claim, move, or take care of her body.

A monarch was naturally expected to entertain lavishly as befitting his station by divine right and, although we are familiar with excesses of certain royals, activities such as state feasts and competitions were a way for the monarch to demonstrate the health and wealth of his nation. This is an enormously broad generalization of nearly a thousand years of pre-modern era entertaining, but the point is that feasts and tourneys were not just a sign of largesse, but also a projection of power.In England, the Sovereign expected a certain level of entertainment when visiting their vassals. This was a double edged sword. While the Sovereign's visit was generally perceived as a nominal sign of favor, it also provided an opportunity for the monarch to examine and question his vassal about his wealth and political motives. Since the Sovereign could not be denied, it was also an opportunity to enact a sort of tax on the vassal: these visits could be ruinously expensive as the vassal in question would not only entertain the King, but his sometimes vast retinue as well. The tradition of non-refusal is still nominally alive today.

Let's go country by country; we'll mostly bracket the Caribbean and then deal Spanish colonies last. The United States came out of British colonial North America.  This united more or less all the English speaking British colonies on the North American continent that had been under British rule before 1763.  Though all original thirteen colonies were on the Atlantic, the country eventually extended down to the part of of the Gulf of Mexico and also all the way across to the Pacific.  Alaska was purchased from the Russians shortly after the Civil War.What's now Canada were all British colonies after 1763, but before that it was French.  Quebec's separate history and legal status, and particularly the French language, civil law, and Catholicism, led it to decline to join the United States to the south.  The very simplified version is that, under British rule, gradually, English speaking upper Canada (roughly Ontario) became as important as French speaking lower Canada (roughly Quebec), and the two were combined into a dominion along with outlying smaller colonies (New Brunswick and Nova Scotia).  The Dominion, like its southern neighbor, gradually extended its frontier all the way to the Pacific.  There's also Belize, which was a British colony in Central America; Saint Pierre and Miquelon, which is still French territory; and the Caribbean island, which on the bigger island was basically one country per colonizer per island, and though some of the areas with several small islands combined (Bahamas, Trinidad and Tobago), I believe always in accordance with pre\u2010independence administrative boundaries. Obviously, there are several places Caribbean islands and island chains that are not independent (Puerto Rico, the British Virgin Islands, Martinque, Guadeloupe, etc.)In South America, the main non\u2010Spanish colonizer was Portugal, whose territories remained undivided and form what is now Brazil.  It did, however, expand slightly at the expense of some of the Pacific Spanish countries.There are those triplets on the north coast, the Guianas: the former British colony of Guyana, the former Dutch colony of Suriname, and the current French overseas department of French Guiana.  All three colonial powers began settlement in the seventeenth century and then just sort of stayed that way, though the British didn't directly control much land until the Dutch ceded them half the land in 1814.  I don't think borders changed after that.  I don't know very much about them.  There were brief attempts at dinky colonies in continental North America (Sweden, the Netherlands, Scotland, Russia at least), but none of them lasted centuries so none of them left a trace on our maps.So, now we get to the question, why does it seem like the Spanish countries divided differently in North and South America?  They didn't, really.  So, quick Spanish colonial history, all the continental Spanish speaking countries got their independence in a very short window, between 1810 and 1830.  What happened?  The shortest story is, Napoleon conquers Spain, this creates this huge legitimacy crisis in the colonies, and they start declaring independence.  There's decades of war not just between the Spanish and the American\u2010born creoles, but also between Royalists and pro\u2010independence forces.  In the end, the Spanish and the Royalists lose everywhere.How did Spanish America get its borders, though?  To understand that, we need to understand a little about the administrative structure of Bourbon Spanish America.  At the highest level of organization, there were four viceroys: New Spain, mostly modern Mexico, the Western U.S., and Central America; New Granada, mostly modern Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela; Peru, mostly modern Peru; and Rio de la Plata, mostly modern Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay.  These were basically separate colonies, and could not trade with each other.  All trade, in theory at least, had to go through Spain, e.g. Peru and New Spain could not trade with each other.  It is not surprising that they would all break into separate countries, as they by design had limited connections with each other.  Below the Viceroy, was the Captaincy General.  These were military governors nominally connected to viceroys, but in practice separate from them, having totally separate bureaucracies.  Chile, Guatemala (all the modern Spanish speaking Central American countries), and Venezuela were all separate captaincy generals, and so it makes sense that these, too became independent.  There were two others, the Yucatan and one in northern Mexico, but Mexico basically conquered and incorporated these in the first years of independence, as it tried and failed to do with the Captaincy General of Guatemala.  Guatemala, due to particularly strong local politics, broke apart into separate countries at the lowest level of colonial administration (the tax district, called an [*intendencia*](_URL_0_)).Now, basically, that leaves us with only two questions: why did Rio de la Plata and New Granada split up differently?  In the end, these countries split up at the [*audiencia*](_URL_2_) level.  Audiencias were technically just royal appellate courts districts (notice it's a cognate with audience), but they fulfilled a variety of government functions, and I have seen them described as de facto parliaments.  While the densely settled and densely administered Peru and New Spain split at the Viceroy level, the more thinly settled New Granada and Rio de la Plata split at the audiencia level.  In New Granada, the separate audiencias in Bogota and Quito formed the core of Colombia and Ecuador, with the Captaincy General in Caracas becoming Venezuala.  Rio de la Plata is more complicated, with the bulk of the Viceroy becoming Argentina.  Uruguay's independence story is complex, but it was split off as a sort of buffer state between two powerful neighbors, think a South American Belgium, under a strong British influence.  Bolivia was the part of Rio de la Plata that was under the administration of the audiencia of Charcas (present day Sucre).  Paraguay is *weird*, like I think Paraguay's history is the weirdest history I've ever read.  Its colonial history starts out as just Jesuits and indigenous people, no colonist, and the Jesuits try to build a strange utopia, until they are suppressed by the Church worldwide due to unrelated politics, at which point Paraguay reverts back to a normal colonial administration.  It was an independent intendencia during the Wars of Independence, and I believe most people were set to become part of the United Colonies of Rio de la Plata (Argentina), until one guy, Jos\u00e9 Gaspar Rodr\u00edguez de Francia led the charge to become fully independent.  Fascinating dude, he, like the Jesuits, tried to run Paraguay as isolated utopia, though more under the influence of Rousseau than Francis Xavier.  Within South America, several wars shifted the borders, but the cores remained the same as independence, which meant that the cores were largely based on pre\u2010independence divisions.  But the basic, tl;dr is that post\u2010independence borders followed colonial administrative borders.  For the non\u2010Spanish countries, post\u2010colonial administration was heavily influenced by pre\u2010colonial administration, meaning that this basically all the land a European power had in the region  (except in the Caribbean, where it broke up more by island and noting that in terms of sovereignty, Quebec was British at American independence, but administratively it was still rather French).  For the continental Spanish colonies, they broke up along Viceroy/Captaincy General lines, except in the two sparsely administered Viceroys, which broke up along the lower, audiencia levels, with Paraguay and Central America being exceptions cases.  In North America, the minor powers were expelled from the continent, while in South America, they stayed in Guianas.  So while some of the weird things that happened were contingent, like the U.S. being able to buy Russia out, for the most part post\u2010colonial administration was closely linked to colonial administration.  If there's one big difference, it's that South America only really had a tiny frontier (Patagonia, with maybe the Amazon being an unofficial frontier\u2010\u2010that's certainly how Brazil treated it), while the amount of unclaimed/undeveloped/unadministered land in North America was huge.  If the current U.S. and Canada had all been colonized before independence, or if Spanish independence happened after the development of administrative/communications technologies like the train, the telegraph, and steamship, *and* because of that, either had been organized as a colonial realm differently, there might have been a different count of countries in the two continents.*edit*: Clarified some language. Also, I forgot add that Panama was part of Colombia, not part of the intendencia of Guatemala.  While there were several movements to secede before this, independence only happened in 1903... when the U.S. wanted to build a canal and the Colombian senate declined to ratify the [Hay\u2013Herr\u00e1n Treaty](_URL_1_).

In fact, Vichy France until the end of its existance claimed its capital to be in Paris but to only have the seat of government temporarily moved to Vichy. Why? Well, the north was of course occupied by the Germans. Why was that? Because the Germans needed the north for their war against the UK. Also, the north contained natural resources and industrial areas that the Germans repurposed for the war effort. These territorial acquisitions were not permanent. Even Alsace-Lorraine, the ever painful point of contention between Germany and France, was not annexed by Nazi Germany during the war, instead being transferred into two CdZ areas, which was a kind of assimilated semi-military occupation. Germany established similar political constructions in Luxembourg and Slovenia.Germany at that point hoped to make a western peace - aware of its likely inability to militarily force British defeat, the Germans wanted to keep the door open to a peace negotiation with the western Allies on the condition that Germany be allowed to do with its eastern livingspace whatever it desired. That of course did not happen.So what if? Had Germany won WW2, what would have happened with France? Well, this is a bit of an AltHistory construction obviously, but I am firmly convinced that the *Heim ins Reich* rhetoric of the German leadership would not have allowed them to not annex Alsace-Lorraine. Furthermore, during the war there had been forced deportations of non-German inhabitants from Alsace-Lorraine to the remaining French occupation zone.Apart from that, you will often hear about Himmler's dream to create an \"SS-Ordensstaat Burgund\" in Burgundy that might have reached from the North Sea to somewhere down in Switzerland. Indeed, these considerations existed and played a role in for example the resettlement of German-language South Tyrolean farmers from Italy into Germany in the early 1940s. Apart from Alsace-Lorraine and Burgundy though, we have no reason to believe that the rest of northern France would have not been given back to a Nazi-friendly French administration like Petain's in Vichy.You said it yourself: \"Armistice\" - that's what the French government signed, not a \"Peace Treaty\". That's a very important distinction, as any student of Korean history will know.That said, enough of France's role under the German yoke.Petain himself was already before the war notoriously anti-parliamentarian if not authoritarian and personally friendly to fascistic movements like Franco's Spain as well as in diplomatic ideology anti-British, as exemplified in his participation of the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Yorktown in October of 1931.When called to action by Prime Minister Reynaud on 18 May 1940 as Minister for War and Deputy PM, Petain could do little to stop the German advance - not only was the man over 80 and had his military prime two decades behind him, France's military situation would have been unwinnable even in the most skillful hands. The Allied forces were cut up in various pockets like Belgium, Arras, Dunkirk; and the realization of French military insufficiency to deal with German strategic and technological innovation came too late.Reynaud, who wanted to continue the war, suddenly found himself politically isolated at Petain's charge against him: Petain wanted to capitulate and to quickly make peace with the invader. That such a renowned war hero like himself deemed the war unwinnable was very impressive on the French popular conscious in 1940 and set the seeds for three decades of national humilations at various frontlines in the world - the Westfeldzug, Indochina, the Suez and Algeria as the most prominent among them.That said, it is not clear ***why*** Petain did this. He certainly justified it with patriotic rationalism - it's the best thing for France to accept the inevitable. Whether or not he had vicious intent to form the antisemitic totalitarian puppet state that Vichy France would end up being cannot be shown or disproven for sure - but he certainly made himself guilty the moment he did not resign after surrendering to the Germans. That moment when he decided to be Hitler's puppet was the moment when he cast his own historical legacy into oblivion.So it goes, sometimes.", "label": 0}, {"content": "In WWI Petain sacrificed 140 000 men to gain a few hundred meters in the Battle of the Somme.

Though, of course, there are historians whose take on Harding diverges from this consensus. There are a variety of reasons why Harding's reputation is so poor - namely, the perception that he was something of a puppet, the personal scandals associated with Harding that emerged after his death, the political scandal of the Teapot Dome being the first time a Cabinet member had gone to prison, and Harding not really having signature policy achievements beyond a somewhat nebulous 'return to normalcy'.Firstly, the perception of Harding for a long time, until the 1960s, was that he was a small-town newspaperman plucked from obscurity by men in the archetypal smoke-filled room for his good looks, his genial manner, and his basic lack of interest in actually running the country. His public perception was perhaps similar to the public perception of George W. Bush in the 2000s, when people assumed he was something of a puppet of Dick Cheney without much depth. The Harding family kept the Hardings' letters and correspondence private until the 1960s, which meant that this was the dominant perception of Harding for close to half a century (the private papers made it clearer that Harding had a lot more influence on policy direction than had previously been thought, and that he was more articulate on policy matters in private).Secondly, a number of lurid details were published about Harding relatively soon after his death in 1923, which further fixed public views about him for some time. Firstly, in 1927, Nan Britton released a book called *The President's Daughter* in which she claimed that her illegitimate daughter's father was in fact Harding. In a more socially conservative age, this claim did a lot of damage to Harding's reputation amongst conservatives, though its veracity [was in dispute until 2015](_URL_0_), when DNA testing showed that it was true. Secondly, a 1930 book by Gaston Means, who had worked at the Bureau of Investigation (but who Coffey calls a 'charlatan' and 'swindler') claimed not only that this was true but that Means had even confirmed this to Florence Harding (Harding's wife), who had promptly poisoned her husband. Florence had died in 1924, and was not around to deny such things, and the Harding family keeping their papers private until the 1960s meant that they could not shed light on these rumours one way or the other.Thirdly, a lot of the public was inclined to believe such claims because of the Teapot Dome scandal, which painted Harding in a poor light - his Secretary of the Interior Albert Bacon Fall was the first ever Cabinet member to go to prison, for his part in taking bribes to lease government-controlled oil reserves to oilmen (including at Teapot Dome in Wyoming, thus the name of the scandal) at low rates. Even a basically positive biography of Harding like 1969's *The Harding Era* by Robert K. Murray finds that there were several character flaws of Harding's which directly led to the Teapot Dome scandal (Murray pushes hard against the small-town newspaperman plucked to power by the smoke-filled room thing, but even he ultimately sees Harding as unfit for the Presidency, temperament-wise).As to Harding's policies, the defining 'brand' of Harding's presidency was the 'return to normalcy'. Phillip G. Payne claims that > it was not the case that Harding was a polarizing figure while president whose policies were vigorously debated, indeed it was just the opposite: there are few policy debates from the Hardingyears. It's difficult to put modern political labels of progressive and conservative on the political parties of the time, but there were certainly progressive movements in the early 20th century, and Harding was decidedly in contrast to the progressive, statist values of Woodrow Wilson that, by 1920, were seen poorly by the public. Harding's big brand was the 'return to normalcy', and his stance was a sort of return to the 'small government' values of the Gilded Age. These kinds of policies continued throughout the 1920s and early 1930s under Coolidge and Hoover, and they seemed to be unable to deal with the Great Depression, especially once Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Keynesian New Deal policies became the basis of essentially bipartisan policy until Reagan. Insofar as Harding's policies were perceived as playing a role in leading to the Great Depression, perhaps unsurprisingly they were received poorly by historians, especially left-leaning ones. And insofar as there were few policy debates from the relatively-shortlived Harding years, and so there was little in the way of big ideas and strong stances for historians to discuss, Harding's lack of policy prowess means that there aren't a huge amount of strong defenders of his legacy. It's perhaps indicative that the most positive portrayal of Harding comes from a 2004 biography by John Dean, who, well, also happens to be a person went to prison for his role in Watergate.Sources:* 'Progressivism in an Age of Normalcy: Women\u2019s Rights, Civil Service, Veterans\u2019 Benefits, and Child Welfare' by John F.

Before this period, the fur trade was principally a matter of *trade.* Men like Manuel Lisa, Pierre Chouteau Jr. and Wilson Price Hunt ran business concerns that traded with Native groups that did the hard work of trapping, cleaning and collecting furs. Americans, French, British and Spanish in what is now the American West were only visitors to the region. They brought in trade goods, bartered with their furs, and left with them.There were problems with this approach, of course. If something went wrong, an isolated trader or trading group could be attacked or simply run into bad weather. The rivers of the West, particularly the Missouri, were the highways of their day, even before steamboats were popularized. People who didn't get their cut of the trade were willing to block traders or attack them. Simply delaying traders could be deadly or time-consuming. Winter meant the freezing of the rivers and the end of easy travel. Some traders would simply cache their furs in a secure location, then return for them once the rivers thawed. Others would settle down for a long winter. In either case, the result was less than optimal for the Eastern businessmen backing these trading adventures.Enter William Ashley. Co-founder (with Andrew Henry) of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, he hit upon the innovation of a fur *trapping* operation where white Americans would stay in the fur-bearing areas for years, collecting the furs themselves and keeping them secure. Every summer, the trappers would meet at a designated, comparatively close, location to meet the eastbound fur trader, then repeat the process.As Richard White put it in *It's Your Misfortune and None of My Own,* his 1991 history of the American West: > \"These mountain men of the central Rockies were part of a major innovation in the fur trade engineered by William Ashley. Driven off the Missouri by Arikara attacks, and unable to get Indians in the central plains to trap on the scale he desired, Ashley persuaded his white trappers to stay permanently in the mountains. He sent a supply train to annual rendezvous, where trappers and Indians exchanged furs for supplies and engaged in an extended bacchanal. ... The lucky ones lived, but they often ended up, in the words of Nathaniel Wyeth, who organized an unsuccessful fur company, \"mere slaves to catch beavers for others.\" The real profits went to the large companies who organized production or brought goods west. These companies would maintain the so-called Rocky Mountain trapping system, in one form or another, until 1840.\"The Rocky Mountain Fur Company held effective dominion over the central and northern Rockies, while American trappers based in Taos, New Mexico, obliterated beaver populations across the southern Rockies. Men like Etienne Provost and others began working out of Taos starting in 1823, the same year that *The Revenant* is set. The Rocky Mountain trapping system was a grave threat to the Rockies' native inhabitants. The white trappers had no qualms about harvesting fur-bearing animals far above sustainable levels, and their mere existence meant Native trappers were facing competition. The Arikara and others acted militarily, but the United States was able to respond militarily in a way that the Spanish and British empires never had before.When Ashley's fur-trapping parties were attacked on the Missouri River in April 1823 (this is about the time of *The Revenant*), he summons the aid of the 6th U.S. Infantry. In a punitive expedition during the summer of 1823, Leavenworth leads an expedition of more than 1,000 men (of which 700 are Sioux) against the Arikara. By mid-August, that expedition forced the Arikara out of their villages along the Missouri and reopened the river to fur travel. It's unknown how many Arikara died in the following winter from exposure or starvation. I share all of this with you by way of explanation. The Arikara in particular were no strangers to Western contact. By 1823, they would have seen a growing number of white traders ascending the Missouri River, and many of those whites angered them by disregarding their territorial ownership of that particular stretch of the river. The Arikara would have seen men ascending and descending the river, been familiar with their cargos and their missions, and by virtue of their own ability to use that river, traveling to St. Louis, Memphis or New Orleans would have given them insight into the world beyond.If you're interested in more stories about this period, you might consider trying to find the epic collection *Mountain Men and the Fur Trade of the Far West*, edited by LeRoy Hafen.

When cities and nobles in the Low Countries went to war amongst themselves in the 15th and 16th centuries, for example, it was not uncommon to hire one person or a small group to stake out a particular location for a few days and watch for enemy soldier moving through there. In 1511, for example, a small posse of spies from Haarlem avoided detection on the roads by taking a sled across frozen Lake Haarlem to a watch point on the border with Utrecht. This was a one-time payment. During the Hundred Years' War, too, the English government would hire fishermen to watch for French sea movement.However, city records also reflect the existence of so-called \"secret friends\"--longer-term relationships with a lookout, or perhaps a bureaucrat in another city. That is, they reflect *payments to* these \"secret friends.\" Unfortunately, we don't hear much about how they started spying or what happened to them afterwards--only the occasional tantalizing hint like the payment rendered to the *widow* of Hendrik Faes (also in 1511).As far as more widespread networks go, though, the two most flexible and popular ways to obtain information were through ambassadors and messengers. Ambassadors made great spies first of all because of their freedom to travel, and second because by the very nature of their position they had access to people of at least some power. It's important to remember that in the days before news in the modern sense (a MASSIVE rumor mill, to be sure, but not journalism like today), \"espionage\" could mean gathering information simply about *what had happened*. The example I love is the English accusing Scotland of spying simply for knowing that the 1381 Peasants' Revolt had happened. (...)Messengers also had freedom to travel without suspicion and were a readily organized group. One aspect of their utility came in their carrying of *letters*. They could convey the information written down, but also, they were the ones who knew the *oral* component of messages--medieval letters were often mostly placeholders for the real message. But also, due to the freedom of movement, they might be instructed to peek into dark corners and bring back observations of what they saw. In general, wartime courier-spies were those who had the job during peacetime; they were approached and paid more when fighting threatened.It wasn't unusual in medieval Europe for people to carry out long-distance, long-term friendships entirely by letter and messenger--never actually meeting in person. It stands to reason that long-distance spies would be recruited the same way--have a trusted messenger (ambassador, courier, merchant) and make sure they had ample money to buy some new loyalty.Oh, yes--a not uncommon note in sources is recompense for a courier-spy who had been robbed along the way.ETA: I offer some sources on espionage in the medieval world in [this earlier thread](_URL_0_).", "label": 0}, {"content": "In medieval Europe, spies were common.

Indeed, as Polybius points out of the feathers on the *hastati* in the mid 2nd Century BC: > \"Finally they wear as an ornament a circle of feathers with three upright purple or black feathers about a cubit in height, the addition of which on the head surmounting their other arms is to make every man look twice his real height, and to give him a fine appearance, such as will strike terror into the enemy. \" (Pol 6.23).A cubit is 1.5 feet, so you can see how having these feathers on your helmet would make you taller, more colourful, more impressive, more intimidating. Such intimidation factor was essential in ancient battles where presenting an imposing spectacle to the enemy was an essential element of breaking their combat motivation and winning the fight. The emphasis the Romans (as others no doubt did also) placed on preparing their equipment to by shiny and impressive is evidenced in several accounts, one being the following, wherein the soldiers of Lucius Aemilius Paulus prepare to fight Perseus, King of Macedon, in 168 BC: > \"...some were sharpening swords, others were polishing helmets and cheek-pieces, still others shields and coats of mail; some were fitting their armour to their bodies and trying the nimbleness of their bodies under arms, others were brandishing spears, other fencing with their swords and inspecting the point...\" (Livy 44.34).As you can see, not only do they sometimes wear elaborate headpieces, they go to a lot of effort to make sure their armour is well-polished, to make it brighter and more impressive. The effect of impressively-attired individuals is magnified when an entire army is dressed in such a manner. The impression a well-outfitted army can have is described by Livy, of Hannibal's veterans at Cannae in 216 BC: > \"The shields of the Gauls and Spaniards were nearly of the same make; their swords were different, both in length and form; those of the Gauls being very long, and without points, those of the Spaniards, whose practice was rather to thrust at their enemy, than to strike, light and handy, and sharp at the point. The troops of these nations made a more terrible appearance than any of the rest, on account of the size of their bodies, and also of their figure. The Gauls were naked from their middle upward; the Spaniards clad in linen vests, of a surprising and dazzling whiteness, and bordered with purple. \" (Livy 22.46).Another example of the importance of appearances is Livy's description of a particularly well-dressed Samnite army that Lucius Papirius Cursor faced c. 309 BC: > \"This body, from the covering of the enclosure wherein the nobility had been thus devoted, was called the linen legion. They were furnished with splendid armour, and plumed helmets, to distinguish them above the rest. They had another body of forces, amounting to somewhat more than twenty thousand, not inferior to the linen legion, either in personal appearance, or renown in war, or their equipment for service.\" (Livy 9.38).There are numerous other accounts of armies being described as impressive and intimidating because their armour was well-polished, their clothes were colourful, their soldiers were large, etc. As such, the feathers/brushes that Romans wore on their helmets served this same purpose, of making soldiers more impressive and intimidating the enemy. Such helmet decorations are peculiar not only to the Romans of course, and almost every ancient army tended to make a habit of putting something on their helmets or designing them in such a way as to make the soldier appear taller and more impressive. That it worked and continues to work is evident by the fact that soldiers continued to wear impressive but otherwise awkward helmets even in the modern day: observe the impressive headgear of, for instance, [English dragoons](_URL_0_) or [Napoleon's Imperial Guard](_URL_2_). But going back to the ancient world, you can see similar practices by the [Macedonians](_URL_5_), the [Gauls](_URL_3_) and pretty much everybody else to some extent. As some others may point out, different helmet set-ups and plume-types could also signify rank and make the wearer more noticeable for the purposes of leadership, as is prominently the case with Roman [centurions](_URL_1_) or [tribunes/legates and standard-bearers](_URL_6_) (Caesar would also have had an elaborate Hellenistic-style helmet in battle). But for the majority of soldiers, the plumes were there primarily to make them look taller and more impressive in order to intimidate their enemies. That is not to say they were always worn of course: legionaries in the Late-Republic and Imperial period wore other designs such as the [Montefortino](_URL_7_) or [Imperial-Gallic](_URL_4_) helmet that are often depicted without crests, but it should be noted that attachments existed on most helmets to which plumes and crests could be attached (Bishop  &  Coulston, 102-3). Considering the psychological role of crests and tall helmets, I'm not sure why Roman soldiers seemed to have stopped wearing them as much, but I wouldn't be surprised if it had a bit to do with practicality in the field: in other regards developments in Roman helmets into the Imperial period such as increased neck and shoulder protection, the introduction of a browguard to defend against downward slashing attacks, and better ear and cheek-pieces seem to follow this pattern (101-2). However, somebody who knows more about equipment in particular could no doubt easily teach me a thing or two about why this occurred.**EDIT:** It occurred to me after writing this post that the OP may have been mainly referring to the stereotypical depiction of Roman legionaries as wearing red crests, even in battle, in various visual media. For a start, red was not a colour as closely associated with the Romans as Hollywood has led us to assume, with soldiers wearing various coloured tunics, white perhaps being common, or blue/green for marines in the Later Empire, while the military cloak (shown always as red in shows such as Spartacus) also being of various colours, though generals often did wear red ones (Southern 154-5). As I said above, we know Roman helmets even in the Empire often had attachments for plumes or crests. But we flat out do not know if they wore them in battle, and we cannot too heavily on the idealised sculptural evidence (the detail we have lost without the paint notwithstanding) such as Trajan's Column (152-3) . Southern seems to summarise the matter (regarding soldiers in the Imperial period that is, we know in the Early to Mid Republic soldiers often fought with helmet plumes and feathers) in an eminently sensible manner: > \"It is not certain whether the Romans went into battle wearing their crests and plumes. On Trajan's Column it seems that these were fitted only for parades and ceremonies, but Julius Caesar describes an occasion when fighting broke out unexpectedly, giving the soldiers no time to take off their shield covers, or to fit their plumes to their helmets. It may have been a case of fashionable practice at certain times, or perhaps it was left to the discretion of the general in command.\" (158)For those interested, Southern is referring to this excerpt from Caesar's commentaries: > \"Caesar gave the necessary commands, and then ran down in a chance direction to harangue the troops, and came to the Tenth Legion. His harangue to the troops was no more than a charge to bear in mind their ancient valour, to be free from alarm, and bravely to withstand the onslaught of the enemy; then, as the enemy were no farther off than the range of a missile, he gave the signal to engage. He started off among other things in the other direction to give like harangue, and found them fighting. The time was so short, the temper of the enemy so ready for conflict, that there was no space not only to fit badges in their places, but even to put on helmets and draw covers from shields. In whichever direction each man chanced to come in from the entrenching, whatever standard each first caught sight of, by that he stood, to lose no fighting time in seeking out his proper company.\" (Caesar BG 2.21)To make it really complicated though, the word \"badges\" (or \"emblems\" in the Penguin translation) is a translation of, in this instance, the Latin *insignia*, which generally refers to a mark, a token, a signal, a proof, etc. It's not certain that *insignia* actually refers to, it's just an assumption that it's referring to helmet crests, but it could possibly refer to some other item that distinguished men or units.So basically we don't know if legionaries wore those horse-hair plumes you see in movies a lot during battle, but we do know they wore plumes and similar things in the Mid-Republic, we know that their helmets could  have crests or plumes attached to them even in later periods, and we know that crests, feathers, plumes and similar features of helmets were intended to make the soldier, in the context of battle, look taller, more impressive, and more intimidating.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Romans used a brush on their helmets to remove sand and dust from their faces.

Now the prisoners were often used for dangerous work. For example, in October of 1940 Himmler ordered prisoners to be used to help deal with unexploded bombs, the prisoners were promised a reduction in their sentence for their work although, most were never given the reduction. The death rate of these prisoners was around 50 percent, also as the war went on overcrowding became an issue the Nazis began to execute prisoners, in one night in 1943 they executed over 194 prisoners in a Berlin jail. The reason for the increase was due to new draconian wartime laws that prohibited association with POWs and other laws that made imprisonment hard to avoid. Women also suffered and began to be convicted in higher numbers. 46,500 women were convicted in 1939 alone. This harshness was not just for rapists and murderers, Hitler felt that there were too many thieves and burglars and that the German justice system was too lenient on them. He felt that they should be sent to concentration camps and that putting them in prison made them a burden on society. Clearly the third Reich was not fond of criminals of any stripe. As the years went on more and more Germans were being sentenced to death (there was a slight drop, this is due to the SS taking over many of the executions and thus records area little misleading) and those who weren't were being sentenced to hard labor which was really still a death sentence. There were also penal battalions, but those were more for prisoners who had committed crimes in the army. So back to the original question, Nazi Germany treated its normal criminals like we do, with prison, but the harshness of the Nazis meant that they were subjected to extremely awful conditions.

Outright destruction of houses was comparatively rare, though, in the first six weeks of attacks around 16,000 houses were destroyed, 60,000 seriously damaged but repairable, and 130,000 slightly damaged. Unexploded bombs also forced many houses to be evacuated, with over 3,000 UXBs by the end of November 1940 awaiting disposal. Local authorities were not prepared for the scale of the problem, in part due to pre-war estimates of casualties from bombing raids being far higher than actually transpired. Rest centres had been established for bombing victims, typically in schools, but these were envisaged as a very short term measure, for a matter of hours rather than days, before people made their own arrangements for accommodation. In most cases this was possible; wealthier people could rent a flat in London or a cottage in the home counties, others arranged to stay with family or friends. Some took to 'Trekking', leaving the city entirely at night for camps outside in places such as Epping Forest, or were evacuated to other parts of the country. For some (around one in seven) the rest centres became longer term accommodation; up to 25,000 people were staying in them during the first months. Conditions were extremely poor at first, most rest centres having minimal sanitation facilities and insufficient bedding, but were rapidly improved by both government action and individual volunteers (*Problems of Social Policy* by Richard M. Titmuss includes the account of a \"Mrs B\", a beetroot seller who took charge of an Islington rest centre to organise the feeding of babies, washing, sweeping, breakfast etc.) Responsibility for assisting the victims of bombing was disjointed, with 96 different authorities concerned with billeting and housing in the London region. Some exhibited posters after attacks with information about the rest centres and other services, but the approach was piecemeal until late 1940, air raid victims could spend much time going from office to office trying to get assistance.On September 26th 1940 Henry Willink was appointed Special Regional Commissioner for the Homeless. Repair of damaged houses was a priority, as people strongly desired to return to their own homes, or at least neighbourhoods, if at all possible, and by January 1941 80% of the 500,000 damaged houses in London had been repaired, linoleum, cardboard, plasterboard and tarpaulin used for at least temporary repairs if necessary. Local authorities requisitioned empty houses (25,000 by late October 1940), though these still required furniture, bedding and utilities before people could be moved in, and Willink also appointed a permanent staff of social workers for as a Ministry of Health circular put it: \"Experience has shown that the rehousing of homeless people involves more than securing simply that there is accommodation in billets or in requisitioned homes for the number of persons involved. \"Case-work,\" taking into account the needs of the individual persons or families affected is also necessary and becomes more important the greater the distance between the original home and the new accommodation\". By the middle of 1941, then, the situation was greatly improved. More government administrative centres and information centres had been established, along with assistance from voluntary bodies such as the Women's Voluntary Service. Over the course of the London Blitz around 107,000 people were rehoused, 366,000 were billeted, and 181,000 mothers and children were officially evacuated.Sources:*Problems of Social Policy*, Richard M.

If you were to type out all the known, verifiable facts about William Shakespeare, the text would fill less than half of one page:He was born in 1564 (probably on April 23rd) and died in 1616 (definitely on April 23rd).  He was born in Stratford-Upon-Avon to a family of modest but not insignificant means.  His parents saw to his education as a child and he married Anne Hathaway (about whom we also know practically nothing) when he was 18 years old.  She was 26 and pregnant with his first child (Susanna) on their wedding day in 1582.  The twins, Hamnet and Judith, were born to the couple in 1585.*At some point* in the 1580s he moved to London to be an actor before trying his hand at playwriting.  His first plays appear on stage in 1589-91.  By 1591 his work had become popular enough to attract the admiration and jealousy of his contemporaries (playwright Robert Greene called him an \"upstart crow\").  By 1596 he had produced at least two genuine hits (*Richard III* and *Romeo and Juliet*) that would be remounted numerous times throughout his career and he had purchased a 12.5% interest in The Lord Chamberlain's Men, serving as both actor and in-house playwright.  In 1599 the Globe Theatre was completed and would serve as his primary artistic home for the remainder of his career.  In 1603 the Lord Chamberlain's Men became The King's Men when King James I ascended the throne and became the group's primary patron.  Shakespeare retired in 1613 or 1614 and moved back to Stratford where he occasionally collaborated with other playwrights until his death in 1616.His will left most of his wealth to his daughter, Susanna.  We have a few verified samples of his handwriting (mostly signatures) and he is mentioned in a few diaries and royal records for having performed in the private homes of wealthy families.That's more or less it.  We have no private correspondence, no personal diaries, and any mentions of him by his contemporaries either praise or deride his abilities as a playwright and actor, but never elaborate on his personality.Everything that follows this sentence is in the realm of academic and literary speculation, extrapolation, and educated guesses.*A Midsummer Night's Dream* is the only plot in Shakespeare that has no other literary precedent.  The play's depiction of young people having romantic rendezvous in the woods at night is sometimes suggested as being an autobiographical depiction of Shakespeare's own courtship with Anne Hathaway in the wooded places around their home town.  *If* that is indeed the case and the emotions of Midsummer's characters mirror his own, Shakespeare was quick to fall in love and when he did he fell *hard*.  This assumption (along with information cherry-picked from the Sonnets) formed the basis for Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman's screenplay for the film *Shakespeare In Love*.Shakespeare's plays express a wide (to put it mildly) variety of human opinion and emotion.  His characters are sometimes described (particularly by Professor Harold Bloom of Yale University) as \"invented humans\" with all the subtle complexity and variation of real human beings.  These same remarkable traits that make his plays unique also make them fruitless for separating the author's opinions from those of the characters.  For example: I sometimes hear the assertion that all we can determine from the plays is that he didn't like dogs because nowhere in the cannon are dogs mentioned positively.  This of course teaches us nothing, but it illustrates just how difficult it is to determine the individual traits of a man with such a gift for peering into the souls of others with nothing to go on but theatrical literature.  All the plays really teach us about the man is that he had a staggering command of the English language (even inventing new words when his own were insufficient), a remarkable sense of human empathy, a terrific feel for comic and dramatic timing, and a chilling gift for philosophical introspection.It is widely presumed that Shakespeare's sonnets represent his own intimate feelings and may not have been intended for publication.  If it is possible to know anything about his personality and thought process, that's where we're most likely to find it.  Unfortunately they offer more questions than answers.The first 126 sonnets are addressed to an unidentified young male (the \"fair youth\").  The first 17 implore the young man to find a suitable wife and marry so that his virtues might live on after him.  Then, in sonnet 18 (\"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?\") the sonnets begin to take on a romantic tone towards the reader and there are occasional mentions of jealousy over a rival poet in #78-86.  Sonnet # 20 explicitly laments that the fair youth is not a woman.  These early sonnets, taken collectively, have sparked an argument among artists and historians as to whether sonnets 18-126 are evidence of a homosexual affair or if the love being expressed is entirely platonic.Suddenly, beginning in sonnet 127 the poems are being addressed to a new subject: The Dark Lady.  Sonnets 127-152 are unambiguously sexual in nature.  #151 is particularly risqu\u00e9 and bawdy and is often cited to distinguish the relationships between the Fair Youth and Dark Lady to counter claims of Shakespeare's possible bisexuality.  This portion of the sonnets is frequently used to suggest that Shakespeare was unfaithful in his marriage while in London at least once.  His passion for his Dark Lady is the kind of smoldering, half-guilty hunger that seems more suited to a secret lover than a distant spouse.I could go on and on about this topic and books about this very question are an industry unto themselves.  Our lack of knowledge about Shakespeare's personality tempts us to project our own personalities and the conventions of our times on him, but the only honest answer is that we don't know and are not likely to ever find out.For further reading:[Shakespeare: The Evidence: Unlocking the Mysteries of the Man and His Work](_URL_2_) by By Ian Wilson, 1993[Will in the World: How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare](_URL_0_), by Stephen Greenblatt, 2004[Who's Who in Shakespeare's England](_URL_1_) by Alan and Veronica Palmer, 1981", "label": 0}, {"content": "Shakespeare was a very sociable person, and he was a very good friend to his friends and family.

To most people in the modern world the first image that comes to mind is Harry Potter making things fly around the room, shooting big, violent spells everywhere. Historically, this is not how witches were seen. Magic was almost always related to a relationship with the Devil, which made it inherently evil. The witches gained their power by worshipping Satan. By doing his bidding on Earth, he in turn granted them with extraordinary powers. Their resulting magic was much more subtle. Most reports from Europe and the Americas allege that a certain person cast some magic upon a cow and killed it or caused some crops to fail. Magic was used to harm others, but not in the direct way that we often see in popular culture. Take the Salem Witch Trials, perhaps the most famous example in American history. When a few girls started acting in a strange manner, screaming and writhing to draw attention, it was assumed that people had cast spells upon them to make them suffer. The results of this case aren't really important for your question, but this would be an example of a way that people believed magic took a direct and tangible effect.Arresting and executing the witches was simply reasserting God's will on Earth. The witches were under guard and were never expected to bust out riding a broom while breathing fire. The most they could do was, in a rather lengthy time, slowly poison one's soul or cause incremental physical ailments.  So, since most of the time charges instead focused on abstract allegations of sabotage and rarely human violence, they were not too worried. Most mass-hysteria episodes coincided with difficult times economically, politically, or environmentally, but it was always easier to say, \"My cow died and I hate that girl. She's a witch!\" The girl could take revenge, but it'd be rather difficult for her to find the time to slowly implement her incremental magic if she's constantly under surveillance and then burned to death. Edit: Sorry for the lack of sources and formatting, I'm a little bit new here. * Dr. Brian Pavlac's book *Witch Hunts in the Western World: Persecution and Punishment from the Inquisition through the Salem Trials* is a good overview of the topic. If you want a quick version, his website lays it out pretty well with a few FAQs. For example, regarding their conception of magic he writes, \"Usually the danger was seen in an organized conspiracy led by the Devil. Or the concern was witches causing harm (maleficia) through spells: raising storms, killing people or livestock, and/or causing bad luck.\" As people became more and more hysterical, the government almost always stepped in to counteract the Devil's influence, so it was very much an institutionalized phenomenon. He also briefly comments on why outbreaks occurred in some places more than others. He writes, \"Historians are still trying to explain the reasons for this great variety in witch hunting.  Important factors could have been:  the power of the central government; the independence of local authorities; tensions created by war, failing economies, or famine; and uncertainties about religious conformity.\" For more info on the Salem witch trials... * The rather famous Cotton Mather left a firsthand account of the trials. He describes how New England culture understood magic and its effects throughout. For example, he wrote the following of the first case that triggered the trials.  > It was not long before one of her Sisters, an two of her Brothers, were seized, in.Order one after another with Affects' like those that molested her. Within a fe weeks, they were all four tortured every where in a manners very grievous, that it would have broke an heart of stone t have seen their Agonies. Skilful Physicians were consulted for their Help, and particularly our worthy and prudent Friend Dr. Thomas Oakes,' who found himself so affronted by the Dist'empers of the children, that he concluded nothing but an hellish Witchcraft could be the Original of these Maladies. As you can see they didn't believe witchcraft worked anything like we do today. Because of this their fear of a witch locked up in a jail cell was naturally much different than our's would be. There are many more books on the Salem Witch Trials, and it really is fascinating to look at why the entire thing happened. * I'd recommend *The Salem Witch Trials: A Day-By-Day Chronicle of a Community Under Siege* by Maryilynne K.

Oviedo then tells us in his Historia de las Indias >  And another one they called don Juan de Castilla, and others they gave other names still, following their wishes [sic], or their patrons allowed to be given to them, in accordance with the Catholic Church. ... the prince [don Juan] wanted this [don Juan de Castilla] with him, and wanted him to stay in his royal house so that he would be well treaded as if he was the son of an important gentleman [or knight] whom he loved very much. ... and I [Oviedo] saw this indio who spoke already well Castilian, and after two years he died. *All the other indios returned to this island in the second voyage of the Admiral [Columbus]*.[my transl.]*So of the circa 7 Ta\u00ednos all were brought back to the Carribbean to aid with conversion, except for one who stayed with prince don Juan until his death two years later.* For Columbus there were no problems with taking these indigenous people captive, since at that point, they could still be seen in Europe as \"barbarians\" according to Aristotelian ideas - without having converted to Christianity they could be described as inferior, pagan and \"less than human\", and according to Columbus were \"fit to be ordered about and made to work\". The Spanish monarchs were thus very early trafficers in native slaves. While the Spanish Crown at this point started issuing decrees to protect the natives and to convert them, at first such commands were mostly ignored by Columbus in the Carribbean. Interestingly, Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas saw these Ta\u00ednos in Seville as a young man. He would serve under Columbus and later become a strong advocate for the Americas' native population, which directly led to the Leyes Nuevas of 1542 officially ending native slavery (although it continued unofficially,  on which more below). These Ta\u00ednos brought as slaves to Castille were a mere \"footnote\" for Columbus as proof for his own explorations - he loses interest when they are declared not to be slaves. But I think it's important to note for context that they were far from alone in their fate. **First** off: More slave shipments followed, including one of circa 600 Carribbean natives, and one of circa 500 Ta\u00ednos in 1500 to Spain. Many of them died partly due to disease, but also probalby since they were completely uprooted from theid environments.In 1508 a census listed that only 60.000 native people were left in Hispaniola (modern day Dom-Rep and Haiti) - there are estimates of ca. 3 million Tainos in the Carribbean before contact, although I'm not sure about the most current numbers here. Las Casas stated that by 1542 (the time of the Leyes Nuevas) there were only about 200 Ta\u00ednos left in Hispaniola, a similiar fate shared by other native groups in the Carribbean. Charles C. Mann in 1493 notes that although no Ta\u00ednos have survived today, according to modern research their DNA is possibly carried on by Dominicans of Afrcan or European descent today.**Second** I'll briefly note that native slavery did not end abruptly with the Leyes Nuevas, and that this was a practice spanning the Spanish Americas, Carribbean, Portugal and Spain. Nancy van Deusen has written a great book (\"Global Indios\") on this, where she describes distinct phases: First between 1500-1542 \"the enslavement of hundreds of thousands of people from America and elsewhere\" (including Africa) due to the \"open-ended exceptions of just war and ransom\". Just war had served as a justification for war against muslims in medieval Iberia and continued to be used for conquest campaigns in the Americas. A second phase begins with the New Laws of 1542 under Charles and heavily influenced by Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas. These already mentioned laws stated that native Americans were human, vassals of the Spanish Crown and free - effectively prohibiting enslavement of native people for just war or ransom. However, the New Laws included important loopholes which led to enslavement of natives continuing circa until the late 16th/early 17th century, albeit in much smaller numbers (numbering rather in the thousands regarding Castile). This meant that native people from Spanish America were still being brought to Spain at that time, often via Portugal. They would then use legal mechanisms open to them to argue for freedom, often succesfully. [(I talk some more about native people and mestizos in Spain in this older post)](_URL_0_)-------I'd like to close by steering a bit more away from the question: with some thoughts by Pagden on what effects such displacement could have on native Americans. He goes some more into the impossibilities for native Americans to be recognized or to express themselves. He's not talking here \"only\" about the Ta\u00ednos brought over by Columbus, but also about native people brought to Europe by later expeditions, into the 18th century: >  Samples of minerals and plants, once relocated in their new 'centres of calculations,' can be made intelligible by reference to other minerals and plants. Humans, however, rarely transport so well. They die  or become meaningless in their new contexts. ... These creatures [sic] are only ever of interest as representatives of their own worlds. Although they are here among us, they are so only because we cannot easily go to them. If, like poor Pocahontas, they leave the shelter of their own exoticism, they very soon perish. ... Exposed to Europe, the 'savage' can only maintain his position of detachment for a short while. The critique of our ways, which nearly all such visitors express, will lose its force the longer the critic remains absent from the culture which made it possible at all. In Europe he runs the risk of becoming a mere ranter. What happens to him, as it must to all travellers, is a loss of identity. (p.31-32)So that for Pagden, early modern Europeans tended to view native Americans in Europe as mere \"curiosities\" of an \"exotic world\". While for the native people themselves, their critique of European ways falls on deaf ears, and they lose something essential. Native slavery to Europe ended in the 17th century, but this did not make native people in Europe any more welcome or accepted.----------  \u200bJon T.

Does it have a particular significance? I don't believe it has a particular significance in Hawaiian history, as we don't have any written record of the Hawaiian language before approx. 1830 AD. Polynesian languages in general, and Hawaiian in particular, were purely oral languages for the vast majority of their histories. Christian missionaries assisted in creation of an alphabet for Hawaiian in 1826, in pursuit of a way to compose the Bible into Hawaiian, and the first complete Hawaiian grammar book (\u00dcber die Hawaiische Sprache) was published in Berlin in 1837. That being the case, we have no written histories to refer to in our study of Hawaiian history. We must instead use a combination of oral histories and comparative linguistics to make educated guesses about the origins of the original settlers of Hawaii, and their knowledge of the wider world. Using lexiostatistics, language experts are able to use several hundred words that are common to any language (blood, water, 1-10, hair) , and compare them to the same small vocabulary of words in another language. By doing so they are looking for cognates, identical sounds, similar sounds, or dissimilar sounds. Languages that are extremely similar, with many cognates and similar sounds for the same words, can be reasonably determined to be related. For instance, English and Hawaiian share 0 cognates or similar sounding words for the same 200 concepts, while Tahitian and Hawaiian share 152 cognates or similar sounding words out of 200. They are also able to use the drift of sounds in common words to determine how lately one language has split off from another, to give an idea of how long two communities with similar languages have been separated.Using this lexiostatistic theory on Hawaiian, we have been able to determine that Hawaii was likely settled at the latest by 800 AD, although it is possible there were people on the islands as early as 300 AD. They likely came from the Southern Marquesas, a chain of islands in French Polynesia about 4,000 kilometers to the SE of Hawaii (see map [here](_URL_0_). These initial settlers would have brought with them the classic Polynesian agricultural system of taro, banana, breadfruit, sugarcane, chickens, pigs, and dogs. There is some evidence that there was an invasion of Hawaii in approx. 1300 AD by an expedition or migration from Tahiti, but this is contentious. Some experts subscribe to the theory of Tahitian conquest in one large migration, whereas others argue for a more gradual exchange between the two cultures, with a series of small migrations between the two island groups. The invasion theory is partially supported by two Hawaiian oral legends, that of Hawaiiloa and Pa'ao. In one, after discovering the island by accident, the great hero Hawaiiloa travels from Kahiki (Tahiti) with his family and several other navigators to found a new settlement on the big island of Hawaii. In the other, Pa'ao, a priest and navigator, comes to Hawaii from Kahiki ; which in this case is understood to be either Tahiti or Samoa. I believe that for Hawaiians, Kahiki eventually came to be a term that encompassed any land that was not Hawaii. Pa'ao was said to have come to Hawaii during the reign of one of it's legendary kings, but eventually this line of kings became corrupted and degenerate. Pa'ao thus went back to Kahiki to fetch a \"pure\" king, who then came to rule over Hawaii. This king was then looked to as the progenitor of the Hawaiian royal line, particularly that of King Kalakaua. Of course, any such oral history has to be taken with a grain of salt.However, all sources agree that there was some limited contact between Hawaii and several islands in French Polynesia between approx. 800 AD and 1300 AD; likely consisting of a mix of small migrations, military campaigns, and trade missions. These voyages seem to have dropped off after approx. 1300 AD, for unknown reasons. By 1778, when Captain Cook made the first European contact with Hawaii, the original settlement and possible later conquest of Hawaii had long passed into myth. In 1414, we would only be approx. one century removed from the latest migration from Tahiti to Hawaii (setting aside if it was a conquest or not). So it is possible that Hawaiians living in this era would have had some knowledge of Tahiti, and the chain of islands far to the south from whence these settlers came. This is not to say however, that they would have any conception of the vast landmasses and completely different geographies and cultures of North and South America, Asia, or even Australia. I believe it would be safe to say that in 1414 Hawaiians would not have been aware of the existence of the Asian or American continents.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Hawaiian Islands were discovered by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan in 1419.

I am far from an expert on tea husbandry/horticulture, however, there are experts in this field! Purdue's Argiculture department has a division dedicated to horticulture and there is a [course dedicated to the history of horticulture](_URL_3_), in which they dedicate an [entire lecture to tea, colonialism, and the interconnection of the two](_URL_2_) in ending the longest standing empire (the various Chinese dynasties employing very similar government structures) with modern states (the Chinese Republic followed by today's communist party). Much of what I'll say below is drawn from that resource. In a very real sense, the European drive to colonize China and the ways in which it utilized foreign territories to produce goods (India, Indonesia, etc.) was in no small part driven by the incredibly large position tea occupied in European society and business at that time.From that resource, I believe it is fair to say that the way we enjoy teas today, often as \"adulterated\" blends, is quite different from how the Chinese enjoyed their tea more than 2 centuries ago. While the Chinese had blends, from what I gather in that resource they were much more conservative with the blending (as they were with many things at that time). On page 9 that resource goes into explicit detail about what exactly constituted tea, and that some of today's most popular blends like Earl Grey were a solution to the impossible to satisfy demand from Europeans and would have been considered by Chinese authorities at the time inferior or adulterated. Because there was only so much tea to be distributed among European traders as all trade in CHina at that time moved through the [Canton System](_URL_1_) and quantities were determined by the emperor, ways of leavening or diluting the tea content by adulteration became much more prominent as economic incentive grew, first by the Chinese looking to meet European quotas, and then by Europeans looking to either make up for shortfalls between production and demand (even after this dilution by Chinese growers) or just looking to expand their profit by spreading the product out. There were even cottage industries around false teas in Europe made of such delicious things as dried sheep scat and elderberry leaves, not as a reflection of what people liked, but because people in Europe had an inexhaustible demand for the stuff and, because production was so far removed from the consumer, those less acquainted with it apparently had a hard time finding unadulterated products. For a slight tangent but fascinating read about the clash of a modern and ancient culture, [see the letter sent by the Qianlong Emperor to George III's request for direct access to Chinese manufacturers](_URL_0_), in no small part motivated by the desire for more tea.There is also the question of the tea ceremony: how the tea is prepared and consumed, not just the tea itself. In this regard, tea today (at least as North Americans and Europeans) is different from how the Chinese and those in their cultural sphere enjoyed tea. When you view \"teacup\" under google images, you'll see a thin porcelain cup with a fragile handle. While we imagine porcelain as a uniqely Chinese export, so much so we call that style of dinnerware \"china\", and porcelain definitely was an exclusively Chinese product until the advent of Meissen porcelain and the release of Chinese trade secrets by a Jesuit priest in the early 18th century, that style of teacup with a handle is distinctly European. Chinese and Japanese cups were handle-less, as the tea was served after being cooled to specific temperatures and the drinker was supposed to be able to handle the cup easily. The Chinese and neighbors in their cultural sphere (Japan, Korea) prepared their tea in kettles, meaning the vessel that boiled the water was also the serving vessel. There were no ceramics makers in Europe at that time (pre-18th century) advanced enough to produce vessels that could withstand that kind of direct heating temperature without cracking, so they generally prepared their water in a tea kettle made of metal and then transferred the heated water after it had cooled somewhat into a ceramic or sometimes decorated metal tea pot.With regards to the question of \"Red Rose Tea\" as an importer and handler for teas, that has very much been how Europeans engaged with tea since the 16th century. In fact, some of todays most famous producers such as Twinnings are explicitly discussed in that second link.Some interesting tidbits I was not aware of (and which I assume to be true from Purdue's reputation): I associate certain teas very strongly with India: chai, masala chai, and Darjeeling (named after the region), and they are the second largest consumer/producer of tea in the world. However, from that second link, while India's tea culture is not exclusively a legacy of British colonialism as there are recordings of Indians drinking tea prior to the Empire, the pervasive scale of today's tea culture in India is. Prior to British colonialism, tea was not widely available to the lower class and most of it was imported from China, chai itself being the Hindi loan word of the Chinese cha (cf. also Japan's \u304a\u8336, an etymological origin I can speak to more). The British began industrial/large scale cultivation of tea in India, initially using smuggled tea seeds and Chinese laborers, as a way of meeting endless demand. Today India is the second largest producer and consumer of tea in the world but that would not have been what European traders would have seen 2 centuries ago.", "label": 0}, {"content": "Tea has been brewed for thousands of years.

The Articles government was very much a continuation of the Continental Congress that had governed the colonies during the war. Furthermore, many of the men leading the Articles government (and later the early Constitutional government) were the same men who had been in control of the colonial governments before the war.And those colonial governments had been rather autonomous. It's pretty hard for a king or parliament to micromanage a colony when its on the other side of an ocean that takes months to cross. The colonies had been fairly self governing for a while, including their own representative bodies. The colonists started getting angry when the empire started trying to impose more central control through taxation and trade controls. In many ways, the colonists already had their own independent society.So you can see that **the American Revolution didn't totally upend American society the way the French Revolution tried to do**. It wasn't nearly as radical. In France they were lopping off the heads of nobles, while in the US the wealthy elites were the ones making the new rules. That's why they were so big on property rights and fearful of democracy. As far as revolutions go, the American Revolution was very conservative.Finally, the colonial masses were not rebelling against their native government as the French proletariat was. It was the local governments rebelling against a far away imperial government. So instead of the socioeconomic situation deteriorating until the country exploded in violent, emotional, uncontrollable mass rebellion, there was an educated political class leading the colonies through a more procedural independence.Really, calling both what happened in the US between 1775-1783 and what happened in France a few years later 'revolutions' is misleading. They were different types of events in very different circumstances. The American colonists weren't overthrowing the government of  Britain, they were seceding from it.Now the modern US government has changed a lot since the revolution. But that happened over the course of decades, and it did certainly come at its own deep cost. The American Civil War should be seen as the final conclusion of the revolution as it's when we truly defined the national project that the founders had begun. Their intelligence and willingness to make this country work is what held the union together as long as it did, but they were only able to do so because they were leading a society that was already stable and fairly prosperous.Edit: I failed to mention one thing that I can't believe I forgot. The frontier. Throughout early US history, if you had a problem with the way the society around you worked or your place in it, you could just move out west and start a life for yourself.A lot of violent revolutions start due to wealth disparity. The proletariat feel like they have no options and no control over their lives because of a system set up by elites to use and abuse the common man. The situation builds up like a pressure cooker until an event happens that pushes the people past their breaking point (such as a famine or the murder of a popular idol). Then the whole thing just explodes violently and uncontrollably.Now, there were and are definitely powerful wealthy families in the US. But the common people rarely got desperate enough to raise arms because they always had another option: move out to the frontier and make a self sufficient life with your own land without ever needing to engage with markets controlled by wealthy capitalists. You won't have the latest fashions or gadgets, and it'll be a tough, risky life, but you'll get to live on your own terms. You'll never be dictated to by any boss, or manager, or clock, or whistle, not by anyone other than mother nature. Early American society never had any of the type of widespread mass uprisings that lead to dictatorship because there was always a release valve.Edit2: Thanks for the gold!", "label": 0}, {"content": "The American Revolution was a series of coups, purges and dictatorships.

The \"one year tour\" system resulted in many cases of combat fatigue due to varying mission loads, and Lieutenant General George Kenney, the commander of Allied Air Forces in the Southwest Pacific Area as well as the Fifth Air Force, also found that it resulted in shortages of replacement crews as too many men were becoming eligible to be sent home. In November 1942, Major General James \"Jimmy\" Doolittle established 25-30 missions or 150-200 flight hours as the goal for his Twelfth Air Force pilots in North Africa. Doolittle consulted with Major General Carl Spaatz (at the time, the overall commander of Army Air Forces operations in Europe and the Eighth Air Force) and Brigadier General Ira C. Eaker (at the time, the commander of VIII Bomber Command, Eighth Air Force), and they agreed upon the former's scheme for initial use in Europe. Brigadier General Nathaniel F. Twining, the commander of the Thirteenth Air Force in the Pacific, instead adopted a \"points\" system in January 1943 for his fighter and bomber pilots that took into account the number of months overseas, the number of flight hours, and the number of individual missions flown.From May 1943 to January 1944, commanders in theaters (that is, the commanders of numbered Air Forces and higher organizations) were given exclusive jurisdiction by the War Department over the number of missions their crews flew before getting leave or returning home. When General Spaatz assumed command of the Northwest African Air Forces, he proceeded to limit his medium and heavy bomber crewmen to 150-250 flight hours (respectively) or 50 missions, after which their combat effectiveness would be assessed. Major General Lewis H. Brereton, the new commander of the Ninth Air Force (re-established in England in October 1943), set 50 missions as the tour of duty for his medium bomber pilots, and 200 flight hours for his fighter pilots.As *Luftwaffe* opposition was gradually forced out of the sky over western Europe in the several months before D-Day (a necessary component for a successful invasion) due to an ever-increasing number of aircraft (maximum capacity in England was reached in May 1944; 82 units at 86 stations, including 66 airfields) and the aggressive policy of new Eighth Air Force commander James Doolittle (if it flies, kill it; if it doesn't fly, find where it sits and kill it), the Army Air Forces adopted a policy of \"maximum service;\" >  The Commanding General of the AAF directed the commanders to do two things. First, \"If you have made any policies or understandings that combat personnel will be returned to  the United States after fulfilling such arbitrary conditions as I have just described, those policies will be rescinded at once.\" Second, the impression that no man would be required to serve more than one tour in combat was to be \"unmistakably corrected.\" While Arnold recognized that \"this radical change in personnel policy will present difficult problems, particularly insofar as morale is concerned,\" he had \"absolute faith...in the intelligence and good, hard, common sense of the American fighting men in understanding the necessity for the change and accepting it.\" He was counting on the commanders \"to put it over.\"Commanders in theaters responded by de-empahasizing the coveted \"mission yardstick.\" Doolittle cancelled Eaker's 25-30 mission/150-200 hour program when he gained command in January 1944, and Brereton rescinded his 50 mission/200 hour scheme. The former offered 30 missions as a minimum, and later promised his men that they would be rotated home \"when the efficiency of the unit was affected,\" and that no man would have to fly more than 35 missions. This program resulted in much grumbling, and several flyers threatened to quit. General Eaker was also displeased; >  ...The thing that makes it most difficult to maintain morale is to have no policy, leaving clearly in the mind of the combat crewman the belief that he must go on until he cracks up and becomes a jibbering idiot or an admitted coward, or until he is killed. We are all of one mind that the effectiveness of tactical units cannot be maintained under this condition.From February to September 1944, Army Air Forces commanders in Europe experimented with a leave program, offering either noncombat duty in the theater or a 30-day furlough in the United States, in addition to the prospect of permanent rotation. By September, it was recognized that the program was a failure; many men who were eligible for temporary return to the United States wished to stay there, or were \"burned out\" and unsuitable for *any* further combat duty. The implied tour length before relief for Eighth Air Force heavy bomber crews was formally increased to 30 missions on April 1, 1944, and then 35 missions on June 6, 1944. In July 1944, the U.S. Seventh Air Force in the Pacific adopted a 30-mission yardstick for its heavy bomber pilots. With the failure of the leave program, the Eighth Air Force went back to a policy of returning crewmen home when they began to become fatigued; oftentimes this happened before 30 or 35 missions. As the pace of operations in the Pacific increased, so did the number of required missions; in October 1944 in the Seventh Air Force, 40 missions in a heavy bomber, 60 missions in a medium bomber, and an eight-month tour for fighter and photoreconnaissance pilots. Similar to the Thirteenth Air Force, the Fifth Air Force adopted a points system to determine eligibility for rotation in September 1944.Throughout the war, there was no protracted shortage of new crews to take the place of those lost through combat or fatigue, although the throughput process sometimes caused problems, especially with Fifth Air Force early in the war. The Army Air Forces suspended completely the procurement of new aviation cadets from March to November 1944 after a wildly successful recruiting drive in the last five months of 1943 and first three months of 1944.This glut of replacements along with declining enemy resistance allowed for greater flexibility in rotation beginning in September 1944, and the Eighth Air Force proceeded to delete *all* references to tour length or mission requirements in the fall of 1944, relying only on fatigue and unit effectiveness to determine when a man should be relieved. In September 1944, the Twelfth and Fifteenth Air Forces in the Mediterranean Theater adopted the following informal tour lengths for their crews, which didn't differ much from those in effect before;* Heavy bomber, photoreconnaissance, and and weather aircraft, 50 sorties;* Long range fighters, 70 sorties;* Short-range fighters, 100 sorties. >  Between September 1944 and April 1945, bomber crews of the Eighth Air Force averaged 35 missions, while fighter pilots flew about 270 hours prior to rotation. >  Between November 1944 and May 1945, bomber crews of Ninth Air Force averaged 65 missions, and fighter pilots 150-200 hours.I talk more about the situation in Europe regarding missions in [this post here](_URL_1_), as well as the conditions in one particular German prisoner of war camp for downed airmen, but I'll repeat my comments below.  >  As German fighter opposition decreased throughout early 1944, the threshold to return home was increased from 25 to 30, and then 35 missions; >  Date|Bomber Crewmen (1)|Fighter Crewmen (2)|Photo Recon (2)|Weather Recon (2):--|:--|:--|:--|:--Prior to 01 Apr 1944|25 Missions|--|--|--\t \t 01 Apr to 06 Jun 1944|30 Missions (A)|200 hours|--|--After 06 Jun 1944|35 Missions (B)|300 hours|200 hours|500 hours >   >  1.

But, on the contrary, while slaves made up 40% of the total population of the South, only 25 percent of free families, most of them white, owned any slaves at all, and fully one-half of this minority (12.5%) held fewer than five slaves. Only an owner of twenty or more slaves, and of substantial land, could qualify as a planter, and fewer than 10 percent of slave-holding families qualified. The plantation elite of the antebellum South made up less than 3 percent of the free population in the region and less than 2 percent of the total free and slave populations combined.Let's put this into context. You probably own stocks and bonds \u2500 investment documents either through a mutual fund, direct investment, your college fund or a 401(k). A slave was a big investment. On a plantation with 20 slaves, the value of those slaves (in 1860) would be greater than the value of the land and all the improvements \u2500 houses, barns, orchards, fields, irrigation \u2500 on it.[In fact, the value of a single slave was so great that in 1950, only *2 percent* of Americans held stocks worth more than the *1860* value (inflation adjusted) of a single slave.](_URL_0_) Restated: More than 10 times as many Americans relied on slavery for their wealth in 1860 than relied on the stock market for their wealth 90 years later.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The South was a very racist place, and slavery was a huge part of the culture.

Organizations like the Female Association for Promoting the Manufacture and Use of Free Cotton, the Free Produce Society of Pennsylvania, and the American Free Produce Association tried to encourage and facilitate these products. For example, in 1829, the Female Association for Promoting the Manufacture and Use of Free Cotton had just over 2,500 pounds of freely-produced cotton spun and made into various garments and bedding. The movement was, at the time, thought to be directly tied to the Quaker religion, but more recent scholarship shows that it was not solely Quakers who participated. Philadelphia was the stronghold of this movement, and by the 1850s the city had several free-produce shops.However, there were challenges. Like cruelty-free products today, free-labor goods were typically more expensive. For example, when the American Free Produce Association attempted to acquire freely-made cotton from North Carolina, they found it difficult to competitively price the cotton because the local farmers found the work dangerous. Some supporters attempted to secure free labor production in Africa or the Caribbean and bring costs down, but these schemes never really took shape. Some also found the quality of free labor products poorer; Frances Ellen Watkins Harper noted upon buying a free produce dress that the cloth was rougher than cloth produced by slave labor. The movement never really took off en masse, and its supporters even struggled to convince other abolitionists or opponents of slavery to participate. A telling critique from one African-American abolitionist in the 1850s lamented that other free black Philadelphians would still choose to buy slave-produced goods.Source: Faulkner, Carol. \"The Root of the Evil: Free Produce and Radical Antislavery, 1820-1860. *Journal of the Early Republic* 27, no. 3 (Fall 2007): 377-405.Edit for clarification: the contemporary lingo was \"slave labor\" or some variant like \"unfree labor\" for, well, enslaved labor, and \"free labor\" for work done by free people (**not** work done for free by slaves).", "label": 0}, {"content": "The abolitionist movement was a major force in the development of the American economy.

The Romans did develop a particularly sophisticated messaging system, based on a series of watch towers, flags and bonfire beacons. In Britain, this sysyem was extensive between forts and along the roads and the coast, and the remains of some of these towers can still be seen in Cornwall. During the Anglo-Saxon period, many Roman sites were often incorporated into an extensive, but admittedly less sophisticated beacon system similar to that which you can see in *Lord of the Rings* which stretched inland from the coast and also along the Danelaw border.The Roman system worked on a system of multiple flags, but also had 'crash' bonfires for sending out a generic alert in a hurry when there wasn't time to send a full message. You can see representations of these signalling stations on Trajan's Column, with soldiers atop towers waving banners. The system was supposedly quite sophisticated, with different combinations to indicate the numbers and composition of a hostile force, as well as the vague direction of travel, i.e. \"500 horse and 1500 foot moving south\". As to the speed over distance of this system, I can't say, but the *Saga of Haakon the Good* says that the English-style beacon system installed in Norway by Haakon following his return from the court of \u00c6thelstan could raise the entire country to muster within a week. Sophisticated signals are less instantaneous than a bonfire, but to simply pass a message rather than to also muster a fighting force would streamline things. Perhaps if every single signal station was set up, perfectly prepared and ready to go at all times, it might be possible.Some reading:Luttwak (1976), *The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire: From the First Century A.D. to the Third*Reynolds (2013), *Landscapes of Defence*Bachrach (2016), *Warfare in Medieval Europe 400-1453*", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Romans used a system of flags to communicate with each other.

He felt that this was a sort of safety valve used by the slave owners to release built up tension. Nothing altruistic about it. I highly doubt it was a practice employed by all owners, but some slaves appear to in fact have had some time to themselves. Here are the relevant passages.  >  My term of actual service to Mr. Edward Covey ended on Christmas day, 1833. The days between Christmas and New Year's day are allowed as holidays; and, accordingly, we were not required to perform any labor, more than to feed and take care of the stock. This time we regarded as our own, by the grace of our masters; and we therefore used or abused it nearly as we pleased. Those of us who had families at a distance, were generally allowed to spend the whole six days in their society. This time, however, was spent in various ways. The staid, sober, thinking and industrious ones of our number would employ themselves in making corn-brooms, mats, horse-collars, and baskets; and another class of us would spend the time in hunting opossums, hares, and coons. But by far the larger part engaged in such sports and merriments as playing ball, wrestling, running foot-races, fiddling, dancing, and drinking whisky; and this latter mode of spending the time was by far the most agreeable to the feelings of our masters. A slave who would work during the holidays was considered by our masters as scarcely deserving them. He was regarded as one who rejected the favor of his master. It was deemed a disgrace not to get drunk at Christmas; and he was regarded as lazy indeed, who had not provided himself with the necessary means, during the year, to get whisky enough to last him through Christmas. > From what I know of the effect of these holidays upon the slave, I believe them to be among the most effective means in the hands of the slaveholder in keeping down the spirit of insurrection. Were the slaveholders at once to abandon this practice, I have not the slightest doubt it would lead to an immediate insurrection among the slaves. These holidays serve as conductors, or safety-valves, to carry off the rebellious spirit of enslaved humanity. But for these, the slave would be forced up to the wildest desperation; and woe betide the slaveholder, the day he ventures to remove or hinder the operation of those conductors! I warn him that, in such an event, a spirit will go forth in their midst, more to be dreaded than the most appalling earthquake. > The holidays are part and parcel of the gross fraud, wrong, and inhumanity of slavery. They are professedly a custom established by the benevolence of the slaveholders; but I undertake to say, it is the result of selfishness, and one of the grossest frauds committed upon the down-trodden slave. They do not give the slaves this time because they would not like to have their work during its continuance, but because they know it would be unsafe to deprive them of it. This will be seen by the fact, that the slaveholders like to have their slaves spend those days just in such a manner as to make them as glad of their ending as of their beginning. Their object seems to be, to disgust their slaves with freedom, by plunging them into the lowest depths of dissipation. For instance, the slaveholders not only like to see the slave drink of his own accord, but will adopt various plans to make him drunk. One plan is, to make bets on their slaves, as to who can drink the most whisky without getting drunk; and in this way they succeed in getting whole multitudes to drink to excess. Thus, when the slave asks for virtuous freedom, the cunning slaveholder, knowing his ignorance, cheats him with a dose of vicious dissipation, artfully labelled with the name of liberty. The most of us used to drink it down, and the result was just what might be supposed; many of us were led to think that there was little to choose between liberty and slavery. We felt, and very properly too, that we had almost as well be slaves to man as to rum. So, when the holidays ended, we staggered up from the filth of our wallowing, took a long breath, and marched to the field,\u2014feeling, upon the whole, rather glad to go, from what our master had deceived us into a belief was freedom, back to the arms of slavery.

First, it perpetuates a popular myth that immigrants, especially Irish Catholic immigrants, were the bulk of rank and file in the Union army. To quote James McPherson: > \"The substantial number of immigrants in the Union army gave rise to longstanding southern myth that \"the majority of Yankee soldiers were foreign hirelings.\" But in fact quite the opposite was true. Immigrants were proportionately under-represented in the Union's armed services. Of some two million white soldiers and sailors, half a million had been born abroad. While immigrants therefore constituted 25 percent of the servicemen, 30 of the males of military age in the Union states were foreign-born. Despite the fighting reputation of the Irish Brigade, the Irish were the most underrepresented group in proportion to population, followed by German Catholics. Other immigrant groups enlisted in rough proportion to their share of the population.\"McPherson notes that those who enlisted or were drafted into the Union army tended to be disproportionately Protestant and skilled laborers or farmers, not working class Catholic immigrants. Which would make sense because especially in a place like New York City the latter groups tended to be extremely loyal to the Democratic Party and suspicious of a war effort largely run by Republicans such as Lincoln and Seward. Indeed, it was the Democratic Party that promoted the \"rich man's war, poor man's fight\" slogan in political debates over passing the 1863 Draft Bill (the passage of which led to the July 1863 Draft Riots in New York City, which are depicted in a historically distorted and whitewashed form in the film). For what it's worth, according to McPherson 98 percent of the men drafted in heavily Irish-immigrant districts ended up paying commutation fees or hired substitutes (mostly though Democratic political machine Tammany Hall funds).That's some background. I slightly sidestepped the question as to whether the scene in the film actually happened. It seems like Scorsese is depicting the scene mostly as a metaphor for the myth mentioned above, ie, that immigrants \"fresh off the boat\" were signed up to serve in a meat grinder (hence the coffins being unloaded right next to the fresh volunteers), so I don't think the viewer is supposed to take the scene as the literal truth.I've downplayed the role that Irish immigrants played relatively speaking in the Union army, but (as McPherson himself admits), there were notable exceptions, most notably the Irish Brigade, raised in New York by Capt. Thomas Francis Meagher and Corcoran's Legion formed by Colonel Michael Corcoran (both were Irish immigrants and connected to the Fenian movement). It looks like the recruiting scene is a reference to recruiters outside Castle Clinton: the National Parks Service said that recruiters were located here to recruit recent Irish immigrants, but they are vague as to if this was before the Civil War, or before. However, Irish historian and archaeologist Damian Shiels (who wrote *The Irish in the American Civil War*) looked at the recruiting in this area and found a letter where the New York Commissioners for Emigration explicitly banned the New York County Volunteers Recruiting Committee from recruiting in Castle Garden (specifically because it would spread the idea that new immigrants were being duped into joining the Union Army, and the bad international press this could cause). Shiels' takeaway is therefore:  > \"The more I investigate the Irish experience, the more apparent it is that the type of incident portrayed in Gangs of New York rarely, if ever, occurred. Far from being duped, it was much more likely that many of these men had travelled to the United States with the express intention of joining the military, in the hope of benefiting from the financial rewards available for doing so. This was the primary motivation for Irish enlistment in the Union Army from at least 1863 onwards. These men were not stupid- they came from a country where enlistment in the British Army for economic reasons was commonplace, and they came informed about the Civil War.\"Sources: James McPherson. *Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era*National Park Service.

NES developers simply had the freedom to express their sense of humor, so many of them did so.The first \"eggplant game\" released in America was probably Dig Dug II (1982). But like Ice Climber (1985), it did not cast eggplants in a negative light. You collect eggplants, among many other things, for points. There are at least eight game series for the NES/Famicom that feature eggplants in some fashion and roughly half use eggplants purely as a treasure to collect: _URL_4_So why were eggplants included in so many games in the first place? Well, why not? It's not an uncommon thing to eat in Japan. And there's a certain amount of cross-pollination, where game developers were influenced by each other's works. Think of how many video games, especially in the '80s-'90s, featured a character who throws bouncing fireballs. That can't all be organic coincidence, right? And in some cases, a game designer would reuse ideas from one project to the next.Are there cultural reasons for using eggplants as a prize? Yes, [the Japanese pronunciation for eggplant](_URL_0_) is a homophone for \"[to accomplish/to build up](_URL_6_),\" making it a fitting punny symbol for something that you collect for points. This play-on-words is not new and [can be seen in Edo Period artwork](_URL_5_), where it was first associated with a fortunate \"first dream of the new year\" (hatsuyume, \u521d\u5922). Eggplants still carry this symbolism today. [Recently the eggplant as a symbol for encouraging success, [has been mostly supplanted by KitKats](_URL_2_), but that is mostly outside the year-limit for this sub, and not exactly the same, so I'll leave it at that.]---Yes, some games did have eggplants as enemies. But again, why not? Wrecking Crew had enemy wrenches, but that is not evidence of any hidden meaning. The choice for enemy eggplants was probably nothing more than a convenient, wacky joke, and in the case of Kid Icarus, that is confirmed by the lead designer. The Mario Bros. series has many references to mushrooms: that you stand on, fight as enemies, eat for power-ups, etc. But these are not signs of cultural critique or expression of any particular mood of the time. Shigeru Miyamoto included them as a doorway to the fantastical setting: > \"Since the game's set in a magical kingdom, I made the required power-up item a mushroom because you see people in folk tales wandering into forests and eating mushrooms all the time,\" he added. \"That, in turn, led to us calling the in-game world the 'Mushroom Kingdom,' and the rest of the basic plot setup sprung from there.\" [[source](_URL_1_)]We will probably never know why all of the NES art directors/developers picked such seemingly random things as eggplants, but in some specific cases, like Kid Icarus, we do: > [Lead designer Toru] Osawa also infused the project with his sense of dark humor... For instance, the Eggplant Wizard was inspired partly by Osawa's \u201cpassion for eggplants,\u201d and the eggplant masks found in Wrecking Crew, but Osawa also says he drew it in celebration of having received his summer bonus. [Note: eggplants are associated with summer.] Needless to say, the rest of the team didn't consider an eggplant-wielding wizard strange at all. In addition, Specknose, the Groucho Marx-glasses monster, was inspired by the large-nosed visage of Hirokazu Tanaka, the game's composer... In another example, Pit can also get a credit card that can be used to buy an item from the Black Marketeer without having to pay full price. However, Pit must work to pay off the debt, with each heart he collects going immediately to the card!

It\u2019s typically accepted by historians that social and gender relations in many parts of Europe at the time were understood through a division between a \u201cpublic\u201d (male) sphere and a \u201cprivate\u201d (predominately female) sphere.  The former encompassed the realms of politics and business, among other things, while the latter encompassed domesticity.  There\u2019s been quite a bit of work both explaining and challenging this theory, so I won\u2019t go into detail on it here.  It suffices to mention that by the late 19th century in Europe, there was a very strong notion among well-to-do individuals that a respectable woman\u2019s place in society was as the \u201cangel of the house\u201d - the moral arbiter of the family within the private space of the home, which served as a respite from the public world.^1The issue with railroad travel was that it represented a situation in which the line between those two spheres became blurry.  Train cars were public spaces in the sense that one was required to share them with strangers, but the intimacy of the environment created a kind of semi-private space.  Concerns arose over both the ways in which women should conduct themselves within these spaces and their potential safety while riding on trains.  We do have sources that show us women could easily travel alone for specific purposes.  Amy Richter\u2019s [_Home on the Rails: Women, the Railroad, and the Rise of Public Domesticity_](_URL_1_) mentions one instance of a woman named Meta Du Pont Coleman who traveled annually between 1879 and 1898 from her home in Louisville, Kentucky to Wilmington, Delaware in order to visit family.  In one letter to her grandmother reassuring of her safety, she writes, \u201cI hope the two postals have reached you, and that you will realize how easy it is to travel alone\u201d (36).  However, we have many, _many_ more representations in magazines and newspapers of manifested fears about women traveling on railroads, particularly when it came to their sexual vulnerability.  [This cartoon](_URL_3_) from _Currier  &  Ives_, entitled \u201cA Kiss in the Dark\u201d (1881), shows an unscrupulous man attempting to steal a kiss from the woman seated behind him when passing through a dark tunnel.^2  One conductor described what he called \u201cThe Magazine Route\u201d - a purported technique of seduction where men would offer a magazine to young women to read on the train and then return later to ask if they had enjoyed it, eventually offering to dine with them in another car (this is quoted in Richter, 39).  Several newspapers and guides warned women against \u201cnomadic flirtations\u201d when traveling alone lest their sexual virtue should be compromised.It\u2019s worth pointing out two things, however.  Firstly, these stories are more indicative of the people who tell and consume them than they are of actual events on trains.  It\u2019s difficult, if not impossible for us to know if there really were cadres of casanovas combing the train cars to seduce unescorted women.  What matters is that people at the time _thought_ there might be, and they acted based on that fear.  Secondly, it\u2019s notable that fears about traveling with strangers weren\u2019t confined to potential dangers for women.  There were fears that travel in a confined, semi-private space with strangers could range from awkward to life-threatening regardless of someone\u2019s gender.  The British satirical rag _Punch_ has a ton of cartoons lampooning the social awkwardness of train travel.  [This one](_URL_5_) from 1856 comically advises passengers that the best way to ensure a car to yourself is to act like you\u2019re traveling with a baby (the logic being, of course, no one wants to travel with a noisy infant), whereas [this one](_URL_4_) from 1866 pokes fun at an upper-class gentleman who refuses to ride in a car with \u201chorrid old women\u201d and \u201cscreaming children.\u201dWolfgang Schivelbusch\u2019s [_The Railway Journey: The Industrialization of Time and Space in the 19th Century_](_URL_6_) is one of the best-known books about cultural attitudes toward European railroad travel, and he has an entire chapter on travel within the compartments themselves.  The book is much more focused on the way in which railroad travel changed people\u2019s perception of space and time, but for the purposes of this question there\u2019s one aspect of that transformation that we should be interested in: the question of whether or not to socialize with strangers.  Most early rail cars in Europe had seating that was arranged like a horse-drawn coach (i.e. you couldn\u2019t switch compartments while the train was moving).  On most long journeys before the railroad, it wasn\u2019t uncommon to get to know your fellow travelers, as you\u2019d be with them for some time.^3  The railroad, according to Schivelbusch, changed that.  One Frenchman was quoted as remarking in 1857: >  In the coach, conversation got off to an easy start after a few moments of preliminary study of one\u2019s companions; at the moment of parting, one oftentimes regretted the brevity of the journey, having almost made friends.  How different it is on the train! (quoted in Schivelbusch, 74).Most people on the train elected _not_ to speak with their neighbors, but this presented a problem: seating was still arranged in the style of a coach, face-to-face to facilitate conversation.  One criticism in an 1838 issue of _Railway Times_ called for a different arrangement to alleviate the problem: >  With reference to the interior arrangement of Railway Carriages\u2026I beg to suggest\u2026to the public, whether their comfort could not be promoted, by having some of them, in each train, fitted up, so that the passengers should sit back to back, and look out upon the country, from a range of windows the whole length of the carriage\u2026surely, this would be pleasanter than a three or four hours\u2019 study of physiognomy at a stretch for want of any better occupation (76).Without redesigning train cars, though, the most common way middle-class people dealt with this problem is by picking up reading material before the journey.  By the late 19th century, reading on the train was a common practice and shops sold materials of all kinds in every train station.^4  [This 1883 cartoon](_URL_0_) from _Punch_ pokes fun at the proliferation of things available for purchase at the station: the cartoon shows the station saturated in advertisements and the text reads, \u201cRailway Puzzle: To find the name of the station.\u201dHowever, there were actually instances where the intimate space of the train car could prove fatal, as a few murders that occurred within train cars became sensationalized in the mid-19th century.  Schivelbusch mentions one in particular printed the _Annales d\u2019Hygi\u00e8ne Publique_ n 1861: the murder of Chief Justice Poinsot on a train from Mulhouse to Paris: >  The ensuing investigation revealed that he had shared his compartment with a single fellow passenger, his murderer.  No trace of the latter was found.  The case aroused unusual interest.  \u201cThe painful interest excited in Paris b the dreadful death of M. Poinsot has been extraordinarily great,\u201d _Galignani\u2019s Messenger_, an English-language newspaper published in Paris, reported on 9 December, \u201cand a certain feeling of uneasiness has arisen at the idea of the extreme facility with which the crime appears to have been perpetrated\u201d (80).The reaction to this story and the idea that one might be sharing a train compartment with a murderer was, again, something that revealed the quirks of this new kind of travel much more than the actual reality, but it was an idea that popped up both in cautionary tales and humorous depictions.^5  [This other cartoon](_URL_2_) from an 1864 issue of _Punch_ advises passengers in tongue-in-cheek fashion to use that idea to their advantage should they want a car to themselves to smoke in.On a final note, many of the things I describe above are going to be class-specific.  Working class people typically didn\u2019t make longer voyages by train (though taking a short holiday was within the means of many working-class families by the early 20th century), and second-class cars were a different kind of travel experience. **TL;DR: Yes, women could and would travel alone by train in the 19th century, but there was a certain uneasiness about train travel in general (and solitary women specifically) due to the values of the time.**", "label": 0}, {"content": "In the late 19th century, women were not allowed to travel alone by train in Europe.

After Scipio took Carthage in 146, he sent a ship to Rome to inform the Senate. Then, according, to Appian:\"The Senate sent ten of the noblest of their own number as deputies to arrange the affairs of Africa in conjunction with Scipio, to the advantage of Rome. They decreed that if anything was still left of Carthage, Scipio should obliterate it and that nobody should be allowed to live there. Direful threats were leveled against any who should disobey and chiefly against the rebuilding of Byrsa or Megara, but it was not forbidden to go upon the ground.\" (135)Thus, although the whole \"salting the land where Carthage had stood\" story is a later embellishment, one might infer that the whole city was leveled. As Appian himself indicates, however, the destruction was not total. The Romans were more worried about preventing anyone from fortifying Carthage than about actually making the site taboo. The Byrsa (Carthage's citadel) and Megara (an especially well-irrigated suburb associated with the Carthaginian elite) could never be reconstructed; but since the territory of Carthage was given to the city of Utica (Appian, *Punic Wars*, 135), it can be safely assumed that local villagers, drawn by the fertility of Carthage's hinterland, would eventually have settled in and around the city.Although Carthage's walls were certainly pulled down, we need not imagine that every building was destroyed. Scipio, for example, actually punished Roman troops who had violated the Temple of \"Apollo\" (or rather his Carthaginian equivalent) - though partly retribution for the fact that those troops had ignored orders while tearing apart the god's golden idol, this might also reflect respect for the sanctuary itself. In addition, Scipio and his men frankly had better things to do than destroy every building. They probably contented themselves with tearing the roofs off the houses.So, while the slopes of the citadel (devastated during the final assault) would have remained a mass of rubble until the Roman re-foundation a century later, a visitor in 129 BCE would probably have found at least the city's outskirts inhabited by local farmers. There is no evidence that the Roman governor, based in Utica, ever stationed troops on the site to ward off settlers.", "label": 0}, {"content": "Carthage was a city in North Africa that was a major trading partner of Rome.

The date of the first edition of the *Malleus* cannot be fixed with absolute certainty, but the likeliest year is 1486. There were, at any rate, fourteen editions between 1487 and 1520, and at least sixteen editions between 1574 and 1669. These were issued from the leading German, French and Italian presses. The latest reprint of the original text of the *Malleus* is to be found in the noble four volume collection of Treatises on Witchcraft, \"sumptibus Claudii Bourgeat\", 4to., Lyons, 1669. There is a German translation by J. W. R. Schmidt, *Der Hexenhammer*, 3 vols, Berlin, 1906; second edition, 1922-3. There is also an English translation with Introduction, Bibliography, and Notes by Montague Summers, published John Rodker, 1928. [...] In fact, \"it fastened on European jurisprudence for nearly three centuries the duty of combating\" the Society of Witches. The *Malleus* lay on the bench of every judge, on the desk of every magistrate. It was the ultimate, irrefutable, unarguable authority. It was implicitly accepted not only by Catholic but by Protestant literature. In fine, it is not too much to say that the *Malleus Maleficarum* is among the most important, wisest, and weightiest books of the world.- Montague Summers, introduction to the [1948 edition](_URL_2_).You have to take Summers with a grain of salt: while extremely erudite in the subject of the occult, the Reverend's actual belief and tendency toward exaltation of occult literature can skew the perception of facts a little. Nevertheless, it does emphasize that the *Malleus* was extraordinarily popular, and for an extensive period of time. A lot of this had to do with utility and demand.If you look at the volumes available to authorities on witchcraft in the period, you have works like Johannes Nider's *Formicarius* (1475); while this was popular and helped define the image and concept of the witch as we know it, this work was not geared toward either a lay audience or legal use since it was quite literally written as a teacher-student dialogue on the lives of ants. The section on witchcraft was actually absorbed into the *Malleus*.And authorities at the period *needed* a work on heresy and witchcraft. Civil courts and authorities were under greater pressure to work with ecclesiastic courts and authorities to address both heresy and *maleficium*, and the framework of Roman Law which was highly influential on the courts of Europe required a certain amount of legalistic wrangling to deal with the contemporary issues of witchcraft. While the Protestant Reformation had not yet occurred, there were still schisms within the church, which inquisitors rooted out as heresy. H. R. Trevor-Roper in [The European Witch-Craze of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries](_URL_0_) writes: >  When the Dominicans pressed for inquisitorial power over witchcraft, the papacy had at first resisted. The old canons of the Church, and particularly the *canon Episcopi*, denied the reality of witches and forbade their persecution. Therefore, in 1257, Pope Alexander IV had refused these demands unless manifest heresy, not merely witchcraft, could be proved. But little by little, under constant pressure, the papacy had yielded.  The great surrender had been made by the French popes of Avignon, and particularly by the two popes from southern France, John XXII and his successor Benedict XII, who had already, as bishops in Languedoc, waged war on nonconformity in the old Albigensian and Vaudois areas. John XXII, who declared heretical the Franciscan doctrine of the poverity of Christ (so dangerously akin to the old Vaudois ideas), also, by his constitution *Super illius specula* of 1325, authorized he full use of inquisitorial procedure against witches, of who he lived in personal terror. For the next century and a half--until the Witch Bull of Innocent VIII, and indeed afterwards--the main effort of the inquisitors (although there were some spectacular 'political' witchcraft trials in France, Burgundy and England) had been directed against the witches of the Alps and the Pyrenees.Summers gives a good run-down of some of the \"political\" witchcraft trials in his introduction to the *Malleus*; sorcery was effectively the civil counterpart to the ecclesiastical charge of heresy, and civil authorities could actually pass mortal sentences, which ecclesiastical courts could not--this was the standard inquisitorial practice, to hand over heretics to secular authorities for further persecution and punishment. This practice applied to all cases before the inquisition, not just the political ones, so as the *scope* of the inquisition expanded to include witchcraft, the need by civil authorities to address the question of witchcraft expanded as well. This brings us to Pope Innocent VIII, who in 1484: >  [...] issued *Summis desiderantes* at the request of two Dominican inquisitors, Heinrich Kramer (or Institoris) and Jacob Sprenger, who had worked in southern Germany and encountered some resistance in their search for heretics. The Bull formally removes all impediments to the completion of Kramer and Sprenger's mission.- Edward Peters, [The Magician, The Witch, and the Law](_URL_1_), 170Peters goes on to note that the Papal bull was not, in itself, remarkable - previous popes had issued bulls with much the same language and for much the same purpose, to authorize members of the clergy and clear away local opposition. However, two years after it was issue, it was included as the preface to the *Malleus Maleficarum* - a text Innocent himself had probably never seen - and in that context, being bundled with the book, gave the book greater authority, beyond even the area of Germany which most concerned the inquisitors. This in part helped its transmission, but the other part is the nature of the book itself. Peters 173-174: >  All scholars agree that the form of the work, that of a series of scholastic *quaestiones*, derives from handbooks for inquisitors, of which Eymeric's is the best example. Within the framework of *quaestiones* arranged into three major parts, owever, the work is intellectually inferior to Eymeric's and hardly to be considered \"scholastic\" in the original sense of that term at all. What is striking about the *Malleus* is its economic use of the *quaestio* form to bring together elements from all of the diverse sources that had provided elements of the new fifteenth-century beliefs in magic in the first place. The juxtaposition of these elements in a single, concentrated, tightly argued treatise of considerably greater length than any earlier work really constituted the basis of the popularity of the *Malleus* during the next two centuries. [...] In no other work are theology and law so tightly linked. Even if, as I have suggested above, the *Malleus* made no discernible impact on the prosecution of magicians and witches for nearly half a century, no comparable work approached its comprehensiveness until those of Bodin and Remy, Del Rio and Boguet, at the end of the sixteenth century.The *Malleus* was not alone in its generation. Writings about witchcraft, even printed works, were extensive, with titles like *Tractatus contra Daemonum Invocatores* (1450) by Jean Vinet, *Fortalicium fidei contra fidei christianae hostes* (1467) by Alfonso de Spina, *Flagellum Maleficorum* (c.1490) by Petrus Mamoris. The *Laienspiegel* (1509) by Ulrich Tengler in particular was incredibly popular, because like the *Malleus* it was a legal work looking at the different aspects of witchcraft in regard to private, public, and criminal law; it went through fourteen editions. But the *Malleus* was uniquely suited to spread, because of its relatively early date, because it was organized in a manner useful to legal authorities, and because the spread of the printing press made it much more accessible to this ready market that was in demand for such a way. Judges and magistrates required a legal text for dealing with the problems posed by accusations of sorcery and heresy, and the *Malleus* was almost encyclopedic compared to other contemporary texts.This, combined with the popularity of the *Malleus* and its relative accessibility also made it something of an authority on witchcraft which many subsequent demonologists would refer to, quote from, or cite as a reference; a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy where a book is popular because it is known to be popular. While there is a popular rumor that it was banned by the Church and placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, I haven't been able to confirm that with any of my sources at hand.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Malleus Maleficarum was the most popular book in Europe for centuries, and was second only to the Bible in sales.

The deciding factors were typically availability of funds, and the notoriety of the person with the bounty on their head.  & #x200B;Django, though one of my favorite movies, plays it a little fast and loose with the history of the West in order to reconcile the events of the plot. Django has to save his wife, who is currently a slave, and bring down an entire plantation, all of which has to take place before the passing of the 13th Amendment in 1865 at the close of the Civil War. Before all of the plantation burning and wife saving, however, Django travels across the American West. The issue with this? The time we associate with the \"lawless\", bounty-hunting, gun-slinging, \"wild\" west started to pick up around 1865. This isn't to say there wasn't bounty hunting taking place before this time, it has been around since before [John Mullowney was hunting down priests](_URL_0_) in the Irish countryside at the end of the 17th century.  & #x200B;The 1860s and ESPECIALLY the 70s saw a shift in vigilante justice and bounties in the way that they relate to the law. At the time almost all western territories were controlled by US marshals, popularly elected sheriffs and constables, local police forces, and \"Indian officers\" (John Ball, *The United States Marshals of New Mexico and Arizona Territories*). Primary accounts of the time collected in Michael Canlis' *The Evolution of Law Enforcement in California* and WC Holden's *Law and Lawlessness in the Texan Frontier* indicate a major public distrust with these officials in the western territories. Compound this distrust with the jails that were both few/far between and inadequately monitored, courts in remote regions, and inadequate financial resources to aid in the chase and capture of fugitives and you end up with a population that is ready to take an active role in maintaining order and protecting their individual interests. The reward system we come to associate with the bounty hunter gunslingers of the west emerges at this time because of the physical and financial capabilities of local law enforcement offices ([Stuart Traub, Rewards, Bounty Hunters, and Criminal Justice in the West 1865-1900](_URL_6_)*).*  & #x200B;Congressional Appropriation Acts initially allocated money for the offering of rewards for the capture of criminals involved in defrauding the government or mail theft. Other acts in the 60s and 70s such as the Postal Service Act of 1867 and the Indian Affairs Act of 1874 included money to pay \"bounties\" (Traub). The government involvement in the funding of reward monies for criminals allowed the acting commissioner of the Treasury to specifically dictate what constituted \"rewardable\" action or information and also made it difficult and time consuming for law enforcement officials in remote areas to receive permission to offer rewards for criminals. This delay resulted in the offering of rewards becoming a more local affair instead of waiting for government clearance to do so.  & #x200B;The offered amount of reward money through the US government varied, but we have documentation of AG Brewster authorizing $100 for a mail robber in 1882 (BH Brewster to JL Tidball October 1882 Justice Department Letters Received), [US Marshall CP Drake offering $500 for a group of stage robbers in 1878](_URL_1_), among many others for those patient enough to scour letters from the Justice Department or newspapers of the time. For further context, the Vernon County Court in Missouri during the 1870s offered up $250 for the capture of any murderer or horse thief (US Work Projects Admin - Historical Records Survey Missouri). These rewards become substantially larger for the capture of more well known criminals and outlaws, and business organizations, understandably upset that their stagecoaches were being robbed and nothing was being done about it, began to offer their own rewards that were much higher than federal or local government rewards (Allan Levett, *The Centralization of City Police in the 19th Century*). The Missouri, Kansas, and Texas railroads offered $5000 for each member of the Dalton gang (Glenn Shirley, *Six Gun and Silver Star*). The analysis of various wanted posters from the 1860s to the 1910s (when the Wild West pretty much ended as we know it), indicates that there were a lot of heavy bounties floating around for better known criminals. [$10,000 for Boss Tweed](_URL_4_), [$5,000 for N Appleton Shute](_URL_3_), $5,000 for Billy the Kid, $5,000 for Bill Doolin, $25,000 for Jesse James, etc etc.  & #x200B;Considering the notoriety of some of the outlaws of Django Unchained, i.e. the Brittle brothers, it is reasonable for $1,000+ rewards to be offered, but for 1858 considering all of the bigger rewards weren't government funded and privately funded bounties were only starting to be offered in the 1860s.  & #x200B;To answer your second question, \"Do we have records of specific criminals and their bounties?\" - no. And also yes. It's difficult to track down any typical \"record\" of bounties. There isn't a leger with a tidy list of criminals and how much the average joe with a rifle and a set of steel balls could make if he brought him in. What we do have is letters, often between US Marshals and the Attorney General granting permission to use federal funds for criminal rewards, WANTED posters, and newspapers. Lots and lots of newspapers. The average person could put out a newspaper ad offering $100 to anyone who can bring their house burglar to justice or return their latest runaway slave. A bank could put out a newspaper ad offering $10,000 for a group of men that robbed them. Newspapers from the 19th century are PACKED with rewards for anyone with information regarding various criminal wrongdoings. Posters and fliers advertising rewards for outlaws are widely available on the internet. So in a sense, yes, we have records.  & #x200B;For further reading I would suggest scouring the Library of Congress Archives, the Nova Scotia archives, papers sourced/linked above, and the Western Historical Quarterly (yes, its a real quarterly). The book *Wives, Slaves, and Servant Girls* is a great resource for more reward ads from the last quarter of the 18th Century.

I'll do my best to answer, though, primarily using one of my books on American history (specifically pre-Civil War), a journal article, and two dissertations I've read on the subject.**The Bible Belt, for those who are unaware or unclear on it, is a region in the United States South, which is often referenced but not clarified specifically with boundaries. The common consensus is that the phrase was coined in 1920 by H.L. Mencken, \"...to designate those parts of the country in which the literal accuracy of the Bible is credited and clergymen who preach it have public influence.\" The name stuck, primarily because it seemed fairly accurate to all who saw it. Mencken never gave a specific location, though: Stephen W. Tweedie argues in \"Viewing the Bible Belt\" what he believes the boundaries to be, and they roughly conform to [this map](_URL_0_).How it came to be is still a question in and of itself, now that we've attempted to define this very vague region (many journal articles don't even define it, despite talking about features it contains: that's how vague it really is). Generally, it has its roots to some degree in the lifestyle held by Southerners even before the Civil War. The rural lifestyle, greater focus on honor, and different culture in the South when compared to the North helped create an area ripe for religious influence and living. Talking about the growth of evangelicalism in the United States in the early 1800s, David Henkin notes in *Becoming America* that: > The spread of religious enthusiasm in rural America was not confined to a single denomination. Baptist communities, which were less centrally organized than their Methodist counterparts, flourished in many of the same rural areas...\"However they were organized or defined, American evangelical communities tended to emphasize broad themes of conversion and rebirth rather than finer points of theological doctrine. The spread of this kind of evangelical Christianity initiated a pattern in American religious life that remains visible today. The part of the country frequently referred to as the Bible Belt is the area that was influenced most powerfully by evangelical campaigns in the first quarter of the nineteenth century. This development was not the result of the cultural isolation of southern communities, but rather the opposite: Evangelicals in the South and the trans-Appalachian West were connected to growing networks of religious preaching and communication.This growing religious movement would translate into a larger and larger religious fervor in the South which would eventually come to be associated with the area we know as the Bible Belt. When the onslaughts of modernity hit around the early 1900s, the churches of the South were invigorated once again. Joseph Locke, in \"Making the Bible Belt\", notes that: > Although evangelical Texans protested the onslaughts of modernity, and declared in a great chorus voice their weakness and vulnerability, their confrontations with the modern world only bolstered their political and cultural power. To put it another way, they prospered because of, and not in spite of, their confrontation with the modern world.To drive this point home, the feeling of a fight against the \"corrupted\" modern society of the time was clear. People now felt that religion and \"God's Kingdom\" as a whole was under attack, beleaguered, and only increased participation in the Church and in religious activities could revitalize morality in the world. Clergymen also took the opportunity to promote themselves as the fighters against immorality and corruption: as society's saviors. Things like liquor, now viewed as immoral, were fought as well by the Church. \"'In fighting the liquor traffic,' J. B. Cranfill wrote in 1916, 'I have learned what it means to combat the most gigantic and soul-less corrupting agency this land has ever known.'\"As many have documented, there is a \"rally-round-the-flag\" effect. The feeling that Southern religion was under attack, as I've noted already, played a big part in bringing about the Bible Belt and increasing focus on it. New clerical champions, so to speak, paved the way for a revival of religion in the despairing religious communities of the late 19th century, which had effectively lost their way. They picked up on the paths blazed by the circuit riders through rural communities (not literally, metaphorically they picked up on them) and reinspired the populace to follow. This was easier in the less-industrial (and thus less-modernized, by many accounts) South, which had always placed a greater focus on religion anyways. Again, an example of this feeling of monumental struggle: > \"A crisis in the history of our country is certainly upon us,\" B.H. Carroll freely admitted, but he asked \"How shall we meet it? The opportunity of a lifetime is before us. How shall we use it?\"Clericalism helped \"save\" the South from the corruption of the modern world, and that helped Southerners take more active positions in the clergy. The spiritual pallor was realized and fought, rather than succumbed to, when the Church realized it had a crop of young, new leadership who could, in fiery passion, whip up the populace. The cause of fighting for Prohibition would help: the long-standing belief of honor in self-restraint that had been prominent in Southern society (think anti-masturbatory campaigns in pre-Civil War America, the teetotallers and prohibitionists, etc.) would serve to once more be inflamed and inspired through the giving of purpose, a purpose against liquor that would help move the entire religious movement as well. Baptist preacher Sumner Calloway effectively argued that \"...if the church 'clothe[d] herself with zeal,' it would be saved\".Eventually, the religious zeal would be self-perpetuating, as academics even in the South would write of the religious fervor of their region. It built on itself, and it inserted itself into many, many aspects of Southern society. The South began to be viewed as fundamentalist, especially due to lower education rates, as literacy was poorer in the South around the early 1900s by far. > In 1914, Walter A. Dyer, writing in the World\u2019s Work, claimed that the 1910 census \u201cshowed that in North Carolina alone there were 122,189 grown white people who could neither read nor write.As mentioned in \"Building the Bible Belt\" by Mary Matthews: > Almost as soon as the journalistic accounts of the fundamentalists turned from unbiased to negative, the reporters, columnists, and editors equated the South with fundamentalism. The success of the anti-evolution campaign in the South only served to reinforce this already extant belief, and the Scopes Trial in 1925 was merely another example to non-Southem observers that the region was a natural home for fundamentalism. The location of fundamentalism in the South allowed proponents of modernism to contain a religious threat within a single area o f the country, and it allowed them to explain how such a movement could have arisen. It also led opponents of fundamentalism to believe, wrongly, that the movement was a passing phase which education could ameliorate.This is a condensed version of the growth of fundamentalism, and the belief that the South was fundamentalist, that led to the term \"Bible Belt\". The roots can be traced back very far, as with most things, but this is effectively a crash course in the subject that I hope can help you understand how the early focus on religion which persisted left the South ripe for religious awakening. When, in the North, there was a fear that morality was being foregone, it didn't turn to the Church nearly as much because the Church never figured as prominently into Northern life. The South had always been more religious, circuit riders and prominent use of religious spread among rural communities by evangelicals, and the turning to the Church when there was fear of moral corruption in the South made it perfect for the \"Bible Belt\" name, and it lived up to it to a fairly obvious degree by most accounts.**Sources:**Henkin, David M.

On July 28 Secretary of State Seward signed a requisition for a warrant, #4217, for $7.2 million in gold from the Treasury Department. On July 29, L. L. Smith, the first auditor of the treasury, established an account, #165,615, and signed a report approving the payment of $7.2 million to the Emperor of Russia and sent it to the comptroller of the treasury. The comptroller and the register of the Treasury Department, the government's chief bookkeeping official, then certified the report. The register of the treasury wrote an order on the U.S. treasurer, an appropriation warrant. The treasurer, in turn, authorized the transfer of the funds to a departmental disbursing agent, who was accountable for the proper use of the money. On August 1 the agent wrote a draft in that amount, a pay warrant, payable to Edward de Stoeckl. Stoeckl endorsed the draft over to Riggs Bank with instructions to Riggs to pay the money to Russia's bank for foreign accounts, the London office of Baring Brothers and Company. Riggs, who charged a fee of $3,600 for his services, sent only $7,035,000 to the Baring office in New York. Stoeckl authorized Riggs to pay Robert J. Walker $26,000 in gold for his lobbying services.The swirl around the basic mechanics of payment get interesting.  First, there were a lot of accusations of corruption associated with the deal involving the $139,000 left over from the money sent to Russia and the money paid to the main lobbyist.  As the Archives article notes, a Congressional investigation came to no strong conclusions, but there is some evidence at the time that money was paid to member of Congress. Ronald J. Jenson, author of The Alaska Purchase and Russian American Relations (1975), concluded that $100,000 was disbursed to members and another $10,000 was supposed to go to Thaddeus Stevens, but he died first.There is also a persistent Russian conspiracy theory that [Russia never received payment.](_URL_0_) The gist is that the ship carrying the gold from London sank, with variants of the story adding an air of conspiracy and theft with claims no gold was found in the wreck, or that a former Confederate saboteur was somehow involved.I couldn\u2019t find any formal English-language research on it, but someone [here](_URL_4_) found a Russian journal article by a historian who found evidence in the Russian archives.

Monarchs, nobles, his own peers and the general public could agree on this, though some circles revered him more than others. As a child he toured Europe with his father Leopold, and his sister, Nannerl (who was herself a prodigy). Leopold in fact orchestrated much of Mozart and his sister\u2019s success and recognition through advertising. A newspaper in Augsburg, Germany, boasted of the eleven year old Nannerl\u2019s talents, and went on to describe Mozart: > But we are transported with utter amazement when we see a boy of six years sitting at a harpsichord, and hear him not only playing the same sonatas, trios and concertos manfully, not at all like a child, but also hear him improvising from his head ...

He performed in front of a few influential figures, including Melchior Grimm, who was a leading journalist and art critic of the time. Grimm was astounded by Mozart\u2019s capabilities, and published a notice in the Correspondance litt\u00e9raire, which essentially praised little Wolfgang as a genius, and urged others to hear him play. He concluded his notice by warning Parisians that the musical family was to \u201cproceed from here to England, and then back home by way of North Germany.\u201dMozart put on a few concerts in Paris, to which mostly the nobility attended. Leopold was growing agitated because while his son *was* performing, it was not at the request of the nobles *themselves.* He figured that in order for the nobility to invite the Mozarts to their houses, they needed the recognition and approval of the monarchy.The family ended up travelling to Versailles for a few days, hoping for some recognition. On January 1st, 1764, they received the Royal summons, and after a public court dinner, Mozart played the organ in front of King Louis XV. He was met with applause \u2014 the royal seal of approval that the family needed. This opened many doors for the family, as now nobles were inviting them to play in their houses.When they arrived in London, it only took a few days for King George III and Queen Charlotte to invite Mozart to their own royal court to perform. He played the king\u2019s favourite works and went on to meet London\u2019s court composer, Johann Christian Bach! As you can see, he was most definitely recognized as a genius at this time, and had the approval of royals, nobles, and composers alike. I\u2019ll leave Mozart\u2019s childhood alone and instead turn to his career as an adult. By the time he reached the age of 16, the concept of being a \u201cchild prodigy\u201d was beginning to wear off, and he was starting to arouse jealousy and opposition. He found himself back home in Salzburg, where he was met with bad news: his main patron, the Archbishop of Salzburg, von Schrattenbach, had died. A rather stern and haughty man, Count von Colloredo, was now in charge, and he was not a huge fan of music. Nevertheless, Mozart wrote works for the Salzburg Cathedral and the Count made sure to pay him. (Mozart would make around one hundred and fifty gulden).From 1772-1777 the Mozarts stayed in Salzburg and Wolfgang worked as a Konzertmeister at a salary of 150 fl. He composed lots, put on performances, and maintained a busy social calendar. But Salzburg offered no real opportunity for fame. Wolfgang was getting frustrated, and wanted change. Funnily enough, in 1776 he wrote to Padre Martini (an Italian musician) \u201cI live in a country where music leads to a struggling existence.\u201dThe years 1778-1780 were certainly a low for Mozart. He travelled to Paris again, hoping to find some work, but nothing seemed to be going right. While everyone loved his music, no one was offering him a permanent post. It was around this time that his mother died, as well. So Wolfgang returned to Austria, and stayed in Vienna with the Archbishop. He hoped to find solid ground here, and was actually beginning to receive commissions. When the Archbishop announced that it was time to leave Vienna, Mozart protested as he was determined to stay and make some cash. His stubbornness earned him a literal kick in the butt, and he was propelled out of the palace, earning him considerable censure in Viennese society. (Mozart did not care, for he was free from the employment of the Archbishop, and could now carve out his own destiny in Vienna).Things changed in 1782 when he married Constanze Weber. Leopold was pretty upset about this, he thought his son should at least have a salaried position before he got married. Nevertheless, the newlyweds set up house on their own and Wolfgang was for once in his life independent from his father.The remaining ten years of his life were exciting. Joseph II took over as emperor, and (luckily for Mozart) he loved music, especially Italian music. Joseph housed an Italian opera company in his palace, meaning dozens of Italian musicians and composers flocked to Vienna. They hated Mozart, and were jealous of his musical capabilities. This feud continued for the rest of his life, and was led by a court musician by the name of ... Salieri! In the face of opposition, Mozart debuted operas, taught pupils, and received a number of commissions. Things were going pretty well for him. His father visited him in 1785, and he believed his son was well-off. He had a billiard table, he held dances at home, and enjoyed meals of meat, oysters, champagne and coffee.Did this mean he was wealthy? Well, his financial situation remains a bit foggy. For an opera, the composer would be paid a single fee of ~400 florins. Since there was no copyright, Mozart received nothing for the copies made by the theatre copyist. He also did not receive money from further performances. Since he was freelancing during this time, most money came from pupils and commissions.Anyway, during this time Mozart was writing some of his most famous operas: the Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni, and Cosi fan tutte. The librettist for these works was Lorenzo da Ponte, the official theatre poet of Joseph II. Oddly enough, when Figaro was first performed in Vienna in 1786, it wasn\u2019t received very well. One aristocrat even described it as \u201cboring.\u201d Prague happened to be the first city that recognized Mozart\u2019s operatic genius. In 1783 the people of Prague fell in love with the Abduction from the Seraglio, and when Figaro premiered, the theatre was packed out. People even threw poems down from the gallery on to the stage in praise of the work. Mozart\u2019s search for a permanent post came to fruition in 1787 when Joseph appointed him as a Court Chamber Composer. This was a breakthrough after more than six years of freelance work. The money, however, was not enough to live on, especially given his lavish lifestyle. (When his father had died some months prior, Mozart was sent 1,000 florins, all of which likely went to creditors).He became desperate for funds in 1789. Joseph II, his main patron, died. The theatres closed in his honour, meaning Mozart\u2018s financial situation was in peril. He wrote to friends for money. In a letter to Michael Puchberg, Mozart wrote \u201cinstead of paying my debts I am asking for more money!\u201d among other entreaties. During 1790, the coronation of Leopold II as Holy Roman Emperor took place. Fifteen musicians from Vienna were chosen to go, Salieri being one of them. Mozart was not chosen, but this did not stop him from going. He pawned his silver and used the money to buy a carriage, which got him to the coronation. This speaks of his impulsive spending habits. By 1791, Mozart\u2019s health declined and he died. It was custom to have no elaborate ceremonies at that time in Vienna. Many people wept outside his house when they learned of his death, and at the actual funeral a handful of family and friends attended (among them Salieri).Was he seen as a genius? Yes, as I have showcased. As a child it was apparent, the royals and nobles loved him. Journalists such as Grimm praised him. By the time he became a teenager and adult, the wonder wore off. Jealousy and opposition came about. He worked as a freelance musician for most of his life. This did not mean people looked down on him, or saw him as anything less than one of the greatest musicians of their time. Haydn, a great admirer of Mozart, once said \u201cposterity will not see such a talent as his for the next hundred years.\u201d He was right.As to his fame after death? Much can be owed to Constanze. She promoted memorial and benefit concerts mere weeks after her husband\u2019s death. She tried to launch her son, Franz Xaver, as a prodigy. She even sold some of Mozart\u2019s compositions for 3,600 fl to the king of Prussia. By the 1820s, two thirds of Mozart\u2019s works were in print. She, unlike her late husband, found financial stability and even ended up remarrying. While Amadeus is a fun film, it is always important to view such movies through a skeptical lens.

I work at an architecture firm, so I can give some insight but I've never worked on a stadium.

The last great examples in my city, Chicago, are the [Monadnock Building](_URL_1_) and the [Auditorium Theater](_URL_4_) (bonus trivia, this is where Frank Llyod Wright started practicing architecture under Louis Sullivan).The reason almost no one builds this way anymore is that it requires a lot of labor and as a very rough rule of thumb labor makes up about 2/3's of the cost of a building project (applies in US anyways, in China it's 1/3 labor 2/3 material).

The height of the outer wall is 48 meters (157 ft / 165 Roman feet). The perimeter originally measured 545 meters (1,788 ft / 1,835 Roman feet). The central arena is an oval 87 m (287 ft) long and 55 m (180 ft) wide, surrounded by a wall 5 m (15 ft) high, above which rose tiers of seating.That gives you an area of about 246,340 SF or 22,900 m^2 . This completely ignores the fact that the actual area is not two dimensional (multi-story). I can't find a resource to provide this info which is definitely a limitation of this answer.I'm taking the area:cost ratio for recently constructed stadiums from this article in [The Atlantic](_URL_2_). I made a [quick spreadsheet](_URL_3_) to come up with a cost of $473/SF or about $5,100/m^2.246,340 SF x $473 = ~$166,500,000Again, this ignores the fact that the area is much larger than this. The Colosseum held 50,000 people which is about the size of a modern baseball park in the US. The ranges in the spreadsheet go from about 1 million to 1.3 million SF (about 93,000 - 120,000 m^2). This would give us:Low1,000,000 SF x $473 = ~$473,000,000High1,300,000 SF x $473 = ~$615,000,000So $500-600 million plus a huge premium for the fact that it's load bearing masonry.

The short version is yes, naumachiae were very much a thing (Caesar held the first one during his triumph in 46). But amphitheaters were rarely flooded. Naumachiae generally took place in man-made basins--Caesar built a giant temporary basin in the Campus Martius that was filled when the games were over, and Augustus built a huge one near the Tiber island that was still in use when Titus staged games there as part of the dedication for the Flavian Amphitheater, also known as the Colosseum. The largest naumachiae ever were Claudius', staged in the Fucine Lake before he drained it. As far as amphitheaters go, they were too small to stage anything but the smallest naumachiae--these were spectacles that needed huge amounts of room (Augustus' naumachiae featured thirty triremes and biremes, as well as multiple small vessels and thousands of rowers and marines). Until the Colosseum was built permanent amphitheaters didn't really exist in the city, which made it all the more difficult to stage them in anything but a basin. The first naumachiae in an amphitheater that I know of are Nero's, which he held in a wooden amphitheater built on the Campus Martius--the amphitheater was drained afterward and regular combats held afterward, until the amphitheater was torn down at the end of thr games. Suetonius claims that it was filled with seawater, which is not in any of our other sources--I'm more than a bit skeptical of that, since apart from the difficulties of bringing so much seawater, the location of the theater on the Campus Martius suggests that, like Caesar, Nero just filled it by connecting it to the Tiber (and we know that it was connected somehow, because he drained it into the Tiber). Titus held small naumachiae in the Colosseum during its dedication ceremony, but the big ones were held at Augustus' basin, where he set up a false floor and held simultaneous land and sea battles. As I recall the only time that we know of when the Colosseum was used to stage naumachiae other than this is briefly under Domitian, during the dedication of his amphitheater", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Romans were known for their love of spectacle, and the amphitheatre was one of their most famous spectacles.

In 1954, the CIA waged a campaign of psychological warfare through radio, leafleting, and political postering on the Guatemalan people in order to scare the army into staging a coup.  The attempt was successful, despite the fact that the actual land forces of CIA-backed Castillo Armas were small and barring a miracle, would have been defeated by the forces of the Guatemalan government at the time.Some background: in 1944, the dictator of Guatemala, Jorge Ubico, was overthrown after a decade and a half of rule, and replaced by Guatemala's first democracy.  Guatemala's second president, Jacobo Arbenz, initiated a campaign of land reform known as Decree 900 to take and redistribute a portion of the unused land of the United Fruit Company.  At this time, the UFC owned 70% of arable land in Guatemala, its only port, and its only railroad.  The plan was to give the appropriated land to poor peasants in order to create a basis for economic growth in Guatemala.  Under Ubico, the UFC had been paying property taxes based on an undervaluation of their property.  Arbenz's government would have compensated the UFC at this valuation.  The UFC was predictably not happy with this and initiated a campaign with the US government to overthrow Arbenz, on the basis that it was increasing the Communist foothold in South America.  The Arbenz government had interacted with the USSR but was not reliant on them and did not align with them.  Numerous times they stated that this redistributive policy was only intended to create a basis for capitalist development in their nation.From Foreign Minister Guillermo Toriello at the Inter-American Conference:\"The delegation of Guatemala is here, its head high, to express the legitimate aspirations of our people and the Revolutionary Government, solidly united in the desire and the effort to achieve an effective political and economic freedom, through the exercise of democracy, absolute respect for the political and social rights of man, and the development of an economic program in accordance with the present and future needs of the nation.\"_URL_0_The whole document is worth checking out.  In campaigning the government, the UFC hired publicist Edward Bernays to use his connections in US media to paint a picture of Guatemala as fostering communist development.  The Dulles family had close connections to the UFC, being large shareholders in the company, while one was Secretary of Defense* (John Foster Dulles) and the other (Allen Dulles) director of the CIA.  They participated in lobbying the government to do something about Jacobo Arbenz.The CIA threw their weight behind Castillo Armas, and initiated their plan of psychological warfare.  Armas invaded with CIA assistance in 1954, with only a force of 480 men.  They invaded in such a way as to create the impression among the populace of insurmountable odds for the Guatemalan military.  Throughout this invasion, the CIA-sponsored radio station Voice of Liberation broadcast news of a popular right-wing insurgency and the inevitable collapse of the Arbenz government.  They dropped leaflets and spread rumors of the inevitable collapse of the Arbenz government, as well as using military force to create the illusion of an imminent invasion.  To make a much longer story short, this struck fear into the hearts of the officer corps of the Guatemalan Army, and Arbenz decided that this made his continued existence as president untenable.  He resigned in June 1954, and was replaced by the dictator Castillo Armas, who repealed Decree 900 and protected the landholdings of the United Fruit Company.Source: much of this information came from *Bitter Fruit: The Story of the American Coup in Guatemala* by Stephen Kinzer and Stephen Schlesinger.I am very open to alternate viewpoints or any challenge to the information I've provided here.Edit: typo and grammar*Edit2:  /u/Youarenotagangster pointed out that John Foster Dulles was the Secretary of State, not the Secretary of Defense.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The use of propaganda leaflets in World War II was a major factor in the defeat of Germany.

Chinese sources (The Chronicle of Wei) talk about interaction with the Kingdom of Wa (a somewhat derogatory term meaning \"Kingdom of Dwarves\"), which ranges anywhere from around the 200 BCE to 100 CE depending how one interprets the Chinese dating system. Japan of this time had been in contact with the mainland for hundreds of years, and imported many experts to assist with rice growing and irrigation techniques. Also present were scribes, but who almost exclusively wrote in Chinese. Until about the 6th century CE, the Japanese did not generally use Chinese characters for the purpose of government or personal writing. It's not until widespread adoption of Buddhism and the adoption of the Taika reforms that extensive record keeping, especially histories and government business, begins to occur with any regularity or in an official manner. So while there existed, and may still exist, documents which describe Himiko from a contemporary Japanese perspective, these would not be any sort of official history or go beyond a personal diary or letter.As part of creating a legitimacy for his new government under the Taika reforms, and to further mimic a Tang Chinese style of government, Prince Shotoku commissioned the writing of the Nihon Shoki as a dynastic history of his Yamato family line. This history is the primary place in which the family connection between the Emperor and the Sun Goddess is codified, the various mythos of the creation of the Kami and the islands of Japan are collected, and is essentially the earliest document available that describes any time prior to the 6th century from a Japanese perspective. The document is also concerned with the succession of the Emperor from Amaterasu, and places the first \"grandson\" of Amaterasu as Emperor Jimmu. Jimmu, or at least the man we think was Jimmu, probably lived around 350 CE, around 200 years after Himiko would have lived. To further complicate things, the Nihon Shoki was not translated from Tang dynasty Chinese into Japanese until the 18th century by a man named Norinaga. His translation of the Nihon Shoki is arguably the ultimate work on the subject. Yet, it is still a translation, and possibly contains errors or interpretations of the translator. This is to say, after all this ramble, that there is no reliable source for early Japanese history. Documents like the Chronicles of Wei are the only insight aside from archeological evidence at early Japanese culture and life. The Nihon Shoki is first and foremost a dynastic history, and is designed to aggrandize the Yamato. The most important way this is done is through Amaterasu and the connection the Kami. This connection to the Sun Goddess is congruent with the centralization of authority around the High Priestess mentioned in the chronicles and the evolution of Japan's political structure from the Yayoi period into the early Heian.Within the social structure of early Japan, clan was the most important distinction between various groups. These clans tended to be collected around a professional class or a social function, and split between Uji clans (mostly aristocratic, military, and priestly families) and Be (professional classes, such as blacksmiths, potters, weavers etc.) Most Be were not as formally organized as Uji. At the head of each clan would be an Uji-gami, or a family diety/spirit (Uji - Clan, Gami = Kami) whose worship would be directed by the head of the family. This is where Himiko as a \"Sun Princess\" is important. If Himiko's family was large and powerful, and worshiped the embodiment of Amaterasu, clans who were subservient to them (either for social, religious, or military reasons) would gain status through their association with Himiko's Uji-Gami. This transmission of power, from God, to Emperor/High Priestess, to vassal Clan is the foundation for all political legitimacy in Japan until the end of WW2, and even after the Emperor was stripped of his Godhood he was placed as a quasi-religious symbol of Japan's \"Unity\" in the first line of the post-war constitution. This is how important this sense of continuance from Japan's mythical roots is even today. Another thing to consider was the purpose of some of the Taika Reforms that accompanied this effort to legitimize this new style of government. The reforms introduced standardized taxation, the mustering of armed forces, and a re-organziation of the government to an extremely bureaucratic level. But some of the most important reforms are those around how titles are appointed, what titles now existed, and the methods of bestowing titles and badges of office. We can assume from the detail and specificity of this part of the decrees that the ability for any major family to assign themselves title was a becoming problematic. Association with Himiko may have introduced uncertainty into the new order, but this is admittedly speculation. However, there may be something to be said about the events that led up to the reforms themselves. Without getting too deep into it, the introduction of Buddhism and other benefits of the Tang (literacy and bureaucracy especially) had been met by significant resistance by the entrenched priest class Clans, who felt that Buddhism was an attack on their Shinto values, the Gods, and the land itself (which is all sort of the same thing?). The synthesis between Buddhist and Shinto practice is in part a result of the political negotiation and conflict of this period.What does this mean for Himiko? It's possible she was omitted because making mention of the previous system political legitimacy may not have been good politics. It's possible she was forgotten, since she likely lived around 400-500 hundred years before the Nihon Shoki was written. I've even heard some discussion in a seminar I attended that posited Himiko (or at least SOME High Priestess) has been conflated with Amaterasu in the Nihon Shoki as Jimmu's relative. This is an interesting theory, but regrettably has no real way of being proven. It's even possible in this new patriarchal Confucian society that Shotoku was trying to build it would be unacceptable to pay deference to a Queen (though it is known he adored his mother, the Empress Suiko, this doesn't always translate elsewhere). **TLDR: The most likely reason is that by the time any one bothered to write anything down, Himiko was no longer relevant to who they thought was important.**EDIT: It has been pointed out quite correctly that I have forgotten that Himiko is mentioned a few times in the Nihon Shoki and is possibly conflated with the Empress Jingu. My specialty is in the re-opening of the country period through to WW2, so I apologize if I led anyone astray. However, I believe my point still stands that Himiko isn't really understood by those writing the Nihon Shoki and was not likely relevant to their goals when writing it.EDIT: Thank you for the Gold! I will use it as inspiration to finally do a write up about the crazy 1860s and the Shinsengumi.

I've written about it several times, you can read about Venice's early Economic development in a rambling answer [here](_URL_0_), Venetian conflict resolution in an equally rambling answer [here](_URL_2_), and a description of the Republic at its height [here](_URL_3_). There's also [this other answer of mine](_URL_1_) examining geographic, political, and social determinants of Venice's success with long-winded and detailed examples.There are two sides to the Venetian lagoon's impact on Venice's success of a polity. The first, and most evident, is the fact that the community was fundamentally unassailable until the development of long-range gunpowder artillery. Even when, as in the wars of the thirteenth century, Genoese ships were able to break into the southern end of the lagoon, these warships would only run aground in the shallow waters. Similarly, time and time again landward assailants would find themselves with little to do but shake their fists at the Venetians from the shore. It is the lagoon, and the seafaring customs it begat, which kept the Venetians more connected to the wealthy Empire of Constantinople in the east than the turbulent Empire of Charlemagne in the west. Over the course of bitter struggles with the nearby communities of Grado, Padua, and Verona, the lagoon also gave the Venetians another advantage: Northern Italy's inland waterways reach the sea in or near the Venetian lagoon, laying the foundation for Venice's commercial domination over those waterways, which would then morph into political control as confrontations with neighbors were invariably concluded in Venice's favor. No other Italian city had the advantage of multiple routes into Italy and Central Europe. Genoa, while able to extend its domination on minor cities and towns of the Ligurian coast (that is to say, places to which it had a maritime connection) had no comparable advantageous connection to the Italian interior and thus more difficult connections to the nodes where goods had to be unloaded from rivers to cross the Alps (although the Genoese, conscious of this, compensated by expanding their commercial interests in Europe through other nodes like Marseilles and Seville). Pisa too, while at the mouth of the River Arno, had only one upriver neighbor (Florence) which which it developed a contentious relationship, as well as no natural conduit to carry goods into central and western Europe.The second advantage intrinsic to the lagoon is somewhat more nuanced. The nebulous notion of the \"Lagoon as Polity\" with which Venetians defined their early political organization is as is difficult to understate as it is difficult to put into words. With the Rialtine Islands on which the modern city of Venice stands only recognizably developed in the eleventh century, Venice's early political organization was formed with the goal in mind to bring stable government to the various communities on the lagoon's islands. This meant that in addition to being the middlemen between trade of goods between eastern and western mediterranean, Venice also possessed an internal economy characterized by stable trade between low-density lagoon communities. Further, this also meant that the Venetian political organization was set up to balance the needs of a geographically diverse set of communities with different political preferences and goals. While the Venetian system would morph into an aristocratic oligarchy, the early checks and balances put in place allowed for stable system of government that while grossly imperfect, was much more inclusive than that of its neighbors and would come to govern the whole of Northeast Italy very successfully.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Republic of Venice was so much more powerful and influential compared to other Italian republics based around port cities (Genoa, Pisa) because it had a much larger territory and a much larger population.

It also saw the Harlem Renaissance and the Great Migration; the foundation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (1909) of which Lovecraft's friend James F.

Segregation was legal; mixed-race marriages often outlawed.Millions of immigrants came into the United States from all over the world; they were greeted with nativism and xenophobia, and Congress took action, passing the Immigration Act of 1924 to restrict immigration on a racial basis through the use of a quota system.

We had this much \"Hitlerism\" before we had ever heard of Handsome Adolf.- H. P. Lovecraft to J. Vernon Shea, 25 Sep 1933, *Letters to J. Vernon Shea* 157The rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party to pre-eminence in Germany in 1933 marked a watershed moment; the unequivocal antisemitic policies of the Nazis were decried even by Lovecraft, but antisemitism was also prevalent in the United States.That can be taken as background: Lovecraft not a member of the KKK or a Nazi, although he had some sympathy for Hitler's nationalistic ethos. Lovecraft was an antisemite and nativist who married a woman that was an ethnically Jewish Russian immigrant, and had several Jewish friends; this apparent hypocrisy was reasoned away by making exceptions and citing the prevailing policy of \"assimilationism\" with regard to immigrants. He was certainly a racist and a white supremacist, in a time when racism was commonplace, and white supremacy often enforced by law.He didn't have to be. >  I hardly wonder that my racial ideas seem bigoted to one born  &  reared in the vicinity of cosmopolitan New York, but you may better understand my repulsion to the Jew when I tell you that until I was fourteen years old I do not believe I ever spoke to one or saw one knowingly.- H. P. Lovecraft to Rheinhart Kleiner, 6 Dec 1915, *Letters to Rheinhart Kleiner* 27-28It's not an exaggeration to say that Lovecraft's early life was sheltered. He did not attend school regularly, and never graduated high school due to illness; never had the opportunity to go to college, never really worked what could be considered a normal job. Lovecraft was not quite the recluse that he sometimes painted himself as in his letters, but until his 20s he really didn't get out and see much of the world. From his own accounts, he had absorbed his various prejudices regarding race and ethnicity fairly early and didn't really meet anyone or anything to challenge those views until he was in his mid-20s, when he joined the national amateur journalism movement - something that got him out of the house and in contact with people from many different walks of life.Travel, correspondence, broader reading, and world events all expanded Lovecraft's horizons and tempered some of his views - his initial antisemitism, for example, was relieved in part by congenial meetings with Jewish friends like Samuel Loveman, his future wife Sonia Haft Greene, and later young writers like Robert Bloch, Kenneth Sterling, and Julius Schwartz. Lovecraft's anti-Irish phase largely diminished after Irish independence was achieved in 1921, and dwindled after he began corresponding with Robert E. Howard, who identified as Irish-American.But he was never what you would call *not racist*. I discuss this a bit further in my answer to the thread [I have heard that H. P. Lovecraft came to regret his racist views later in his life. Is this true?](_URL_0_) Within the milieu of 1890-1937, pretty much all of Lovecraft's prejudices were common, if not mainstream. His fiction during the period, which was mostly published in *Weird Tales*, is not remarkable compared to the various Yellow Peril serials, zombie tales, and sometimes more blatantly racist fare that was standard in the pulps; Lovecraft was never censured for that, although he also seldom went out of his way to include a racial stereotype, and rarely used racist epithets in his fiction - those were resolved for his private letters, never intended for publication.Among his correspondents and friends, Lovecraft was certainly the more conservative and prejudiced compared more liberal folks like Jame F. Morton (mentioned above, he issued a pamphlet about *The Curse of Race Prejudice* in 1906), Robert Bloch, J. Vernon Shea, and others, especially those that were more cosmopolitan than Lovecraft, and it is really Lovecraft's long letters to them arguing or stating his positions which give us most of our insight on his prejudices. He had few disagreements on the subject with fellow pulp-authors C. L. Moore and Robert E. Howard, among who such subjects sometimes arose. >  The facts are plain. I'm no bigot.- H. P. Lovecraft to J. Vernon Shea, 8 Nov 1933, *Letters to J. Vernon Shea* 177What Lovecraft did do, which folks like Robert E. Howard did not, was to attempt to justify and support his prejudices with a scaffolding of scientific racialism and historical data. In this, he received unconscious support from folks like the United Daughters of the Confederacy who had been spreading revisionist Lost Cause narratives of slavery and the Southern way of life; despite being born and bred in New England, Lovecraft bought into this interpretation of history very strongly and it shaped both his beliefs and how he presented them. When scientific racism began to be dispelled in the by new discoveries, Lovecraft uncharacteristically resisted any modification to these ideas - which is markedly different to how he accepted new discoveries in physics and astronomy, for example. Accepting the idea that there *were* no inferior races, however, would have meant a radical reversal of much of his intellectual life since at least 1905 - and rather than accept the new findings, he accused those involved of being \"sentimentalists.\" >  Moreover\u2014in citing laboratory comparisons of whites  &  blacks, the author merely selects a certain assortment of minor results which happen to look favourable to him; wholly overlooking even more numerous  &  far more weighty tests where Brudder Sambo does not come out so well. Today it is a work of amazing naivet\u00e9 to drag out poor old Prof Boas! There is no more sense in trying to prove a nigger a white man\u2019s equal than in trying to prove a Neanderthal  Man\u2019s corresponding equality. The only reason that sentimental fanatics have not tried to put over the latter piece of folly is that all the Neanderthals are extinct.- H. P. Lovecraft to James F. Morton, 29 Dec 1930, *Letters to James F. Morton* 250I don't want to downplay Lovecraft's racism or his actions or excuse them; just because he lived at a time when racism was heavily prevalent does not mean he had to be racist - Morton and others are proof that you could live in the 1930s and not hold to the idea that black people were physically inferior to white people. But that Lovecraft as a white male did hold those prejudices in that historical context is not surprising--and, judging by his contemporaries, sadly typical.The major difference is not that Lovecraft was incredibly racist for his time, but that we have an incredible *record* of his racism: thousands of pages of letters from an extensive correspondence with dozens of people over a period of years on every conceivable subject.

When the Tang ended in 906 AD the following turmoil during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period saw the end of most of the pre-existing elite genealogies that dated all the way back to the warring states or prior era whether fictitiously or otherwise. Genealogies took a backseat in importance during the Song dynasty and were eclipsed in status by official office titles in the government. This is not to say prestigious families or clans, however you call them, did not exist, but they were based primarily on a narrative of prestigious offices once held by an ancestor.Chinese dynasties were also not officially monogamous in the way Christian European dynasties aspired to be. A cursory look at any Chinese ruler's wiki will give you a list of all their concubines in addition to their wife, who was often interchangeable depending on whom the emperor favored at the moment and was subject to change. Despite this, in reality most Chinese families even prior to the modern era were nuclear with children and their grandparents as dependencies. Concubines were common for those who could afford them but this was probably a minority. Chinese families also practiced a type of exogamy where sons or daughters were not allowed to marry someone of the same family name. So Zhaos avoided marrying Zhaos and Lis avoided marrying Lis. This would have excluded very large portions of the population at any time post-warring states, as Chinese surnames had mostly been whittled down to a [hundred](_URL_0_). As early as the Sui dynasty prestigious surnames had already become common enough that they no longer held the value that they once did, and clans of the surname differentiated among each other using choronyms. For example, a very famous family might call themselves the Zhaos of Zhengling or Zhengling Zhaos, Xiangyang Lis, Dongfeng Wangs, etc. These clans were large and many of their members never even set foot in their clan estates. The Chinese dynastic capitals usually held a hegemonic role in the lives of elite families, certainly Chang'an did, and important members often chose to live at the center of politics rather than remain in their traditional locales. Many abandoned tending to their properties altogether and relocated to Chang'an. This was part of reason why the late Tang rebellions such as Huang Chao and other disasters which damaged Chang'an led to the downfall of the elite lineages that had tied their fate to the court. According to David Johnson, the end of the Tang saw \"class wars\" fueled by \"violently anti-aristocratic feeling\" and that by the end of the 9th century, the aristocracy had become an ideal rather than a social or political reality. A new, more diffuse collective of elite families who justified their dominance over society and politics on the basis of merit, talent, and education would arise during the Song. This \"Confucian\" literati elite is the one most people are familiar with when thinking of China.Epitaph of Liu Neizhe (822):  >  \"When ranking [clans] from around the empire, there are distinctions between those who lead and those who follow; when assessing them, it is unambiguous which are important and which are not. There are those [individuals] who receive the teachings of righteousness and harmony, and who respect the importance of inherited achievements. These individuals have deep esteem for their ancestries and do not take lightly their family relations. Thus, they inevitably marry people of their own station: the men are granted fitting consorts, and the women are matched to [husbands] to whom they submit. With law and morality in perfect agreement, distant and near kin are not at odds with each other. The caps and sashes [of their elegant clothing] are displayed with profusion; their descendants prosper and flourish. This is the way to preserve one's family while respecting one's origins. [One can, thus,] hope never to decline for one hundred generations. Then there are those [individuals] who abandon their families and forget their origins, who go against their duties in order to pursue their own interests. They debase their ancestries while esteeming other [lesser] families; they value wealth, while breaking the [proper] order of the ranks. Thus, they inevitably associate themselves with those who are [socially] remote and distance themselves from those who are [socially] akin. They look towards their own livelihood without understanding the virtue of proper marriage ties; they look for shortcuts without understanding the [more onerous] path of righteousness. This is called the dilution of one's customs and the severe tarnishing of one's family heritage.\" \u570b\u671d\u5dee\u6558\uff0c\u5247\u5148\u5f8c\u6709\u5225\uff1a\u54c1\u85fb\uff0c\u5247\u7d93\u91cd\u751a\u660e\u3002\u5176\u6709\u672c\u4ec1\u7fa9\u96cd\u548c\u4e4b\u6559\uff0c\u7a1f\u95a5\u95b1\u76f8\u627f\u4e4b\u91cd\uff0c\u6df1\u656c\u7956\u59cb\uff0c\u4e0d\u5fd8\u543e\u8026\u3002\u5247\u5fc5\u5e55\u65cf\u985e\u800c\u5a5a\uff0c\u4f9d\u65cf\u985e\u800c\u5ac1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7537\u5f97\u5176\u914d\uff0c\u5973\u9069\u5176\u6b78\uff0c\u6cd5\u6559\u7121\u4e8c\u9014\uff0c\u758f\u621a\u7121\u9592\u8a00\u3002\u7e93\u7dcc\u7d1b\u7db8\uff0c\u679d\u8449\u8543\u660c\u3002\u662f\u70ba\u514b\u5bb6\u656c\u672c\u77e5\u9053\uff0c\u5180\u4e0d\u5931\u65bc\u767e\u4ee3\u4e5f\u3002\u5176\u6709\u6368\u65cf\u5fd8\u672c\uff0c\u7570\u5c1a\u5c01\u5df1\uff0c\u5351\u7956\u4f7f\u800c\u5c0a\u4ed6\u5011\uff0c\u539a\u5e63\u8ca1\u800c\u5206\u7532\u4e59\uff0c\u5247\u5fc5\u89aa\u5176\u6240\u758f\uff0c\u758f\u5176\u6240\u89aa\u3002\u9867\u8863\u98df\u800c\u4e0d\u77e5\u914d\u8026\u4e4b\u7aef\uff0c\u8996\u6b65\u6b66\u800c\u5165\u77e5\u4ec1\u7fa9\u4e4b\u5857\u3002\u5176\u98a8\u4fd7\u4e4b\u6f86\u8584\uff0c\u4fdd\u5bb6\u4e4b\u751a\u75c5\u3002Song Scholar Zheng Qiao (1104-62):  >  \"Up until the Sui and Tang dynasties, officials had dossiers [identifying the offices of their ancestors], and families had genealogies.

Nor do genetic disorders feature very prominently in dynastic histories if at all, however it's not impossible that they were intentionally omitted out of fear of reprisal. There are instances of successors being chosen specifically for having survived epidemics, such as smallpox, but none that are genetic. This wouldn't be too strange given the three reasons I've listed: the lack of an entrenched class of circumscribed noble bloodlines aside from the royal family following the Tang, polygamous relationships, and exogamous marriages. It could also be an oversight in historiographic tradition, and the Chinese simply never focused on it, but given that all Chinese emperors were polygamous, offspring of various descents were numerous and securing a healthy successor does not seem to have posed too much of a problem.

The Soviet industry developed at about the same pace as the West until about 1969, which is when the Soviet government terminated independent Soviet programs in favor of attempting to copy/pirate IBM.As of the late-1980s, Eastern bloc computers were at least 10-20 years behind the West (and Japan). In East Germany for instance, university labs would only have \"one 8-bit Sinclair Spectrum with 64K of RAM for every 10 to 15 scientists.\" This computer was released in the UK in 1982 and only sold for \u00a3125, which obviously placed it within the range of the home computer market. Eastern bloc scientists, more or less, only had a few hours access per week to the same computing power as an average British consumer.At the top-tier of computer development, Soviet scientists in the mid-1980s were developing supercomputers capable of 100 to 10,000 megaflops. In contrast, Americans had developed machines capable of 1.9 gigaflops by 1985. The STAR-100, a machine developed by Control Data Corporation (Minnesota, USA), hit 100 megaflops in the early-1970s.Tracing languages is a bit outside of my knowledge. A journalist in the late-1980s visited a school in Novosibirsk, Russia, and reported that students learned BASIC, ALGOL, FORTRAN and PASCAL, although the latter was only theoretical as no computers in the school could handle it. He also reported his portable Toshiba 1100 Plus PC was more powerful than the single computer shared by \"300 students in Novosibirsk.\" Granted, these anecdotes are likely exaggerated by the politics of the time, but surely some there are some truths to the statements. Also, the Soviet consumer computer industry was virtually non-existent compared to western Europe, America, and Japan by this point. Disclaimer: I do not claim to be an expert in this field, but I do research the history of gaming and computing in 1970s/80s America.

It's used as a name to designate a political entity that is legitimized by the \"common consent of the people\", simply meaning that the authority of the governing body, in this case the state body, is derived from the public and not another source, such as royal inheritance or religious right. However since all States within the United States derive their governmental authority from the common consent of the people, there is no legal distinction between the words \"Commonwealth\" and \"State\" in regards to federal US law and any particular governmental uniqueness in these states (such as Virginia's independent cities) is not tied to the word \"Commonwealth\" and is instead derived directly from the constitution of those states. So while Virginia is officially \"The Commonwealth of Virginia\" any and all legal structure within Virginia is based on it's constitution and any and all of those legal structures could be implemented by a state using the official title \"State\" as long as they are laid out within the officially adopted constitution of that state. Vermont is officially \"The State of Vermont\" but uses the word \"commonwealth\" a few times within it's constitution. In fact Massachusetts officially called itself \"The State of Massachusetts Bay\" until it was officially named the \"Commonwealth of Massachusetts\" by it's constitution. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania also uses the word \"State\" a few times in it's constitution. So in short, it's just a linguistic choice with no official legal distinction within the United States that is used by four states settled predominantly by English settlers and incorporated into the United States prior to 1800. Similar to how counties in Louisiana are called \"parishes\" and called \"boroughs\" in Alaska but any legal distinction between \"county\" and \"parish\" or \"borough\" is derived from the constitution of those states rather than from the words themselves.

Although some of the Founders (notably John Adams) were inspired by Polybius' description of the Roman Republic as a \"mixed constitution\" (a government that blended and balanced aspects of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy), the US Constitution was essentially based on the political theories of the Enlightenment. Individual founders, however, cited figures and institutions from the Roman Republic as negative examples. It was generally agreed that the degradation of the Republic in the late second and first centuries BCE could be attributed to the unchecked ambition of men like Marius, Sulla, and (above all) Caesar. Caesar  - variously likened to George III, Governor Hutchinson, Aaron Burr, and other disagreeable figures - tended to be described as the great villain who brought about the end of the Republic, and was often contrasted with such virtuous champions of liberty as Brutus, Cato and Cicero.  In this sense, the Republic's greatest political lesson was the danger of unlimited power. Some (mostly Anti-Federalists) adduced Caesar and various notorious Roman emperors to argue against a strong executive. The example of Caesar was also used to argue against maintenance of a standing army.The Founders sometimes criticized certain institutions of the Republic in political debate. When arguing for a small Congress during the Constitutional Convention, for example, Madison observed the number of the Tribunes of the Plebs (10) impeded their political effectiveness. When supporting the idea of a single executive, likewise, Hamilton, noted that the inefficient nature of the dual consulship in the Republic necessitated the appointment of a single dictator in times of crisis. John Dickinson, promoting a strong Senate, mentioned that the Roman people's encroachment on the prerogatives of the Senate (via their support of populists and generals) was the ultimate cause of the Republic's downfall.Throughout the era of the Founders, however, it was the specter of Caesar's \"tyranny\" that most blighted perceptions of the Republic as a political model.  & #x200B;R.

I have addressed this in [this post](_URL_1_) where the original poster /u/And_G pointed out some very good validation based on the original German documents; and in [this post](_URL_0_) addressing the 20th century. The long and short of it is that *Swiss Neutrality* is an evolving concept, informed both by the challenges they were facing, and how they want to portray themselves. Further, *Swiss Neutrality* cannot be properly understood without analyzing how the early modern Confederation was set up, and how the modern nation of Switzerland is run. **Swiss-ness in the early modern era**The Swiss national identity can be argued to have begun in the Swabian War triggered by the [Imperial Reform of 1495](_URL_2_). Emperor Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor and Duke of Austria, enacted the *Common Penny* tax that was to be used to raise an Imperial army, and in exchange he agreed to being placed under theoretical supervision by an imperial body. The cheeky Swiss of the so-called *Old Confederation* refused to be subjected to this tax. Maximilian wanted to force the issue through war, forming the Swabian League. However, princes, knights, and peasants of the Swabian League weren't keen for war, and repeatedly expressed their sympathy for \"the Swiss.\" Throwing his glove to the ground, Maximilian declared in exasperation, *\"You can't fight Swiss with Swiss!\"*The winning Swiss forced Maximilian I to revert back to the pre-1495 state of relationships between them and Maximilian, acting as the Duke of Austria. Thus, the cantons of the Old Swiss Confederacy was able to have their cake and eat it, too: they were exempt from paying their dues, even as they remained members of the HRE. Further importantly, in the early modern era, nothing stops a Swiss canton from conducting its own foreign relations, and they did so throughout the early modern era. For example, during the Thirty Years' War -- a confessional war that devastated Europe -- the Swiss Confederation remained theoretically neutral even as its member cantons clearly did not. Catholic and Protestant cantons developed their own leagues of self-defense, and risked civil war within the Confederation. For example, five of the seven Catholic ones signed a treaty with Spain in 1587 that gave it access through these cantons' territories. This effectively empowered Spain as it re-supplied its *Army of Flanders* fighting in the Low Countries. Protestant ones signed an alliance with the English and the Dutch to allow their soldiers to be used to block the use of these same passages. Both sides in the Thirty Years' War recruited Swiss soldiers extensively. In short, to say that the early modern Swiss Confederation \"neutral\" is hubris. It is a confederation based on a set of privileges and responsibilities, and not a nation-state. To be \"Swiss\" was a trait, not to be part of an entity. The last aspect to discuss is then, what does it mean to be Swiss and what does it take to be one? When the Swiss signed a treaty with Maximilian, it was a treaty between the original Old Swiss cantons and Maximilian. The participation of the Swiss in the Peace of Osnabr\u00fcck endowed the Swiss with the power to formally extend membership benefits in this agreement, such that other cantons can join the Confederation and benefit from that treaty, too. Thus, the Swiss were set up closer toward a nation-state as defined by the privileges they gained from that treaty. **Swiss Neutrality in the modern era**The modern Swiss state was a different entity. It is important to note that the modern Switzerland practices direct democracy, so such matters are decided in referendum. To quote its 1848 law: *\u201cthe federal constitution grants the people ultimate power when making and legitimising foreign policy.\"* Further, article 55 of its confederation stipulates that the cantons *\u201cshall be consulted\u201d* in the preparation of foreign policy decisions that *\u201caffect their powers or their essential interests.\u201d*In short, in modern Switzerland the cantons no longer have the ability to conduct their own foreign relations. At the end of WW1 the Swiss joined the League of Nations in a referendum not because it was viewed as a compatible meeting of collective security and neutrality, but because of how the choice was cast. A lot of work was put into demarcating the meaning of neutrality, in particular to differentiate between \"neutrality policy\" and \"the law of neutrality\". The latter is applicable in case of war, the former in times of peace. Thus the Swiss could participate in economic sanctions along with members of the League as long as it is militarily neutral. This is called \"differential neutrality\".The 1920 referendum passed with 56.3% voting yes.This differential neutrality did cause some complications, for example Entente troops weren't allowed to cross Swiss territory even under League sponsorship. However the Swiss were never challenged with sanctions.Over the first part of the 20th century the Swiss moved further into a trading economy, away from its formerly agrarian economy. So there was more pressure to trading and maintaining trading ties especially with neighboring countries. As a result, when Italy invaded Ethiopia in 1935, the Swiss insisted not only on military neutrality but also economic neutrality, or in essence refusing to join in the League's economic sanction against Italy. The Swiss federal council asserts that as a sovereign country, it cannot be forced to comply. Several other members of the League followed suit and thus the concept of differential neutrality fell apart.In 1938 when Germany annexed Austria, the same theme was played with the Swiss declaring they cannot comply with any economic sanction, and even further that the distinction between military and economic neutrality is null. Basically they backed out of their previous position in 1918-1920.Given the failure of the League with the outbreak of WW2, the UN was set up under a different premise, and that neutrality was dead. The allies put pressure on Switzerland's failure to declare war on Nazi Germany and requested the Swiss surrender German assets in Switzerland. Thus, in the early years of the UN the Swiss had no place in the organization. It's only later that the UN started to become more universal, with more recently independent countries wishing to join. With increasing membership, the UN's role around the world increased, and the Swiss became more involved even though they aren't formally a member.Keep in mind though that to seek membership in the UN will require a referendum, and thus what is foreign policy becomes domestic policy. It took many decades for support of economic integration to emerge, and with it the realization that the Swiss cannot endure its political isolation due to non-membership. That's why only in 1986 was there finally sufficient political will to hold a referendum. This ultimately failed because due to lack of debate, and thus votes were run along the party line, and the anti-UN party won.In 2002 things had changed considerably. The Cold War was over. However, the Balkan crises created a refuge crisis that affected the Swiss quite a bit. Thus, the argument that isolation gives safety is now moot, even from a right-wing perspective. More strongly, the Swiss now consented even to sending Swiss troops under UN command, something they had rejected even just a decade prior.So basically to understand the Swiss and neutrality, it is important to understand how both of them have evolved over time, and how the world around them has, too.", "label": 0}, {"content": "Switzerland had an impressive military history up until the early 16th century, at which point they adopted their famous neutrality.

Alexander and his immediate successors actually encouraged \"democracy\" in the Greek cities of their kingdoms; and although this policy was entirely self-serving (they assumed such regimes would be easier to govern), it ensured that many Greek cities at least claimed to be democracies for centuries to come. These cities were, however, almost always either embedded in or allied with large autocratic kingdoms; and their democracy was usually colored by a strong oligarchic element. The coming of Rome accelerated the decline of local democracy. The Romans preferred to deal with oligarchic regimes on the model of their own Republic, and actively encouraged the creation of hereditary local councils in the cities they governed. These attitudes continued under the Principate. In his Roman History, Cassius Dio (writing in the early third century CE) has a counselor advise Augustus to suppress democracies wherever he finds them:\"The affairs of the other cities you should order in this fashion: In the first place, the populace should have no authority in any matter, and should not be allowed to convene in any assembly at all; for nothing good would come out of their deliberations and they would always be stirring up a good deal of turmoil...\" (52.30.2)Greek and Roman intellectuals, moreover, tended to receive a distinctly negative view of Athenian democracy from the Classical authors they read. In the course of his defense of Flaccus, for example, Cicero describes Athens in the following terms:\"But all the republics \\[that is, democracies\\] of the Greeks are governed by the rashness of the assembly while sitting. Therefore, to say no more of this Greece, which has long since been overthrown and crushed through the folly of its own counsels; that ancient country, which once flourished with riches, and rower, and glory, fell owing to that one evil, the immoderate liberty and licentiousness of the popular assemblies. When inexperienced men, ignorant and uninstructed in any description of business whatever, took their seats in the theater, then they undertook inexpedient wars; then they appointed seditious men to the government of the republic \\[democracy\\]; then they banished from the city the citizens who had deserved best of the state. These things were constantly taking place in Athens...\" (16-17)After the rise of the Hellenistic kingdoms, in short, democracy could only have a local role; and after the rise of Rome, it had no place at all.  & #x200B;", "label": 0}, {"content": "Most of the world lived under a Monarchy up until the 1700\u2019s.

To answer your question about views of Hell pre-Dante it depends pretty widely on where and when you were in the early Church. For those Jewish sects who held to the resurrection (The Pharisees and Essenes) the idea was that you went to the underworld (Sheol) which was similar to the Greco/Roman idea of Hades in that it was just a place that the dead went to, and was neither good nor bad. The thought concerning the Resurrection was (and still is for many Jewish theologians) a kind of a benign Universalism. This shifts within Christianity for a number of reasons but the biggest factor I can point to off the bat is the Early Church's apocalyptic nature.  If the Judgement and the resurrection are coming soon, then why do we need to think of Hell as a place where you go immediately after you die? You go to Sheol with everyone else and then after the resurrection it's not about heaven or hell, but about the New Jerusalem or the lake of fire. (I'm pulling this imagery from Revelation 21.)  This sets up the dichotomy that was used by much of the early church. It's not about heaven vs. hell, it's about death vs. life, and all of this is sorted out on the other side of the resurrection, not immediately after you die. The idea of the \"Inferno\" comes from St. Jerome's Latin translation of \"Hades\" in the Greek New Testament (Infernus). (The way that this changes in the early Middle Ages is outside of my area of expertise, so Ill have to leave off with the Early Church.)That being said, Dante's genius was taking Greco/Roman myth surrounding death and punishment and synthesizing it with the Christian imagery of the Lake of Fire and the idea of the \"Infernus.\" So when we think of Hell as a place of very specific torment, that's all Dante. What Milton did to add to all this was to make Satan a compelling character and not just the unholy foil to God's holiness. (The book of Job is the only book of the Bible where Satan doesn't play the Fool.) So when we think of Hell as a place of specific torment for specific Sins, that's Dante. When we think of Satan as cunning and a brilliant orator and tactician, that's Milton.

I don't usually like using the terms rise and fall with empires, but, it helps to divide the eras of growth and shrinking. It became the most powerful state due to it's land acquisition and the efficiency and size of its bureaucracy. Several factors distinguishing it from other Islamic empires in the region led to its superiority, but, I'd argue the distinct rise of the Ottoman Empire began with Mehmet II's (1451-1481) conquering of Constantinople in 1453. Not only was this an important act of land acquisition, it showed superiority of Ottoman weaponry, which is why it is referred to as one of the gunpower empires of the period. Similarly in 1517, Selim I conquered Jerusalem, Mecca, Medina, and Cairo (the capital of the Mamluk Caliphate of Egypt), which not only gave the Ottomans more land, but, gave them a strong religious presence in the Middle East because the Sultan could also claim the title of Caliph. This was used by the few sultans after Selim I to garner unity among its Arab provinces, further increasing the strength of the empire. Statebuilders like Suleiman the Magnificent (1520-1566) (whose reign is regarded as the peak of the empire) helped to achieve more efficient bureaucracy throughout the empire by reforming taxes; he also helped by reforming the empires form of Islam to something resembling the Hanafi school of Sunni Islam, which is known for being the most accepting of non-Arabs and non-Muslims, which actually made up a large percentage of the Ottoman population (mostly in Palestine, Rumelia, Serbia, and Anatolia). Other institutions such as the Devsirme helped to increase the efficiency and strength of the Ottomans as a whole. The Devsirme was an institution of enslaved Christian boys, usually from Rumelia, who were given the best educations i nthe world, and depending on whether their proficiencies were academic or physical, were made government officials or recruited into the Janissary corps, forming intelligent and strong politicians and armies.The decline is often seen as starting with Napoleon's invasion of Egypt in 1798 just because it showed that Europe had achieved military superiority in the century prior. While England and France never went further into the Ottoman Empire, they were now getting the Economic benefits of the Ottoman's North African provinces, weakening the Ottoman financial state. Also, with the revolutions going on around the world in the prior decades, the rise of nationalism was spreading throughout Europe, and the European provinces of the Ottoman empire began revolting in the early nineteenth century, and they eventually lost Greece and Serbia to revolutions inspired by nationalistic sentiment. From 1300 until the 1790's, the Ottomans were too proud to send ambassadors to any European countries because they felt that Constantinople had more important business than London or France. Selim III in the 1790's finally sent ambassadors to France, London, Berlin, and Vienna, showing a shift in international politics that the Ottomans were no longer the biggest, best empire. By the nineteenth century too, the Janissaries, the pride of the Ottoman Empire, became entirely nepotistic. As a result, Selim III (1789-1807) tried to abolish them in 1806, hoping to institute a new, European trained army known as the Nezam-i Cedid (New Order). The Janissaries ultimately felt threatened and ended up deposing and killing Selim III. Mahmud II (1808-1839), his successor, didn't make the same mistake and had all the Janissaries slaughtered in 1826. By this point, the Ottomans now lost their most advanced military after a Sultan had been murdered by the soldiers sworn to protect him. The same year Mahmud II died, Rashid Pasha, one of the Ottoman governors, wrote an edict called the Hatt-i Serif of Ghulane, which essentially proposed standard military drafts, protection of honor and property, and equality of *all* Ottoman subjects regardless of ethnicity or religion. This document started an era known as \"Tanzimat\" (reorganization) in which intellectual elites from Constantinople pushed for a constitutional government. They were mostly ignored, though continued to demonstrate, for about 35 years. When Sultan Abdulhamid II took the throne in 1876, he instituted the constitution, which followed the same ideas as the Hatt-i Serif, but retracted it 2 years later, ending the First Constitutional Era. In the late 1870's, the Ottomans lost even more land, almost the entirety of their Caucus population, to the Russian Empire. They were now reduced to Anatolia (modern day turkey) and Arabia in effect. By the twentieth century a new group of exiled intellectuals (based mostly in Paris) called the Young Turks (formally the Committee of Union and Progress) formed and continued to demonstrate throughout the decade. They overthrew Abdulhamid II (1876-1908) in 1908, made their party leaders the head of the Ottoman government, and appointed the new Sultan as nothing more than a figurehead. The inexperienced leaders thought they would do good by ending strings of nepotism throughout the Ottoman empire's provinces, namely the Arab ones (where Abdulhamid had spend 3 decades securing loyalty and trust among Arab leaders). Removing influential governors from power around the provinces, they lost most of the support they had from the remaining territory they had. Ultimately, they only entered World War I because they wanted to regain the land they lost in the Caucuses 4 decades before, but, were ultimately unable to do that, and were too frail to survive the war having lost most of their land, money, and military in the decades prior.Edit: An important factor to mention about them being viewed as the \"sick man of Europe\" is that England and an Ottoman Arab Emir in Mecca had secret correspondence regarding a planned revolt within the Empire that was meant to overthrow the Committee of Union and Progress and allow the British to take power of Anatolia after that was done. Because of this, Europeans became more aware of how little the population of the Ottoman empire actually agreed with the ruling class. Look up the Hussein-McMahon letters and the Arab revolt to look more into it.For more information like this, look at:A Concise History of the Modern Middle East by Arthur Goldschmidt and Lawrence DavidsonandA History of the Modern Middle East by William Cleveland and Martin Bunton.Edit 2: Also, if there are any further questions about any specifics, please ask.

What he maintained is a so-called \"duty diary\" (Dienstkalender), meaning a notebook where he wrote down all dates, meetings, appointments, and activities related to his work as Reichsf\u00fchrer SS plus sometimes a quick note what happened when and where. [This is what the duty diary looks like](_URL_3_). You can see here his appointments for 18.9.1943 which include entries like \"SS Obergruppenf\u00fchrer Berger [Head of the SS Main Office Gottlob Berger] and Stabschef M\u00f6ckel [Chief of Staff of the Hitler Youth Helmut M\u00f6ckel]\"; \"Situation report with F\u00fchrer\"; and \"Lunch with F\u00fchrer\". The duty diaries for 1941/42 were discovered in the Special Archive in Moscow in the mid-1990s and published by Peter Witte and Michael Wildt in 1999 and recently the duty diaries for 1943\u20131945 and 1937\u20131938 have also been found and are currently being prepared for publication by the German Historical Institute in Moscow.The mentioned quote does not come from the duty diaries but has been reported long already in 1945 since it was relayed by Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, Higher SS and Police Leader in Minsk and plenipotentiary for anti-Partisan warfare in the occupied Soviet Union about a visit of Himmler's to Minsk and a mass execution undertaken there by Einsatzgruppe B under the leadership of Arthur Nebe on August 15, 1941. Bach-Zelewski in his capacity very much responsible for the murder of thousands had an interesting post-war career, so to speak. Arrested by US authorities in August 1945, he was one of the few high-ranking Nazis who declared that he would appear as a voluntary witness for the prosecution at the International Military Tribunal's trial of the main war criminals in Nuremberg. He willingly and extensively testified against Himmler and others at Nuremberg and spoke openly and candidly about the Holocaust and the mass murder in the Soviet Union. Some historians assume that because of this, he never faced a trial for war crimes and was never extradited to either Poland or the Soviet Union. Rather, the West Germans sentenced him twice for the murder of political opponents in the 1930s but he only served 15 years of prison until his death in 1973. While he spoke openly in Nuremberg, he later gave evidence for Eichmann's defense when the latter was tried in Jerusalem and wrote several texts in which he later contradicted his own testimony in Nuremberg. Jan Kreutz of Hamburg University has a study of von dem Bach forthcoming that seems rather interesting as it explores his biography in a new and exciting way but I digress.Anyways, the cited quote was relayed by Bach-Zelewski in his testimony about Himmler's visit to Minsk in 1941. It's part of a 60-page handwritten testimony by Bach that can be viewed translated and machine typed in the Yad Vahsem Archives today (YVA, O.18/90) and that can also be read [here](_URL_4_). It was printed in the August 23, 1946 edition of the New York newspaper *Aufbau*, which you can read (in German) [here](_URL_1_). It is this account by Bach-Zelwski that has contributed to the notoriety of this particular visit of Himmler to Minsk, which consisted of a report about the mass murder in the Pripjet area on August 14, the mass execution and visit to a POW camp on August 15, and subsequently a tour of the Ghetto and a mental asylum. Himmler would also later in October visit Mogilew to see a mass execution and in February 1943 visit the Sobibor camp to see the mass-gassings there.We know for certain that Himmler was there. The mass execution is noted in duty diary and there even exists [film footage of his visit](_URL_0_). Some historians however, such as Christian Gerlach, Volker Ries, and Jochen Lang, doubt the exact content of Bach's description, including the \"savages\" quote and in the larger context call into the question his narrative that because Himmler witnesses mass-shootings, he ordered a more \"humane\" method for the executioners to be found. Himmler noted in his duty diary that he gave a speech to the men of Einsatzgruppe B while in Minsk about the necessity of their task and would later return to the topic in his Posen Speech in October 1943 when he said: >  Most of you here know what it means when 100 corpses lie next to each other, when there are 500 or when there are 1,000. To have endured this and at the same time to have remained a decent person \u2014 with exceptions due to human weaknesses \u2014 has made us tough, and is a glorious chapter that has not and will not be spoken of. Because we know how difficult it would be for us if we still had Jews as secret saboteurs, agitators and rabble-rousers in every city, what with the bombings, with the burden and with the hardships of the war.While this is consistent with the above, Bach-Zelewski's narrative that because Himmler was so repulsed by the mass shootings that he ordered new methods to be found has been called into somewhat into question by Gerlach _URL_2_., not just because nothing of the like is reported about his visits to Mogilew and Sobibor but also because gassing as a means of mass murder had already been mentioned before by this point. The first experiments with gassing had already taken place in October 1939 in the Posen concentration camp under the auspices of Albert Widmann, chemist and member of the Criminal Technical Institute (KTI), Department V D 2 (Chemistry and Biology). Widmann would then work on developing stationary gas chambers to be used in the T4 Action to murder mentally and physically handicapped inmates of institutions in both Germany and Poland and would go on to develop the first gas van used by the Sonderkommando of Hermann Lange to murder Polish inmates of mental asylums throughout 1940. It was Lange with whom Bach-Zelewski and Arthur Nebe got in touch with shortly after the Himmler visit in Minsk and inquired about seeing the gas van in action.However, Gerlach points out that already on August 8, 1941 a Wehrmacht officer reported about his visit to Liepaja in Latvia that rumors were abound that the Germans were planning to murder Jews with gas and \u2013 more importantly \u2013 that on July 28, 1941 Viktor Brack, one of the main perpetrators of the T4 action, had visited the Wehrmacht's General Quarter Master, General Thomas, to inquire about receiving material support for their special mission from the F\u00fchrer. Since the T4 program had not planned any sort of expansion for the summer of 1941, it stands to reason that what they wanted was material support for their development of the second generation of gas vans, which subsequently saw action with the Einsatzgruppen in October 1941.In light of this, Gerlach et. al. have rejected the idea that Himmler ordered new methods of mass killing to be developed for the Einsatzgruppe because of his concerns for the mental well-being of his men. Rather, it seems that he informed Bach-Zelewski and Nebe while in Minsk that in order to provide a faster method of killing, gas vans were in development and that they should get in touch with Lange and the KTI about these new methods, which both of them dutifully did.In short, the veracity of Bach-Zelewski's narrative about the development of new killing methods because of Himmler's concern has been called into question somewhat. While Himmler at several times referred to the genocide as a \"difficult/hard but necessary duty\" and something to be \"endured\" [durchgehalten], the development of new methods of gassing as way to support the killing operations precedes his visit to Minsk and there is a lack of similar stories about Himmler's later visits to either mass killings or concentration camps.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The SS was a cult, and the SS was a cult that was based on the cult of the Nazi party.

The Malthusian trap is the concept that for most of human history, we have been subsistence farmers and the standard of living never rose for most humans above subsistence farming levels. We also know that the technological advances that happened before the industrial revolution mostly caused rises in *population* rather than in *standard of living*. Once we understand that key concept, we have our real answer. The Victorians (as with most of Europe, the United States etc.) broke out of the Malthusian trap. This isn't exactly an exciting answer if you exclude why they managed to break out so I'll go into that in some detail.Now, please note that the causes of the industrial revolution in Britain and abroad still remains a major source of debate between historians so I'll do my best to provide some differing opinions. The first major cause for the industrial revolution for most historians is the major fall in the mid to late 17th and early 18th century in infant mortality. Mostly because by the mid 17th century the British were starting to abandon the old medical ways. Up until this point, medicine in Britain was still, frankly, medieval. The late 17th century would see the abandonment of many of the worse of what passed for medicine at the time (Bleedings, theory of humours, etc.) for a more scientific approach. It should also be said that during this time, there was a marked increase in the quality and frequency of border controls. Prof. Paul Slack author of *The Impact of Plague in Tudor and Stuart England* points to this being a major factor in the reduction of frequency in instances of the Plague. Which means that diseases, in general, began to spread far less widely than they did in the past. This may have simply resulted in a rise in population but this time around it was considerably different because the rise in population coincided with major and numerous other advances. Which brings me to our second cause. The massive increases in both farm labour (their productivity, to be clear) and land productivity. It all starts with the rise in the enclosure of farmland which reduces the amount of common land. The Crown and the Church had always been the two major land owners in Europe since the middle ages. In England, under Henry VIII, the Suppression of the Monasteries would free up massive swaths of land for free peasantry. It would gradually ramp up the enclosure and *improvement* of farmlands in comparison to their common land equivalent. The Dutch also contributed a lot to the increase in productivity. the first major advancement used in Britain was the water-meadow. A system of pasture irrigation that isn't in use today but was a major advancement in the 16th-17th century in England. It allowed for the pasturing of livestock far earlier by keeping worked pastures in the spring damp, keeping frost off the ground and making grass grow several weeks earlier. *This has no bearing on the question but I still think it's a fun little fact, men who took care and maintained water-meadows were called drowners. Not sure where this could've fit into my explanation so I'll just put it in here...*Agriculture during the period leading up to and during the industrial revolution is also marked by the introduction of scientific selective breeding. It saw the notable creation of the Dishley Leicester, the most productive sheep of it's era, and improvement of the Dishley Longhorn, which was the first beef cattle. Many contemporary sources talk of cattle weighing twice what they weighed after Bakewell's improvement of the breed, which is a considerable amount of extra productivity in cattle alone. But let's return to the contributions of the Dutch for a moment, a notable engineer Cornelius Vermuyden, had by the end of the 17th century popularized the use of Dutch land maintenance methods. There are varying estimates about the effects of the land maintenance reform but there is no debating that it led to a substantial increase in the amount of usable arable land. Which meant that farms often increased in size. The last truly farm-based improvement was the development of the Norfolk four-course crop rotation. Farmers switched from a three field system that resulted in large parts of farmland being left unproductive every season to one where there was very little need to leave any part of their land fallow. Where the British usually had fallow fields, they now put turnips or clovers on which to graze cattle, re-nitrate the soil and keep down weeds. Combined with the new breeds of cattle I've already talked about, this was a significant improvement. So, this all meant that farms were far more productive *far more easier* than they used to be. Which meant that they could be worked by significantly less people. All at the time of a massive surge in population. The population of Britain went from around 9 million in 1800 to nearly 42 million in 1901. This was also the age where the British realized that they could transport goods inside the country far easier using industrial canals. So centralized production of goods was most definitely in.So in short, as jobs left the countryside to the cities, so did people.

To paraphrase the late Timothy Reuter, the area between the Loire and the Humber (i.e. Northern France and Southern England) *was* Europe. All of the main meta-narratives of traditional history  as written (in English, in any case) in the twentieth century, focusing in particular on 'feudalism', state-building and intellectual developments was written with the assumption that this region was the core of Western Europe and that what was true for this region was true elsewhere as well. In this sense, the exclusion of Ireland wasn't unique, but part of a wider narrative of excluding more 'peripheral' areas which were difficult to integrate into this picture derived from the 'core'. Thankfully, this kind of thinking isn't as present in modern-day historiography (although its legacy remains) and there are a lot of people now writing history which seeks to integrate the 'centre' and 'periphery' of Europe in a single narrative. Robert Bartlett's *The Making of Europe* (1993) is probably the first major work to make this kind of agenda explicit.However, some of Ireland's own peculiarities are also to blame for its isolation from the historiographical mainstream. Firstly, the historiography of medieval Ireland has been very deeply rooted in modern political concerns since its inception. Early historians like Eoin McNeill and Henry Orpen sought either to paint native Ireland as a Celtic golden-age paradise ('the Island of Saints and Scholars') or as a backwards mess ready to be civilized by Norman (=English) governmental institutions, respectively. Although not as blatant nowadays, there's still a tenancy for these legacies to live on to a certain extent. In addition to this, until the 1990s this nationalist framework and debates meant that very little Irish history sought to engage with the world beyond Ireland or to tie Irish medieval history into wider narratives of medieval Europe.This divide between those who study Gaelic Ireland and 'English' Ireland has persisted not least because of the difficulties of the sources. Medieval Ireland has an unusually large base of sources, but they are incredibly difficult to interpret. The rich vernacular written culture has left us with thousands of law texts, medicinal tracts, poems and hagiographical works written in Old and Middle Irish, but little in the way of historical writing, with the exception of the famously laconic Irish Annals. Locked away in an obscure language and largely untranslated, these texts have been studied mostly by scholars coming from a philological rather than a historical background, more interested in the development of the language and the text than the historical value. On the 'Norman/English' side of things, the destruction of virtually all the medieval records of the English government in Dublin with the shelling of the Public Records Office during the Irish Civil War in 1922 has left many central and later medievalists searching for scraps of sources amongst the notes and published works of 19th century archivists. A combination of a small and fractured groups of active scholars and the difficulty of working with medieval Irish sources have slowed the development of historical work on Ireland considerably. Thankfully, however, things are changing. More attention than ever is being given to important Irish figures who contributed to wider European movements, such as Columbanus' monastic network in the 7th century, St Malachai of Armagh's links with the Cistercians in the 12th and the ecclesiastical, political and intellectual importance of Richard FitzRalph, Archbishop of Armagh in the 14th. Ireland is being integrated into wider European history more generally too. In addition to the work of Bartlett (mentioned above), it formed a case-study region in Chris Wickham's influential socio-economic history *Framing the Early Middle Ages* (2005). Most promising, however, is the work being done on the 'New British History' of the central and late middle ages. Drawing on the work of the late Rees Davies (especially *The First English Empire* (2000)), historians such as David Carpenter, Peter Crooks and Michael Brown have been working to integrate the history of British Isles much more closely, arguing that connections between what are now seen as four distinct nations were so deep, numerous and pervasive in the middle ages that they cannot be viewed in isolation. So while it does remain outside the mainstream, Irish medieval history is certainly headed towards a more holistic and integrated future.", "label": 0}, {"content": "Medieval Ireland is generally excluded from standard histories of the Middle Ages.

Kanner and Asperger's tandem research on what we now call autism, for example, was done in the 1930s and 40s. What medieval people did have was observation: an awareness that certain people acted *differently*. Whereas today cognitive and psychiatric conditions are diagnoses by medical professionals (or, I suppose, by Dr. Google), in the Middle Ages it would have been a process of social recognition. At what point did a person's *difference* render it difficult or impossible for them to fit into normal society?For the most part, we know, people whose disabilities rendered them unable to function on their own were the responsibility of their families. We have a few snatches of stories from saints' miracle collections where the healing miracle gives us one or two sentences about the previous condition. These stories often involve siblings transporting the person to the shrine, or a mother describing how she used to help her adult child get dressed every day.Only at the very end of the Middle Ages, the 15th century, do we see the first *formal* establishment of institutions dedicated to people with cognitive/mental disabilities in the West. It's possible that there would have been some similarly disabled people residing in earlier monastic hospitals along with the indigent and indigent (physically) sick, but not on a focused basis. To be sure, these 15C institutions were not hospitals or sanitoria in the modern sense, with a goal of treatment. It was just a place for them to live and maybe learn a little bit about God.We learn a little more about the roles of the cognitively impaired in medieval society through law codes and religious sources. Already in late antiquity, Roman civil law distinguished crimes committed by someone unwell, that is, \"insane\"--with fuller descriptions making it clear that these laws typically applied to criminals with cognitive impairment, not the temporary insanity we all know from Law  &  Order.From the high Middle Ages, it *used* to be standard scholarly practice to assume mental disability was interpreted as demonic possession. We now know that's far from a blanket assertion. The 13th century *holy woman* Christina Mirabilis (Christina the Astonishing), for example, is sometimes pointed to as a (non-canonized) saint whose hagiography pretty clearly depicts her as cognitively different than her peers, even after accounting for medieval hagiographic topoi. (The part where she climbs trees and chirps like a bird, for example.) In other cases, yes, mental illness might be perceived as a demonic intrustion, especially if it developed later in life rather than being present from birth. There are some cases of nuns described in a manner reminiscent of various mental illnesses who are denied the Eucharist because of it!But heaven and hell certainly weren't the only options--or even, oddly enough, the primary concern. Indeed, where we see authorities intervening in cognitive health isn't to perform exorcisms and certainly not to force recantation of heresy. No, it's to regulate ownership and inheritance of property!In late medieval into early modern England, for example, \"idiots\" and \"lunatics\" (those are the terms) were designated wards of the king--similar to minor children who were considered unfit to make legal decisions for themselves. This wasn't to ensure they were cared for; this gave the crown control over any property they owned. As a result, we have some really fascinating records of court cases where people sue to have themselves ruled \"not an idiot\". More frequently and sadly, though, we see family members in court on the cognitively impaired person's behalf, basically using them as a pawn in order to maintain control of property within one lineage or seize it for their spouse's extended family.Further reading:* Irina Metzler, *A Social History of Disability in the Middle Ages** Margaret McGlynn, \"Idiots, Lunatics, and the Royal Prerogative in Early Tudor England,\" *Journal of Legal History* 26 (2006)* Teresa Huguet-Termes and Jon Arrizabalaga, \"Hospital Care for the Insane in Barcelona, 1400-1700,\" *Bulletin of Spanish Studies* 87, no. 8 (2010)", "label": 0}, {"content": "In the Middle Ages and earlier, people with Down Syndrome and autism were often viewed as a curse.

The subsidies varied depending on who was in power, but they supported a large dependent population. The first politician to enact a grain subsidy was Gaius Gracchus in 122 BCE, allowing citizens to purchase a set amount of grain each month at a fixed price. When Sulla was dictator, between 82 and 81, he abolished the subsidy because it was a drain on the treasury, but this act was tremendously unpopular with the common people, and Lepidus brought the subsidies back almost immediately after Sulla left office. When Clodius was tribune in 58, he made the monthly grain ration free. So many people were reliant on the free grain that when Caesar became dictator in 45, he had to limit the number of rations to 150,000. These political squabbles over grain tell us that there were a lot of people in Rome who relied on the government for food, who would have been completely out of luck if they'd lived in the countryside. Indeed, many people were forced out of the countryside, unable to farm because of military obligations to the ever-expanding empire. When the men of the rural families were drafted, the women and children had no way to support themselves, so they drifted to the city and began living off the state. Grain subsidies became a Roman institution, and to take away the grain was political suicide. The satirist Juvenal coined the phrase \"bread and circuses\" to describe this relationship between the politicians and populace of Rome. Grain subsidies were such an important institution that when Constantine moved the capital to Constantinople in the fourth century, he instituted a grain subsidy there which fed 80,000 people.Source: A Brief History of the Romans, by Boatwright et. al.", "label": 0}, {"content": "In ancient times, cities were a major source of wealth for their populations.

The Holy League managed to beat the Turkish army almost entirely because of the weather. The League soldiers had a small advantage in musketry (the Ottomans were notoriously slow to adapt on that front), but the Ottomans had a huge advantage in basically every other category. Even if the number of guns they supposedly brought to the field is significantly greater than what they actually had, they almost certainly had a significant advantage in artillery. They had a massive advantage in manpower. The Turks had the advantage of only needing one command language (and there were already systems in place for integrating Tartar auxiliaries and client state levies) whereas the League had to juggle numerous languages: French, Hungarian, Czech, Croat, Italian, and at least two (probably more) German languages. The Ottomans also had a *vastly* superior logistical network, though that wouldn't play a huge role in the outcome of any specific battle beyond allowing the Ottomans to concentrate an unusually large number of men in a given area. All of which is to say that, even accounting for the fact that Montecuccoli was a likely a better commander, the balance of probability says that Ahmed Koprulu should have won the battle. But the weather backfired. When Koprulu's troops initially crossed the river, it was at an unusually low level: his army could pretty much just march across. The Carpathian basin is criss-crossed with numerous rivers where that usually isn't the case; standard Ottoman procedure was to use a combination of purpose-built bridges and pontoon bridges. But since that wasn't necessary, those additions were never built. And then the river flooded overnight. Suddenly the Ottoman army was cut in half. The League capitalized on this and attacked. The vanguard (largely professional troops lacking artillery support) were effectively cut off. They were cut to pieces. Large enough numbers of them drowned trying to ford the flooded river that Western records of the battle often spend a good deal of time talking about the weather (Sir Paul Rycaut, who was attached to the British embassy in Constantinople at the time, used terms like \"deluge\" to describe the flood). Koprulu still had a rather huge army even after the defeat, but having lost so many of his professional soldiers, and facing some unusually hostile weather, he ended the campaign nearly a month before the usual Ottoman end date. And the Ottomans were well aware of these limitations: the year before Koprulu had received a letter from Mehmet IV ordering him to end the campaign by mid October at the latest. Koprulu would ultimately capture Uyvar before Mehmet IV's deadline, but the incident shows that the Ottomans were well aware of the problems of campaigning in Hungary when October rolls around. Koprulu's campaign ground to a halt not long after Uyvar fell: after it became clear that it was taking his artillery an entire day to move as far as his infantry could move in an hour, the campaign was basically done (the usual Ottoman expectations suggest a ratio closer of 2:3 for infantry and artillery). Mehmet IV's caution probably has something to do with Suleiman's retreat from Vienna in 1529. Suleiman maintained the siege into October and when he abandoned it, he forced his army to endure an awful march home. He lost most of his baggage train while crossing the Leitha at Bruck (which isn't terribly far from Vienna; it's still in modern day Austria). In addition to an appreciable chunk of his war materiel, he also lost most of the tents.

In fact, I can go a step further and say that Rome's men most CERTAINLY did not like the idea of such a relationship - however, that's not to say that it didn't happen. There's a really good part of *Emperors and Gladiators* that almost specifically concerns this question - I'll type it out here for you. > Women as well as men found gladiatorial contests, and gladiators, attractive. Some much-quoted epigraphic evidence suggests that this attraction might be sexual: at Pompeii, the *retarius* Crescens was known as 'the netter of girls by night' and 'the girls' darling'. Thracians were a favourite symbol of manliness because much of their body was left visible to the audience. This obviously constituted a potential danger to the Roman male's control over his womenfolk. Augustus restricted women, other than the six Vestal Virgins, to watching gladiators from the rearmost rows of seats. It proved impossible to put a stop to stories about sexual associations between gladiators and women of the elite, even including empresses. The wife of Marcus Aurelius, Faustina, was suspected of having had affairs with gladiators; only this could explain why her son Commodus was so interested in the sport. ... Roman anxieties about the sexual attractions of gladiators are given expression by the fact that they are classified together with prostitutes in Roman legislation, and that grammatical texts associate the Latin word for the gladiator's trainer (*lanista*) with that for a pimp (*leno*). Like pimps and prostitutes, public performers such as actors and gladiators sold their bodies for the delectation of others, if only visually.Again - sorry about the long quote, but I believe that it matches your question perfectly; while we have nothing in the way of SUBSTANTIAL proof that they were used as prostitutes as Hollywood suggests, we do have proof that the men of Rome were threatened by them. They were considered prostitutes, doing the equivalent of selling their bodies for the pleasure of viewers, and rumours abounded about their possible sexual conquests. Roman rumour was a pretty big deal to them - it was a large part of how the latest news got spread, and it really defined Romans. So when rumours (especially about the Empress!) had these women sleeping with gladiators, it was a comment on their character. Whether those rumours were spread by political opponents or the people is tough to say - however, the propaganda wars of Rome are *legendary* to say the least.

Hitler and the Germans did not so much see the declaration of war as the start of a *quid quo pro* process with Japan leading to a Japanese invasion of Siberia, but rather an opportunity to gain time and militarily isolate the United States by giving German armed forces a free hand in the Atlantic and encourage the Japanese to keep fighting in the Pacific.   Both Hitler and German military planners were not on board with the bombing of Pearl Harbor itself mostly because they were completely ignorant of Japanese the scale and extent of Japanese planning. Although the Japanese occupation of French Indochina and the resulting US blockade of strategic raw materials  made it apparent that war in the Pacific was imminent, German leaders were in the dark about future military operations. Two days before Pearl Harbor, the German Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop actually hoped that America would be the one to instigate military aggression against Japan. Von Ribbentrop's thoughts on the situation in the Pacific was emblematic of much of German geostrategic thought in the winter of 1941. The actions of the USN in the Battle of the Atlantic in which US ships jettisoned most pretensions of neutrality indicated that the US was readying to enter into the war. Although an expansion of the war carried with it new uncertainties, a number of German military planners mistakenly concluded that Japan's entry into the was in the Pacific was largely beneficial to Germany's strategic interests. Part of this miscalculation stemmed from the dire situation Germany had found itself in at the end of 1941. Although Barbarossa had achieved spectacular gains, the German invasion had not achieved the desired result of a complete collapse of the Soviets. The strengthening Soviet resistance and counterattacks was a bitter pill for the Germans to swallow. Moreover, the strengthening of the British military position in North Africa and the Atlantic seemed to threaten German-occupied Europe's southern and western flanks. German planners hoped that Japanese conquests in East Asia and the Central Pacific would rectify this global strategic balance by forcing both the British and Americans to reorient their military resources to the Pacific. An OKW strategic assessment produced on 14 December outlined their expectations for the British response:  > Securing her position in the Middle East has gained even greater importance for Britain since Japan's entry into the war-not only because of the Persian and Mesopotamian oil, on which the British navy in the Indian Ocean must depend once the oil wells of Borneo and Sumatra are lost to it, but also because of the especially important maintenance of sea communications through the Suez Canal and because of the air communications, based upon this region, between the mother country and India, East Asia, and Australia. Execution of this strategic task will no doubt be seen by Britain to be just as vital as the maintenance of her Indian-Malayan position, which is crucial for the safeguarding of India, Australia, and New Zealand. In OKW's estimation, the Japanese conquest of SE Asian rubber, tin, and oil sources would deprive the British and Americans, and by extension the Soviets, of this strategic war material. The *Kriegsmarine*, facing its first serious reversals in the Battle of the Atlantic and Mediterranean, welcomed the thought that both the RN and USN meeting the Japanese naval challenge would give German and Italian naval forces time to regroup. The declaration of war gave the *Kriegsmarine* a free hand to attack American shipping without as much interference from the USN and RN. According to the Naval Staff's estimation, expanding the war would divide Allied naval power, which prior to Pearl Harbor was in seeming danger of uniting.  Underlying this German enthusiasm for Japanese belligerence was the hope that the Japanese would present enough of a strategic diversion to allow German military forces to complete the job in the USSR they had begun the previous June. The defeat of the USSR remained the main strategic priority for Germany military planning. Only the *Kriegsmarine* evinced any great interest for a grand military hookup with the Japanese in India. Although both the Navy and von Ribbentrop urged Hitler to agree to a joint Axis declaration on India, the German leader refused on the grounds that such an anticolonial measure was not in the strategic interests of Germany. Hitler held out hopes that an anti-Churchill faction would come to the fore once Stalin had been beaten and threatening India would supposedly undercut support for a separate peace.  OKW began in 1942 tentative plans for a wider invasion of the Middle East, but only after the success of Blue's offensive in the Caucasus.  Hitler's declaration of war on America gave German military much greater latitude to plan for a western defensive barrier. Expanding the war would also cow the various neutrals on Germany's flanks (Turkey, Spain, and Sweden) to accede to German demands. German entry into the war on Japan's side would also prevent the latter from making a separate peace prematurely. This was in keeping with the Third Reich's strategic thinking with regards to the Anglo-American powers in that it was in German interests to keep them preoccupied outside of areas controlled by Germany.  OKW's 14 December report claimed the prognosis for the following year good for these four reasons: >  I) Within the period left to it before the full mobilization of the American war machine, Germany would reach its military objectives in the east, in the Mediterranean, and in the Atlantic. >  II) Germany would succeed, by political means, not only in inducing its allies to intensify their war efforts, but also in securing the periphery by bringing the flanking powers-hitherto neutral-of Turkey, Spain, Portugal, and Sweden into the continental defensive bloc. >  III) The Japanese offensive would have enough endurance and momentum to tie down a substantial part of the Anglo-American potential in the Pacific for a considerable time.       > IV) Under these circumstances the United States would not be able to conduct an offensive two-ocean war in the foreseeable future.The experience of 1942 would prove each of these suppositions unduly optimistic. In short, the Germans believed that they possessed both the time and the resources to meet the new strategic challenge. They fundamentally underestimated America's industrial capabilities and overestimated the ability of Japan to act as a sink for Anglo-American resources. Even more fatally, both Hitler and OKW overestimated both Germany's own ability to deliver a fatal blow in Operation Blue and their chances of securing their strategic flanks with secondary forces like DAK and the *Kriegsmarine*. In a minor defense of German planners, there were some kernels of truth underneath their strategic delusions. The loss of Southeast Asian rubber sources initially was a source of considerable consternation to Anglo-American planners. But synthetic rubber, recycling, and African and Latin American rubber plantations were able to minimize the effect of such losses upon the Allied war effort. The German's confidence in their Japanese allies' ability to hold the Pacific in part stemmed from the Japanese themselves. The German naval attache in Japan had received unprecedented access into the IJN's construction programs, including the new *Yamato*-class superbattleships that were to beat American quantity with quality. Finally, the Germans estimated that it would take time for the Americans to make the full weight of its armaments known on the European continent. German experience in the First World War had shown them that the US took a considerable time to mobilize both its vast population and industry for wartime. Although American preparations for war were much further along in 1941 than they were in 1917, it was not until 1943/44 that the quantity of American arms had really begun to make itself felt on Europe.  *Sources*Kershaw, Ian. *Hitler, 1936-1945: Nemesis*.

There were incidents were US military was suddenly on alert over false reports or glitches. (Note: during none of these was the nuclear \"football\" ever activated).On  November 24th, 1961 SAC had a communication failure  with the three Ballistic Missile Early Warning Sites or BMEWS. Thule (Greenland,) Clear (Alaska,) and Fillingdales (England,) all lost contact with SAC, leaving them with two possibilities: enemy action (either cutting off communication or the BNEWS site had been taken out) or some sort of coincidental failure of the redundant communication systems at the same time. SAC order bases on alert with B-52 on stand by. Eventually the command made contact B-52 that was on airborne alert near Thule which managed to contact the base via radio confirming there had been no attack. As it turned out all of the communication lines ran through a single relay station in that had overheated. In November 9, 1979 at NORAD HQ, SAC Command Post, The Pentagon National Military Command Center, and the Alternate National Military Command Center the display systems all showed incoming nuclear missiles. The Duty officer at NORAD contacted PAVE PAWS to determine that no early warning radars had picked up incoming or had any of the US satellites. The cause was later determined to a be exercise tape had been placed in the computer system. The officers in command at the time (especially in regards to the NORAD OIC) managed to call off the alarm in 6 minutes. This incident led to the creation off-site testing facility so any test wouldn't cause this again (this was after a Congressional hearing and GOA investigation recommend the move). 3 June 1980: Single computer chip failure in the command system had random 0's display as 2's, thus showing that 2 missiles had been fired, the 200, etc. while precautions had been taken just in case (readying Minuteman missiles, bomber crews prepped for take off) it was not taken as seriously as the year prior due to the random numbers received and that all the commands were getting different displays.On October 25, 1973: In response to intelligence that the Soviets were planning to intervene in the Arab Israeli conflict as the cease fire failed Nixon moved US force to DEFCON 3 as a show of force hoping to back the Soviets down. During this mechanics were repairing one of the Klaxons (the sirens) at Kinchole Air Force Base accidentally activated the whole base alarm system. In response to the alarm B-52 crews rushed to their aircraft and started the engines. Once again it was the duty officer who recognized that alarm was false, cancelling the alert and recalled the crews before they took off.There were several close calls on both sides during the Cuban Missile Crisis two resulting from false alarms from Moorestown indicating ICBMS over the US due to a different test tape. In both cases the NORAD OIC waited until the expected nukes had gone off (they were reported over the US already and it limited numbers) and saw that they were false.In another case a bear tripped an alarm at a USAF base casing a intruded alert and near scramble. while in another a Soviet Satellite blew up.Sagan, Scott D.: The Limits of Safety , (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, (1993).Edited: left out 1973.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The US has had a number of close calls with nuclear weapons.

(I'm currently writing a book on the subject.)In general, American streetcar systems reached their height in the 1920s, and began to decline thereafter.  This is due to a combination of three factors: (a) the automobile's increasing popularity made many streetcar lines simply uneconomical to operate; (b) most streetcar companies like the Red Cars in Los Angeles or the Key System in the San Francisco Bay Area operated their streetcar systems to promote their real estate developments, and not the other way around, (c) the bus was actually a technological improvement in mixed traffic over the competing streetcar.If you check out my (redrawn) map of Los Angeles's [Pacific Electric streetcar system](_URL_0_) near its height in 1926, there's lots of things that are incredibly unusual to modern eyes.  First, the streetcars go *everywhere.*  You could take a train way out to places which are considered the periphery of Greater LA even in modern times.  These are places like San Bernardino, contemporary population 37,000, or Riverside, population 29,000.  This kind of network is only economically viable if there are literally no other transportation alternatives available.  And the Pacific Electric was infamous for exploiting its transportation monopoly to the limit.  Once the motor bus was invented, and automobile competition arrived in earnest, large-scale abandonment began.  If you check out this [significantly-less-clear map from 1947,](_URL_1_) nearly all passenger service to outlying areas has been abandoned or replaced by buses.You have to remember that the Pacific Electric and similar systems were operated by real estate developers.  The owner of the Pacific Electric, Henry Huntington, was a real estate magnate who made his money by building suburban subdivisions - places like Huntington Beach, Huntington Park and San Marino were all developed by Huntington money.  In the Pacific Electric's case, the streetcar system actually operated at a loss for much of its life, and it was the real estate development that kept the trains running, not the other way around.  (Similarly, in Northern California, the Key System streetcars were actually owned by a company called the \"Realty Syndicate\".)Finally, there's the technological question.  One-car streetcars running in mixed traffic are technologically inferior to diesel buses, because they can't be rerouted for construction, and if something blocks the tracks, there's not much the streetcar driver can do except wait.  In the Pacific Electric's case, many of their routes ran down busy thoroughfares, and they didn't have dedicated lanes the way that the modern L.A. Metro's trains do.  And buses are cheaper to run per-passenger on low-capacity routes - there's no overhead wires or tracks to maintain.  Trains really shine when they have dedicated right-of-way (i.e., their own dedicated lanes or tracks), and it's a high capacity route - a three-car train of streetcars, like the modern Expo Line, can handle 600 passengers per train with a single driver, which is equivalent to five buses.  But one-car trains of streetcars running in mixed traffic have both the disadvantages of a train (can't detour) and the disadvantages of a bus (limited capacity).  Because of this it made a lot of economic sense to abandon streetcars for buses.  GM and National City Lines took advantage of this process to sell buses, but it was a decades-long trend that began long before the alleged conspiracy began in the late 1930s.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The demise of streetcars in the U.S. was due to a conspiracy by GM and other auto manufacturers.

(Whatever its proven or unproven actual psychological underpinnings).However, neither Jentsch nor Freud is talking specifically about dolls in the sense of Bratz or Cabbage Patch Kids. In fact, Jentsch specifically asserts that \"A doll which closes and opens its eyes by itself, or a small automatic toy, will cause no notable sensation of [the uncanny].\" *(trans. Roy Sellars; [PDF](_URL_0_))*. Instead, what he (and to a lesser extent Freud, who simply stipulates Jentsch's point here) circles as the uncanny in terms of mock-humans is automata--that is, \"the life-size machines that perform complicated tasks, blow trumpets, dance and so forth.\" For Jentsch, the uncanny lies in the question of whether something/someone is human or a machine. Critically, this can go in either direction--he identifies the jerking, unconscious movements of a person having a tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure as triggering the sensation of the uncanny in the same way. But his exemplar par excellence, also picked up by Freud, is E.T.A. Hoffmann's short story [*Der Sandmann.*](_URL_2_)From the beginning, in the protagonist's recounting of his childhood nightmare/fever dream/vision/reality, the story blurs the line between human and doll-automaton. Creeptastic Coppelius, the reified \"Sandman\" of Nathanael's childhood terror, seizes the boy in his father's room and treats him like an automaton: >  \"We will examine the mechanism (*Mechanismus*) of his hands and feet.\" >  And then he seized me so roughly that my joints cracked, and screwed off my hands and feet, afterwards putting them back again, one after the other. \"There's something wrong here,\" he mumbled. \"But now it's as good as ever.\"Fast-forwarding in time, Nathanael is engaged to a (genuinely lovely) woman named Clara. However, through the lens of a telescope, he becomes obsessed with another woman named Olimpia--the lens of the telescope being, in a way, artificial/mechanical eyes. Of course the drama of the story is that beautiful, dancing Olimpia, who always responds, \"Ah, ah!\" is actually an automaton.And in the story's finale, when Nathanael and Clara have been reconciled, they go sightseeing one day, observing the land around them from a tower. Clara spots an apparently triffid, and Nathanael wants to take a closer look: >  Nathaniel mechanically put his hand into his breast pocket--he found Coppola's telescope, and pointed it to one side.But before he sees the seemingly-walking shrub, he spots Clara. And his mind flashes back to dancing Olimpia, always through the telescope lens: >  He shrieked out in a piercing tone, \"Spin round, wooden doll! Spin round!\" Then seizing Clara with immense force, he tried to hurl her down, but with the desperate strength of one battling against death she clutched the railings.Clara survives! But in his madness over the confusion of living and doll, Nathanael hurtles himself off the steeple. Throughout the story, then, the boundary between human and machine is repeatedly blurred, right into insanity and death.(Freud thinks the real issue in Hoffmann's story is that eyes are a penis and women don't real, but...you know, *Freud*.)Scholars of Gothic literature in particular have traced this theme of automata as the creepy uncanny, in an age where they were meant first of all to be a wondrous scientific and mechanical achievement, back to the Romantic reaction to the Enlightenment. The idea of the human body as mechanism or machine (an automaton animated by the soul, if you want to be Cartesian about it) runs strongly through the writing of philosophers like La Mettrie. As Hoffmann's story shows, the idea could be inspiring to some, fearsome to others, and most importantly, *both at once*.The theme of human/machine as horror is so prominent in 18th and 19th century Romantic and Gothic literature that Terry Castle even called her anthology of \"greatest hits\" academic articles *The Female Thermometer and the Eighteenth-Century Invention of the Uncanny.* ...Of course, Castle is not a medievalist. And just as the medieval Near East, Byzantium, and (somewhat later) western Europe had both literary and practical traditions of awe-inspiring automata, the era's literature reveals a sense of the uncanny surrounding them.However, as (AskHistorians AMA alumna!) E.R. Truitt points out, the creepy sensation for medieval authors wasn't a question of human and/versus machine. Instead, it was the twilight between life and death. Automata guard tombs, including ones meant to be a direct replication of the deceased; they guard castles populated by spectres. In some stories, automata resembling dead people are employed as a purposeful fraud to pretend the person is still alive.So the overall point is: what is uncanny to the people of one era might not be to those of another, or it might be equally uncanny but for different reasons.As to why some people today find antique dolls creepy, I was unable to find any solid research beyond the usual \"dolls in horror movies\" (fun fact: in the 19th century, it's more often the puppet *masters* who are the bad guys) as well as some info that suggests the phenomenon isn't limited to antique dolls. But this will be quite interesting in light of the above, I think:In Francis McAndrew and Sara Koehnke's study \"On the Nature of Creepiness,\" ([PDF](_URL_1_)) their respondents rated \"collecting something\" as the creepiest hobby--provided that something was \"*dolls*, insects, reptiles, or body parts such as teeth, bones, or fingernails.\" McAndrew and Koehnke identify, overall, creepiness as the sensation of ambiguity over whether something is or isn't a threat. The things that people find creepy to collect are, they point out, either things that humans have an instinctive fear of--snakes and spiders--or things that relate to the living/dead boundary--pulled teeth, clipped fingernails, or outright bones.Or dolls.Our sense of the uncanny, it seems, has more traces of the medieval than one might expect from this side of industrialization and the microchip.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The uncanny valley is a phenomenon that occurs when a person sees a resemblance between a real person and a simulated person.

Also, looking into my source I believe my class really only focused on the painting styles or at least I have a less vivid recollection of the other forms of art and decoration. Much work has been done in Pompeii to look into trends such as those you're after. Within excavated homes there have emerged 4 distinct styles of wall decoration (painting) which show an evolution and stylistic change making them very distinct from one to the next. Looking up a quick chart of reference homes and their dated paints, it appears that these trends stretched from ~175 BCE through the burial of Pompeii in 79 CE. I'd say it roughly breaks down as -Style 1 - 75 or so years in vogue.Style 2 - 120 or so years. Style 3 - 40 or so yearsStyle 4 - 30ish years (or until eruption)These trends and the general evolution of the style was fascinating to me. I highly recommend looking into it further. The gist is that the first style was a trend carried over from Greece in which is was common to build with multi colored marble. Lacking this material, Roman homes would simply paint colors on the wall in either patterns or other patchwork blocks of solitary color. Second style added images to the painting, generally first enhancing the architectural appearance (arches or other flourishes) and extending to adding vistas as if you were looking through the wall into an open space or garden. Realism in depiction was somewhat sought after. The third style took this further and began to frame these images and relegate them into non standard areas of the wall (simply meaning not where you'd expect a window or other opening, often higher up) with other designs or colors implemented lower down. The depictions in the images began to also get more sureal in this phase. Fourth style, I honestly always had trouble distinguishing this one but I believe it was just a more contrasted version of third style, mainly an effort was taken to very much contrast pictorial flourish with the other decoration on the wall, and often blur where the art met the architectural enhancements or other framing. Anyway, I think it is safe to say that it is likely the Empire experienced a similar change of trends as it evolved and time went by. What's interesting to me is it seems this was speeding up in the first century CE though with Pompeii as an example we obviously don't have the long term data to confirm if this trend continues. As I'd imagine much of this decoration was much more work intensive and costly than today, not to mention general technology at the time making it likely much slower for trends to spread, I don't think it odd that it seems ~75-~40 years may have been more in line with the changes in trend.

(I'm also going to stick to only speaking about New Testament apocrypha, as I think that's what you're talking about.)That's not how it happened. (1) Speaking of 'a canon' in the early Church, is, well, a little rough on the early church and it's not clear if it's appropriate. There were a lot more Church writings going around than we now have. It's not clear how early these started to percolate into 'collections', as opposed to 'here's everything we got, boy howdy', but definitely by the time that emperor Constantine asked for 50 bibles there was SOME idea of 'core books'... because if nothing else, his request created a need to identify 'core books'. (2) Debate about the bible lasted for a long time. Some of the Pauline epistles were accepted far later than the rest of the books (more on that below.)(3) 'Orthodoxy' and 'heresy' were pretty fluid in the early centuries of Christianity. Things weren't quite 'settled', so one man's orthodoxy is another's heresy. Bauer is the main proponent of this idea; I also like how Boyarin took that idea and ran with it, arguing that the idea of 'heresy' (specifically in the context of Judeo-Christian relations) was evolving and involved a dialogue. There is evidence of an early consensus on some of the books of the New Testament [because of Irenaeus](_URL_0_), [but even there there is significant variation in the texts of those books](_URL_2_), as this work attempting to figure out the exact source of Irenaeus' bible quotes makes clear. For more on Irenaeus, [this section of Against Heresies has some good quotes](_URL_4_). I especially recommend searching for 'four zones'.So the 'canon' is relatively fixed by 200 AD, because we can see it in Irenaeus' works but is still missing some books (notably, some Pauline Epistles and the Apocalypse of John, the latter of which was rejected by Eusebius). We're not quite sure when it began but the current trend is to view it as a relatively fluid process, instead of one person (Irenaeus/Marcion) laying down the law and saying 'these are the books I trust.' * Books could have never made it in simply because they were written later than 'our' biblical books. The [Acta Pilati/Gospel of Nicodemus may fall into this category](_URL_3_). * They may have been of 'secondary' import, and not directly a testimony on Jesus, so it just wasn't important enough to make the cut. Some of the early works with exalted Mariology or of early saints may fall into this category. They were good, people liked them -- but the New Testament is about the early Church, Jesus, and, weirdly, the end of the world. * It sort of duplicated something already deemd important. The Acts of Paul and Thecla, [while slightly controversial \\(to Tertullian\\)](_URL_1_), might fall into this category. Because Acts already has Paul's entire missionary career (in brief), do we need to include Thecla? * It existed, but was niche (sort of like Thecla, which is really \"let me tell you about the nobility of virginity, at length\") or not well-known. You can't consider something important if you don't know it exists. * It was deemed heretical and, more importantly, stayed heretical. A lot of the works mentioned by Irenaeus fall into this category. * It was deemed non-authentic or of suspect value. The term for this is \"Antilegomena\", and included books that are not in the canon, as well as books that eventually made it into the canon (notably, some Pauline Epistles and the Apocalypse of John/Revelation).

Anheuser-Busch was the first brewery to pasteurize their beer and use refrigerated rail cars to establish a national brand. They were to beer what Gustavus Swift was to meatpacking. The history of national brands really goes hand in hand with that of [advertising](_URL_3_) and there were all kinds of restrictions on ads to make the printed copy appear no more conspicuous than the articles. This starts to evolve after the civil war.It seems like most brands of any type of product were strictly local/regional with the restrictions on print ads in England carrying over to the states. It looks like [Yuengling](_URL_0_) was a regional brewery that also owned the James River Steam Brewing company. James River was owned by the son Yuenling's founder and would have been available to your soldiers at Gettysburg. Prior to refrigeration though you get unrefrigerated steam beers and ales that can be made all year and seasonal lagers that need to be fermented at a lower temperature. Meaning the ability to create consistent beers year round was difficult, lending necessity to a more commodified product. A company would have a number of beers that were made in styles that lent themselves to the fermentibles and climate of the season and the region. German lager needs a cold and consistent temperature. Ale is less delicate in the fermentation process. A bitter/hoppier ale can stand up to unusual flavors that might develop from heat for example which is why the English had India Pale Ale for the long voyage to bring beer to the expats on the subcontinent. Steam beers were essentially a hack of the process that allowed for the use of lager yeast at higher temperatures. In many ways these steam beers were and attempt to make a crisper more consistent lager beer year round. Ironic that it would be one of the beers available in Virginia, the only other notable steam brewery was Anchor in San Francisco. Ironic too that Civil War veterans like Adolphus Busch would come back from the war to develop a national brand. Prior to this you get a product that was less likely to draw attention just for the beer itself. Before the Civil War it was very hard to do quality control too because kegs were the main way beer could be distributed. Meaning that they had little to no control over how a beer would be sold so that the beer of one brand could be switched out and offered under the name of another company. This led to bottle beer and vertical integration (breweries owning the network of taverns that sold their beer), all of which come after the Civil War. Circling back around to the British their [first registered trademark](_URL_2_) is the red triangle of Bass Ale and that was introduced in, 1870. So while Lowenbrau and Stella Artois claim to have been registered in the 15th century, the trend of offering a distinct \"brand\" doesn't seem to really kick into gear until after the American Civil War. Meaning that while the soldiers at Gettysburg were likely able to get themselves a beer brewed by a Yuengling it was unlikely that they took much interest in that fact.

He moved warheads close to the operational missile sites and pushed his crews to finish readying the R-14s and Il-28s.On October 26, Pliyev told Moscow that if the Americans attacked he would use \"all available means of air defense.\" Khrushchev OKed this. However, the Kremlin reiterated that Pliyev should not mate nuclear warheads with his operational cruise missiles or R-12s without specific authorization. That night, Pliyev ordered a battery of cruise missiles set up 15 miles from Guantanamo Bay, where 5,000 Marines were stationed. Thousands of other U.S. troops were hovering just outside Cuba's territorial waters, where they were sitting ducks for other cruise missiles. On October 27, one of Pliyev's antiaircraft crews shot down a U-2 without Pliyev's okay. That same day, Captain Valentin Savitsky of the Soviet sub B-59 cracked under the pressure of harassment by U.S. warships, who were dropping practice depth charges on his sub. Savitsky ordered his nuclear torpedoes loaded. \"We're going to blast them now! We will die, but we will sink them all!\" His second, Vasili Archipov, calmed him down and probably saved a billion lives.The next day, the Kremlin sent Pliyev new orders, allowing him to deploy any means of defense he wanted. Orders about the nukes were ambiguous - but Khrushchev told him not to shoot down any more planes later that day. On October 29, Pliyev was ordered to shut down his missile sites and the next day he was ordered to pack up all his warheads for return to the USSR.The nuclear torpedoes on the B-59 were ready to fire within minutes. The FKR missiles could be targeted, mated, and fueled within a half-hour, while the R-12s could have been ready within an hour of the go order.**EDIT: A clarification here.***A \"cold\" launch would require more like three hours. However, Pliyev was on high alert, as evidenced by the preparation and positioning of warheads. A fully fueled and prepped R-12 could be launched as quickly as five minutes after the order was given. Please note that while Khrushchev ordered Pliyev not to mate warheads, fueling and targeting were not forbidden.*Documents of the time indicate that the U.S. had a good map of the R-12 sites *but* did not recognize the scale of the FKR threat, and estimated Soviet numbers in Cuba at around 10,000 - so it's likely they would have attempted an invasion backed by saturation airstrikes at the R-12 launch sites. A half-hour into the war, the FKRs would fly and that would end just about everything.[About the B-59 and the naval confrontations in general](_URL_0_)[A good encyclopedia for quick reference](_URL_1_)I recommend Sheldon Stern's *The Week The World Stood Still*, Aleksandr Fursenko and Timothy Naftali's *One Hell of a Gamble*, and Michael Dobbs' *One Minute to Midnight*.**ANOTHER EDIT:** With the exception of Guantanamo, Western sources still don't have a *definitive* answer to the \"Soviet target list\" question.

People still took the trouble to seek out private moments, such as the times when lord and lady lay curtained off in their four-poster bed, or when a courting couple walked out into the woods in merry Maytime, or when a person knelt in prayer in an oratory. >  Nor was sex restricted to the bedroom. Edmund Harrold, a priapic wig-maker living in late-Stuart Manchester, kept a detailed diary of his sex life, including comments such as \u2018did wife 2 tymes couch  &  bed in an hour an[d] \u00bd time\u2019. In 1763, James Boswell exceeded him with a clever actress/prostitute named Louisa: \u2018a more voluptuous night I never enjoyed. Five times was I fairly lost in rapture \u2026 I was somewhat proud of my performance.\u2019 On this occasion they were in a bed, but it\u2019s only fair to point out that the lanes and fields were far more attractive to medieval and Tudor young people who lived in otherwise communal spaces. The fact that early bedrooms were shared could certainly inhibit romance. The seventeenth-century Abigail Willey of Oyster River, New England, would stop her husband \u2018coming to her\u2019 when she didn\u2019t feel like it by making her two children sleep in the middle of the bed rather than taking their usual position at the sides. > The chivalric cult had a strange parallel in the sleeping arrangement known as \u2018bundling\u2019, which was common both to rural areas of seventeenth-century Wales and to eighteenth-century New England. This was likewise a non-sexual relationship, where a young man and woman passed the night alone in a bedroom together, but remained fully clothed. Sometimes they were even tied down or a board was placed down the middle of their bed. The idea was to make it through to morning without having sex, in order to find out whether they got on well enough together to marry. Until 1800, when it began to arouse a new moralistic disapproval, to \u2018bundle\u2019 was considered both chaste and sensible as it led to more successful marriages:  > Cate Nance and Sue proved just and true  > Tho\u2019 bundling did practise;  > But Ruth beguil\u2019d and proved with child, > Who bundling did despise.  > The other explanation for this curious custom can be found in the architectural design of pre-modern rural cottages. Obviously, in an age when houses contained far fewer rooms than there were family members, the young people were short of private places in which to become acquainted. It was a kindness on the part of a girl\u2019s parents to leave a young couple alone together in the upstairs bedchamber, the rest of the family gathering in the kitchen or parlour below instead. The ropes and the board assuaged the parents\u2019 conscience, as they were responsible for finding their daughter a suitable husband, yet also for preserving her virginity. On the other hand, pre-marital sex was not seen as disastrous for people of the middling or lower sort, and a pre-marital pregnancy could be welcome proof of fertility. \u2018You would not buy a horse without trying it first,\u2019 explained one Norfolk farmer to his vicar.

The U.S. devoted considerable resources both during and after WWII to maintaining the UK. This included lend-lease aid, eventually direct military support, and the Marshall Plan following the war. As a parallel point, the U.S. also devoted considerable aid to France following the war as well. In July 1950, in exchange for France allowing West Germany into NATO, the U.S. provided \"substantial military aid\" to French forces fighting in SE Asia. The point I'm trying to make here is: why would the U.S. deliberately try to fell British influence while enhancing French? In any case, as I'm sure you're aware, it wasn't enough. In 1954, the U.S. gave up support because the French couldn't win the war. Then, in a fit of geopolitical genius (/s), America shortly afterwards got itself into exactly the same problem the French had and received the same result.     Now can you dig around and find some document from some member of the US government from 1926 speculating on the fall of Britain and how America could take advantage? Probably. But that's not why it happened. What i'm getting at with all this is that the fall of the European empires following World War II was not because of the United States. They were simply too expensive to maintain at a time that Europe was struggling to provide for itself. The people that were ruled by Europe were not oblivious to this fact and took advantage to throw off the yoke.Source:Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945 by Tony Judt", "label": 0}, {"content": "The US was a staunch ally of Britain during the war.

Many anecdotes do involve \"speaking truth to power,\" but usually moderated by the jester's ongoing attempt to remain both useful to the monarch on the one hand, and alive and employed on the other. Sometimes this attempt fails spectacularly, as when Archy Archibald, jester to James I of England and by all accounts not very good at his job, told him that he thought the Prince of Wales was more popular with the common people; the ensuing father-son quarrel resulted in Archy being \"tossed in a blanket 'like a dog'\" by the Prince and his friends. (Archy was later fired by James' successor, Charles I, for accidentally revealing sensitive political information in one of his offhand remarks.)In general, court jesters provided many benefits to their monarchs. A monarch with a court jester might be more likely to be perceived as close to the common people (due to the people's enjoyment of comedy), wealthy and powerful (due to the luxury of having a jester at all, and the jester's ability to skewer nobles or the church or anyone else while under the monarch's protection), and also magnanimous and forgiving (if the jester was able to poke at least mild fun at the monarch without having to fear execution or banishment). Having a jester also contributed to at least the perception that a ruler was not surrounded by yes-men; Elizabeth I allegedly rebuked one of her fools for being insufficiently severe with her.But did they ever actually serve as advisors, dispensing pearls of wisdom from an unexpected quarter? Regarding your actual question, it sounds like you're specifically looking for stories where two things are true: 1) the jester is \"speaking truth to power,\" and 2) the monarch learns about or changes their mind about something important. There are plenty of examples where one or the other is true, but after doing a bit of digging, I haven't yet been able to find a clear example where both are true.There are many anecdotal examples of jesters successfully convincing a monarch to hire or reward them, and/or not to punish them, on the basis of pure comedy. Here are two from *Fools Are Everywhere: The Court Jester Around the World* by Beatrice K. Otto: > Tenali Rama, one of the three superstar jesters of India, is said to have earned his position as jester by making King Krsnadevaraya laugh. According to one story, he contrived for the king's guru to carry him around on his shoulders within sight of the king. Outraged at the humiliation of his holy man, the king sent some guards out to beat the man riding on the guru's shoulders. Tenali Rama, smelling impending danger, jumped down and begged forgiveness of the guru, insisting that to make amends he should carry him on his own shoulders. The guru agreed, and when the guards arrived the guru was duly beaten. The king found the trick amusing enough to appoint Tenali Rama his jester.... > On one occasion [Emperor Zhuangzong of China] was fooling around with a group of entertainers, and \"looking all around him he said, 'Son of Heaven Li! Where's Son of Heaven Li?'\u2014referring to himself. [His jester] Newly Polished Mirror rushed forward and slapped him across the face. Zhaungzong turned ashen, and the courtiers were all terrified. The crowd of entertainers, also panic-stricken, seized the jester and asked, 'Just what d'you think you're playing at, slapping the Son of Heaven in the face?' Newly Polished Mirror, feigning innocence, explained, 'But there is only one Son of Heaven Li, so who was asking for him?' Thereupon the courtiers all laughed. Zhuangzong was delighted and rewarded Newly Polished generously.\"There are also many examples where jesters are alleged to have spoken truth (of a political nature) to power in a fairly surprising or shocking way, but not necessarily effecting any change in their monarch. In some particularly bold cases, I would wonder if these were popular jokes that were attributed to brazen jesters, but never actually spoken by them. Here's one from from the 19th-century *History of Court Fools*, by John Doran, about Charles the Bold's jester, Le Glorieux: > Le Glorieux was a facetious fellow, and as fearless as facetious. His master, Duke Charles, used to compare himself with Hannibal. After the overthrow at Granson, Duke and fool were galloping in search of safety, with many others. The Duke was in gloomy wrath, Le Glorieux was full of wicked gaiety. \"Uncle,\" cried he to Charles, \"this is the prettiest way of being like Hannibal that I ever saw.\"And another from *Fools Are Everywhere*, attributed to Will Somers, fool to Henry VIII: > His Majesty after some discourse growing into some good liking of him, said; fellow, wilt thou be my fool? who answered him again, that he had rather be his own father's still, then the king asking him why? he told him again, that his father had got him a fool for himself, (having but one wife) and no body could justly claim him from him: now you have had so many wives, and still living in hope to have more, why, of some one of them, cannot you get a fool as he did? and so you shall be sure to have a fool of your own.Additional sources:* Vicki K.

The first is that the idea of violence in the American West is very different in reality than it is as portrayed in popular media. I've written elsewhere about the most popular visual representation of this, the 'duel at high noon', which is almost entirely absent from the historical record despite being the climactic showdown of countless dime novels and films, but looking more broadly too, while that isn't to say the West *wasn't* violent, it certainly wasn't lawless. Historiography since the 1970s or so has mostly pushed back against the idea of the \"Wild, Wild West\", even if the public mind hasn't, and continues to relish the image. In any case though, body counts get exaggerated in the retelling, and that is assuming the best of intentions. Much of Dodge City's infamous reputation was created from whole cloth by Stuart Lake who did a supposedly \"as-told-to\" autiobiography of Wyatt Earp which quotes liberally from primary sources that never existed to describe dozens of deaths that never happened, while in reality its \"wild days\" were limited to the first year or so of settlement. Similarly Montana Territory was claimed to have over 100 murders by the editor Thomas Dimsdale, but the reality is often much duller. Scholarly assessment of the period substantiates eight in that time frame. Similarly, take a place such as Deadwood, a well known locale for its lack of any actual law enforcement during its initial settlement and most famously represented in the show of the same name... which only experienced 4 murders in that first year of settlement-without-law enforcement - possibly less than a single episode of the show, although it has been ages since I watched it. Returning to Dodge city though, when one year the city experienced a total of 5 murders, this was heralded as a \"civic disaster\", the highest total the city experienced aside from its first year of habitation in 1872 when the entirety of its wild reputation was earned, with slightly over a dozen homicides of all types (murder, self-defense, manslaughter).Now to be sure, looking at raw numbers tells only half the tale, and it is homicide rates can tell us another side. 5 deaths in a population of 600 is a much bigger deal than a population of 6 million, after all, but as they say, it is pretty easy to lie with statistics. If I told you that the homicide rate in Dodge City was 100.4 per 100,000 (the US was 5.3 per 100,000 in 2016 for comparison) in 1880, that would seem shocking... but if I told you a single person was murdered that year, it would seem considerably less so! The population that year was only 996, and the death of Henry Heck at the hands of John Gill was the sole difference between a murder rate of 0 and 100. This is quite important in understanding how murder was viewed in the period, as the difference in *rates* seems high, but was likely quite unconcerning to the population when it was a difference of only one, two, or maybe three people.Now to be sure, this doesn't exactly answer your question, but I preface all of this to say that when we are talking about murder in the American West, we're talking about very small numbers. A sheriff in many towns might never even have to draw his gun in his career, and even in a \"violent\" place like Dodge City, the coroner was being called out a few times per year. Lawmen would be much more likely to be hunting down horse thieves and cattle rustlers, which happened at a great deal high rate. Dykstra's \"Quantifying the Wild West\" and \"To Live and Die in Dodge City\" are both useful for a good deal more statistical analysis stuff, which is interesting, but not what we need to dive into here.Now, let us say that someone has been murdered. The location isn't terribly important, but let's follow the case of Lincoln County, Nebraska as that is what I have sources on, although this is really quite equally applicable to most settled areas, lawmen and legal systems being present and generally followed in any town or city of any noticeable size. Anyways, for starters, often the sheriff or his deputies needed to do next to nothing when someone was killed, not because of the evidence, but because they would turn themselves in. Claims of justification or self-defense were fairly common, the law about it permissive, and assuming prosecutors even thought to go through with it, juries were not unsympathetic. In the strange perspective of the West, murder wasn't even seen as the worst crime - horse thieves often enjoyed worse sentences - and *how* one dealt with the killing, presenting their actions as honorable and correct, could go a long way. Will Hale, for instance, murdered several people in 1870s Texas, the first a man who hat been cheating at cards, and then following that his brothers when they attempted to exact their revenge. The first killing was likely unjustified by the law, but prosecutors didn't feel it worth going after, and the latter ones were considered self-defense so given a pass as well.Especially if there were no witnesses, a homicide committed in private could be presented as the killer was able to justify it, but even with several, if the victim 'had it coming' prosecutorial discretion would often let it slide and leave many murders unindicted. Only a total of four murders in Lincoln County during the 1870-1900 period actually proved to require real investigation by law enforcement, lacking witnesses to name a suspect, and these perhaps speak to the core of your question here.The most interesting case is that of the murder of Kate Manning, killed at her land claim in 1871, a very clear execution by single gunshot. A sheriff and deputy were called and found footprints which they took plaster molds of. Comparison with suspects showed that her own brother, Peter, matched due to a deformity of the foot and he was brought to trial. What is important here is that he was found not guilty. Maintaining his innocence, we can easily presume that the jury didn't find a brother visiting his sister to be compelling enough evidence to go beyond 'reasonable doubt', although my efforts to find the trial documents for State v. Manning failed so we can't say for certain (Records are [here](_URL_0_) just presumably not digitized). In 1871, Loyal Bly was found murdered but a lack of an clues at the scene meant there was nothing to go on. A more successful case, regarding the death of a cowboy, was solved when the murderer turned out to be a fellow cowboy he had worked with and not gotten along with.To in short there, how would you get away with murder in the \"Wild West\"? Don't have any witnesses, and don't be the person with the most motive. Circumstantial evidence could, at least in the case of Manning, be explained away, and if there was nothing at the scene of the crime at all, it would likely be a dead end for investigation, especially lacking modern forensics. Lacking clues the only real avenue was checking to see \"Who might have wanted them dead?\" and if you weren't that person, you probably could get away with it scott free. A side note of course can be made here, namely that the courts themselves and the court of public opinion were different beasts. Attempts to lynch suspects before trials were not unheard of, especially if the victim was popular, young, or female. Manning was nearly subjected to one for instance, and it was common to move the venue of a trial, both for the safety of the accused lest a mob conspire to take him, and also to ensure a more impartial jury. So in any case, the point here is that even if you might be \"Not Guilty\" by standards of the court, being caught at all could have its dangers no matter your confidence in acquittal. But the larger picture, really, should be that murders weren't that common, and real \"Who Dunnits\" were quite few and far between.**Sources**Dykstra, Robert R. \"Quantifying the Wild West: The Problematic Statistics of Frontier Violence\" *Western Historical Quarterly* 40 (Autumn 2009): 321-347-- \"To Live and Die in Dodge City: Body Counts, Law and Order, and the Case of Kansas v.

Aristotle also mentions dieting in his discussion of the mean, stating that while a person can eat between one and nine pounds of food Milo (the paragon of ancient athletes)  should eat six -- that the mean is good but the goodness of the mean is relative to other factors and not just the bare average of the numbers.I don't remember what the quote was from our about (it was likely an ancient taking about how things worked in Sparta) but I remember reading that it either was or should be codified in an ideal city that men not productively married (so, with kids) by a certain age should be forced to spend their days near the gymnasium.

Augustus expanded the Commander's Cohort (cohors praetoria) of personally commanded troops into nine cohorts of around 500-1000 men each, which were stationed not in the Emperor's private residence, but in and around the city environs in order to secure the Emperor's control of Rome itself. The traditional taboo regarding having armed troops regularly stationed in the City was still somewhat of a factor, so to avoid being obvious the Praetorians were usually dressed in civilian clothes and may have had their swords concealed - though this is unclear. Augustus also created three supplementary *Cohors Urbanes*, which were not as privileged as the Praetorians, but often considered as performing the same role. The Praetorians as a whole were not Imperial bodyguards therefore but a military police force who kept order and control over a city of over a million people, as well as arresting and liquidating political opponents, assasinating rivals, and being sent out on punitive or policing missions into the countryside. The level of state control here is impressive. Augustus had instituted a regime that policed the city with a force of around 1 per 100 citizens. This is huge even when compared to modern police forces; in 1998 New York city had only 1 per 190 citizens. Only in the last decade has modern police forces reached this number again. The instability of the Imperial control can be seen by the gradual increase of these numbers to reach a ratio of one military policeman for every 42 civilians by the reign of Septimus Severus at the beginning of the third century (including *vigiles* and *urbanes*).This was a powerful organ of state control but needed to be kept sweet. Tiberius ensured every ordinary soldier was given 300 sesterces on his ascension; but every Praetorian got a thousand. They were commanded by two Prefects from 2 BC who gradually gathered more and more power to themselves until by the end of the third century they had practically become assistant Emperors.The defence of the Emperor's person was not therefore the direct or main responsibility of the Praetorian Guards, but of various other groups. One of which was the traditional Lictors, though considering they were armed only with bundles of twigs they usually quickly disappeared as soon as things got hairy. Personal protection could be an ad hoc affair as Augustus relied on a temporary group of ten friends to protect him during a particularly tense meeting of the senate where he had them standing nearby when each senator was searched for weapons. But Augustus more commonly protected himself in public with a special element of his military guard called the *speculatores* who had long lances which they protected him with, pushing the crowd out of the way. But in addition to these functionaries, one of the most well known and effective groups in an emergency were the *Germani corporis custodes*, or German Bodyguards, recruited from un-romanized areas. These aren't as famous as the Praetorians, but were actually the guys who protected the Emperor when things got nasty, and groups were attached to both the Emperor himself, as well as members of his family. They were disbanded by Galba, and Suetonius criticised him for it, since \u201cthey had been extremely faithful to previous emperors amid many trying experiences.\u201d Not only did they help protect the Emperor's person, according to Josephus they were the first to detect Caligula's murder and the most eager to avenge it.After Galba's disbanding of the Germans, Emperors likely relied more on the *speculatores* for personal protection. Later Trajan, or one of the Flavians, created a special horse guard called the *equites singulares Augusti*, which were doubled to two thousand under Septimus Severus. These were apparently so similar to the earlier Germans that they shared the same nickname *Batavi*.I'm sorry I haven't answered your question directly. I couldn't find any details in my source regarding specific assasination plots that were foiled by these bodyguards. But perhaps this information will help further research.Source: *Policing the Roman Empire*, Christopher Fuhrmann, 2012, Oxford University Press", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Praetorian Guard was a military unit of the Roman Empire.

These conditions would have been ripe for an algal bloom and the subsequent infestations of frogs, lice, and flies. Some scholars have used this evidence to suggest the biblical plagues were based on actual events. > Professor Augusto Magini, a paleoclimatologist at Heidelberg University's institute for environmental physics, said: \"Pharaoh Rameses II reigned during a very favourable climatic period. > \"There was plenty of rain and his country flourished. However, this wet period only lasted a few decades.  > After Rameses' reign, the climate curve goes sharply downwards. > \"There is a dry period which would certainly have had serious consequences.\" > The scientists believe this switch in the climate was the trigger for the first of the plagues. The rising temperatures could have caused the river Nile to dry up, turning the fast flowing river that was Egypt's lifeline into a slow moving and muddy watercourse. These conditions would have been perfect for the arrival of the first plague, which in the Bible is described as the Nile turning to blood. > Dr Stephan Pflugmacher, a biologist at the Leibniz Institute for Water Ecology and Inland Fisheries in Berlin, believes this description could have been the result of a toxic fresh water algae. He said the bacterium, known as Burgundy Blood algae or Oscillatoria rubescens, is known to have existed 3,000 years ago and still causes similar effects today. > He said: \"It multiplies massively in slow-moving warm waters with high levels of nutrition.

The arrival of the toxic algae would have triggered such a transformation and forced the frogs to leave the water where they lived. But as the frogs died, it would have meant that mosquitoes, flies and other insects would have flourished without the predators to keep their numbers under control.[Source](_URL_0_)These scientific explanations are not conclusive, and it's quite possible that the plagues are literary imaginings of catastrophes feared by any agrarian society. Turning to Egyptian sources for comparative material, many of the plagues have parallels. The imagery of the Nile turning into blood as a result of political unrest, the first plague, is known from the *Admonitions of Ipuwer*, a Middle Kingdom text preserved in a New Kingdom copy. > Lo, the river is blood > As one drinks of it, one shrinks from people  > And thirsts for water.*Ipuwer* also mentions the death of children (compare to the 10th plague) > Lo, great and small (say), \"I wish I were dead\" >  Little children say, \"He should not have made me live!\" > Lo, children of nobles are dashed against walls, > Infants are put out on high ground.and complaints of cattle (compare to the 5th plague). > Lo, all beasts, their hearts weep, > Cattle bemoan the state of the land.Such doom-and-gloom pieces, which claim that various catastrophes and social upheavals occurred during times of political decentralization, are not uncommon in Egyptian literature. The *Prophecy of Neferti*, for example, discusses the withdrawal of Re and a darkening of Egypt as a consequence of political instability, which one can compare to the 9th plague of darkness.  > Re will withdraw from mankind: > Though he will rise at his hour, > One will not know when noon has come; > No one will discern his shadow, > No face will be dazzled by seeing him,  > No eyes will moisten with water.The *Complaints of Khakheperresoneb* contains a similarly mournful account of recent events.  > I meditate on what has happened,  > The events that occur throughout the land:  > Changes take place, it is not like last year,  > One year is more irksome than the other.  > The land breaks up, is destroyed, > Becomes a wasteland.These works of literature were created by the elite for elite consumption and reflect a political-propagandistic aim by contrasting the (supposed) sorry state of affairs without a unifying king to the strong, centralized government and prosperous Egypt of the Middle and New Kingdoms. As for a proliferation of frogs, they would have been a rather irritating nuisance -- but only a nuisance. Frogs are neither dangerous nor destructive, but their noise and invasiveness would have been irritating. The passage notes the frogs crawled into bedrooms, into kitchens, and even into ovens, the last place you'd expect to find a frog. Accounts of animals invading homes are quite common in ancient Near Eastern literature, unsurprisingly nearly always a negative event. Tablet 44 of the *\u0160umma alu* omen series, for example, contains omens for the actions of wild animals. > If a fox enters a man\u2019s house, the hand (of a god) will affect that house. An Old Babylonian letter contains a more frightening example, a lion stuck in the upper room of a house. > A short time ago I wrote to my lord as follows: \"A lion was caught in the loft of a house in Akkaka. My lord should write me whether this lion should remain in that same loft until the arrival of my lord, or whether I should have it brought to my lord.\" But letters from my lord were slow in coming and the lion has been in the loft for five days. Although they threw him a dog and a pig, he refused to eat them. I was worrying, \"Heaven forbid that this lion pine away.\" I became scared, but eventually I got the lion into a wooden cage and loaded it on a boat to have it brought to my lord.As a final example, animals were perceived as agents of impurity, which would have been a particular vexation for temples and palaces, where ritual purity was strictly regulated. The Hittite \"Instruction for Temple Personnel\" outlines the consequences of tolerating a pig or dog in the kitchen.  > If a pig or dog touches the wooden utensils or the ceramic wares that you have, but the kitchen foreman does not throw them out, then the deities will give him feces and urine to eat and drink.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The plague of frogs was a symbolic attack on the Egyptians.

Genghis Khan at the beginning of his conquest (after uniting the Mongol nation in approximately 1206) appointed 97 Minghaan officers. These were in charge of 1000 men each. 10 minghaans made up a tumen, these were large forces that could be sent off by Genghis independently due to their competent commander. Each minghaan would have 10 jaghun commanders commanding 100 men, these were appointed by the minghaan leader. Within a jaghun there would be units of 10 (arbans) who would each elect their own leader. An arban would ideally be self sufficient, so had to carry supplies and shelter for 10 men. This decimal system was not revolutionary from Genghis Khan as it had been used before, but not on such a scale. As each commander had to pass orders onto only ten men it meant that there was a fluid command structure during battle. Even down to the lowest arban, commanders were expected to show initiative and had some freedom to carry out objectives. That was the basic Mongol military structure, obviously each unit was rarely actually totally full, Tumens that would in theory have 10 thousand men would more likely contain around 6,000-8,000. Genghis was renowned for his meritocratic structure whereby birthright was influential, but a simple tribesman with no noble blood (Subedei) ended up being effectively supreme commander. Promotions were based very much on skill and this helped to propel the 'Horde' forward.

Carthage was originally a Phoenician colony, but while it inherited many of the characteristics of the Phoenicians, it developed its own personality in the Hellenistic era. Carthage had several advantages that gave it strength: its efficient exploitation of agricultural and natural resources, its network of trading posts throughout the Mediterranean, and its extremely strong navy. I\u2019ll begin by telling Carthage\u2019s story, but mainly relying on archaeological sources instead of literature sources. One of the hardest things to study about Carthage is how the biases and mistellings of their history by the Greeks and Romans. Carthage was founded sometime between 1200 and 800 BCE by the Phoenicians, as one of their many Mediterranean colonies (archaeology suggests around 814, literature suggests earlier). The Phoenician MO was to set up a trading post on a coastal bar parallel to the mainland, and then establish a few buildings like a temple, mint, and a port for exporting (it\u2019s like a Civ game!). While these colonies were mostly just for producing raw materials, eventually Carthage was one of the few colonies to become a full fledged city. Around 550 BCE, the Phoenician empire was defeated by the neo-Babylonians, and Carthage lost contact with the homeland of Tyre. This marks the beginning of the Punic period. Before about 650 BCE, Carthage was a small city that stretched a few hundred meters from the sea to Byrsa (_URL_3_) (_URL_2_), the hill where the city was allegedly founded. Around Byrsa was a ring of workshops, where metalworkers, fullers, dyers, and potters would work downwind of everyone else. We even know that there is a parking lot that has been an empty plot of land for 3000 years! After 650 BCE, there was a housing explosion and the city had to be reorganized, moving the tombs around and expanding the city outwards \u2013 pushing the workshops into the necropolis and the necropolis outside the city. On an agricultural level, some of what the Carthaginians surpassed the Romans, but while Mago\u2019s works on agriculture were renowned throughout the ancient world, they have been lost to time. Eventually, Carthage developed its incredibly strong navy and began expanding around the Mediterranean. They built this beautiful harbor (_URL_4_) (_URL_0_), with places for both civilian and military ships, and their naval expeditions reached far south into Africa. Carthaginian ships were named for the number of decks, so a bireme would have 2 decks of rowers while a trireme would have three decks. They even got up to quinqueremes! People could row the ship below while soldiers fought on top. During a time period when the Egyptians and Etruscans were lacing their ships together with rope, the Carthaginians used mortar and tendon construction to make more durable ships. This allowed them to set up colonies all along North Africa, Spain, and islands in the middle of the Mediterranean. Politically, we know very little about how Carthage worked. It had some republican attributes, as we know there was a Senate and a Court of 104, we just aren\u2019t sure what those were. There were also 2 suffettes who led the government for a year long term, similar to the Roman consuls, and were chosen by merit. However, all of the sources for the Carthaginian government come from Greco-Roman interpretation, so it is hard to be sure. There also is evidence that the government was mainly an oligarchy, which is unsurprising considering that Carthage was built off of trade and money, not conquest. This sets the stage for Carthage going into the Punic wars: a superpower in the Mediterranean, with many colonies, a strong navy, and an advanced economy and political structure. Eventually, they clashed with Rome over some minor disputes, repeatedly, until the end of the second Punic war, which began a whole new period for Carthage. What I consider so incredible about Carthage, and Hannibal in particular, is that he managed to pivot the city from a devastating war to an economic powerhouse in such a short time period. The reason for the third Punic War was that Rome was afraid of just how powerful Carthage could become, not how powerful they actually were. After Carthage was defeated in 202 BCE, Hannibal was elected suffette in 196 BCE, and began reforming the city. There was a great intensification of agriculture, particularly valuable olive oil, which Carthage then sold around the Mediterranean for a massive profit. Hannibal also focused on improving the lives and political power of the middle class in the city, by raising taxes on the rich and gifting political clout to every day people. For example, this inscription called the \u201cAvenue de la Republique inscription\u201d (_URL_1_) attests the new main street to the common tradesmen and workers who built the roads. Making this new road was also a part of the new city planning, with standardized blocks, drainage systems, and apartments: Appian claimed that they reached up to 6 stories (!). Despite the massive reparations, and the loss of land, and the loss of prestige and manpower, Carthage still managed to rise back up as a civil power. Unfortunately, Rome does not tolerate a challenge, and without the military power to defend itself Carthage was burned to the ground by Rome. The earth was not salted, but Rome left it for a hundred years to sulk before repopulating the city. Even then, Carthage rose up to become an important Roman colony and produced several emperors, but the true Carthage was obliterated after the third Punic War.

What's interesting about that top entry is that you can see that the starboard (\"steorbord\") is opposed here to \"b\u00e6cbord,\" or back-board; by the time we get to Middle English, \"laddeborde\" has supplanted \"b\u00e6cbord\" and will slowly drift into \"larboard\":  >  c1400  (\u25b8?c1380)    *Patience* l. 106   \u00deay layden in on laddeborde  &  \u00fee lofe wynnes. >  1495   in M.

The word \"port\" starts being used in opposition to \"starboard\" around the Tudor era.

It is first important to note that it was never total and it happened at different times in different places.

The barrel became a \"competitor\" to the amphora, and perhaps even the dominant form of transport, starting sometime in the early imperial period, perhaps in the second century, and they were certainly common by Late Antiquity.The problem is that we have no way of producing a quantified comparison. Literary evidence is unhelpful, as it rarely mentions things like shipping containers (to give an idea, when was the last time you talked about shipping crates?). Archaeology, on the other hand, is biased towards what survives in the material record, and in this case amphora survive considerably better that wooden barrels, which can only do so in specific conditions.So broadly speaking barrels became a common for of transport during the early imperial period, particularly in the wood rich northern provinces.

Having - unfortunately - written on this before, I\u2019ve adapted and expanded on previous writings here.In short, claims about Hitler\u2019s \u2018abnormal\u2019 sexuality are well known, but also quite varied, for the most part based on rumor and innuendo rather than anything approaching reasonable suspicion, let alone documented fact. Hitler himself left us essentially nothing in his writings or known sayings that give us an real clues, and while many such as Kershaw have called him an \u2018unperson\u2019 for the lack of personal life, this is truer with his sexual life then almost any other facet of who he was, forcing us to rely entirely on the words and observations of others, which unfortunately vary in their credibility from the possible to the ludicrous.Looking to August Kubizek, one of the few friends that Hitler had in during his late teens/early 20s, and his roommate in 1908, in his writings on Hitler, Kubizek recollected that he would talk about sex endlessly during many evening chats, particularly \u201c*on the need for sexual purity to protect what he grandly called the 'flame of life\u2019*\u201d. He also would rant about sexual \"depravity\" in general, having plenty to say about prostitutes - members of the German race had no business risking disease with them, prostitutes we only for the \"inferior races\" - and homosexuals as well. He had an 'idealized' love, \"Stephanie\" while a boy in Linz, but it was purely a love from afar and he never told her. According to Kershaw, examining all the evidence, at the very least we can safely assume Hitler had no sexual experience through his mid-20s, as there is simply no evidence of a woman in his life, and the one account of him resorting to prostitutes is \"baseless\". During the war, his apparent lack of sexual interest was one means his comrades poked fun at him, once asking if he was using time in the rear to *\u201clook for a Mamsell\u201d*, to which he replied *\u201dI\u2019d die of shame looking for sex with a French girl\u201d.*Broadly speaking, the claims about Hitler\u2019s sexuality can be boiled down into three categories, none of which are mutually exclusive per se. The first is claims of homosexuality, which of course I don\u2019t want to ascribe as not \u201cnormal\u201d given the question asked here, but past authors have certainly portrayed it as such (Shirer, although not implicating Hitler directly, lumps in the \u201chomosexual perverts\u201d with murders as both being common in the Nazi hierarchy, for instance). The second is a penchant for sadomasochistic, submissive, or otherwise \"perverted\" behavior, and the final one, of course, centers on his possible relation to Geli Raubal, his young niece who committed suicide.The last one is perhaps the most famous, given the salacious incest angle, not to mention that it was by far the most public and plausible, and while as Kershaw notes in his work on Hitler the *emotional* relationship was most likely the closest thing Hitler had to being \"emotionally dependent on a woman\u201d, we simply lack clear evidence to conclusively state the relationship was sexual, whatever the rumormongers insinuated, even if many authors such as Shirer ascribe it as absolute fact. More broadly, what few relations, including Geli, that Hitler was known to have demonstrate something of a pattern, causing many to argue that he was less interested in sex than in power, associating himself with women decades younger than himself and notably impressionable - Maria Reiter was 21 years younger, Geli Raubal 19, and Eva Braun 23 years younger. Eva Braun, who was his companion for the longest span, was often noted by observers for her lack of intelligent conversation and apparently vapid demeanor, something which apparently made her company most enjoyable to Hitler. His photographer, for whom she had originally worked, wrote of the relationship that: > To him she was just an attractive little thing, in whom, in spite of her inconsequential and feather-brained outlook - or perhaps just because of it - he found the type of relaxation and repose he sought. But never, in voice, look, or gesture, did he ever behave in a way that suggested any deeper interest in her. The claim can be taken even further when we address Putzi Hanfstaengl\u2019s opinion of Hitler, believing that he was simply impotent, and further that public speaking was essentially a replacement sexual act for him, exercising his power over the entire crowd. Of course, Putzi also related that Hitler had once professed his undying love forhis wife Helene, but both agreed it was less based on sexual attraction than Hitler\u2019s \"acting out a role [of the] languishing troubadour\u201d. Putzi, of course, must be taken with a grain or two of salt. Of German and American parentage, he had soured on Nazism in the mid-30s, and left Germany, eventually ending up in the US where he provided information about the personal life of Hitler and other Nazi officials during the war. Putzi spun many tales, and is one of the sources of the more serious rumors - and lack of consistency - about Hitler, including allegations that he had engaged in sex with men during his time in Vienna, and also insinuating a relationship between Hitler and Rudolf Hess. Shirer relied on Putzi for much of his scuttlebutt on Hitler and others, but more critical readings of them generally don\u2019t take his word at face value, so while some works still try to push such stories, I feel that Kenneth Lewes\u2019 review of \u201cThe Hidden Hitler\u201d, one of the more recent works that does so, is on the money in pointing out how he: > find[s] unjustified journalistic attempts to sniff out homosexual activity among the infamous and powerful offensive. But their real danger is the way they reenforce convenient stereotypes and thereby protect unconscious fears and hatreds from being brought out into the light and understood for what they are.Shirer used claims of homosexuality to paint the Nazis as moral degenerates, and while they certainly may have been the latter, using their (possible) attraction to other men as evidence ought to be outright rejected, and at the very least not called an \u2018abnormal sexuality\u2019.This gets to the last piece that I mentioned, namely other possible \u201cunusual\u201d sexual practices. And of course, I don\u2019t want to kink-shame and call BDSM-style practices abnormal either, but do need to nevertheless acknowledge that past writers have used claims of those practices as support, and as with homosexuality, in the 1930s and 1940s of course, much of society would have agreed, unfortunately.The final figure I\u2019d note here is Otto Strasser. One of the earliest party big-wigs, he had broken with Hitler and fled Germany in 1930, and like Putzi, made a business of smearing his former compatriots. He too peddled tales of homosexual debauchery running rampant within the party, and added on additional perversions too, being the source of what a 1943 psychoanalysis by the American Walter Langer noted as attraction to \u201can extreme form of masochism in which the individual derives sexual gratification from the act of having a woman urinate or defecate on him,\u2019\u201d Otto in turn having claimed that Geli Raubal told him, presumably from first hand knowledge. Langer was slightly mistaken, but only in degrees, as Strasser\u2019s original words only made reference to watersports rather than coprophilia. Small difference perhaps though, as the more important factor is the broad picture he was painting. Langer has other accounts, second hand, which he claimed also supported the allegations of masochism, but this too was unreliable, and Longer at least admits that he can\u2019t take this as fact, only suspicion.", "label": 0}, {"content": "Goran Haag writes \"Unlike Hitler and Churchill, Mussolini had a normal sexual appetite\".

Further north into Canada the Wendat/Huron were strongly allied with the French, and during the diaspora caused by the Beaver Wars (to be explained shortly) fled west to the Great Lakes.Looking west, [here is a generalized map](_URL_2_) so we can keep our bearings. The Mahican and the Delaware definitely encountered Europeans in the period of interest. First contact along the Mohawk River occurred in 1609 and these groups were intimately involved in the game of colonial expansion with New York/New England/New France. 1657-1717 is a very interesting time for the Haudenosaunee/Iroquois. Hostilities related to the fur trade and disease mortality brought about a series of mourning wars that increased the Haudenosaunee territory, and [wrought destruction over a huge swath of the U.S. Midwest](_URL_5_#mediaviewer/File:5NationsExpansion.jpg). The [Beaver Wars](_URL_5_) turned the Great Lakes into a war zone. Iroquois raids depopulated much of the U.S. Midwest and sent refugees fleeing to the lands bordering the Great Plains. French missionaries fled west with their Huron flock, establishing missions on Lake Michigan by 1652 and the western tip of Lake Superior by 1661. As they moved west, the Huron diaspora opened up the fur trade to nations previously beyond the frontier outposts. Heading directly west of Boston we are basically on the Great Plains before we consider a nation without European contact.Next, lets dive south. English colonial enterprises in Pennsylvania contacted the Erie, Shawnee and previously mentioned Iroquois. Jamestown was established in 1607, and English influence continued to grow among the Algonquian nations living in the tidewater. To the west of the tidewater we start to run into the area of Iroquois expansion during the Beaver Wars so I will dive further south.Between 1657 and 1717,  traders operating out of Virginia and Carolina colonies united the greater U.S. Southeast based on the trade of Indian slaves and deerskins. Though actual \"white guy presence\" was limited, the repercussions of the Indian slave trade destabilized the south. Pressure from the French and English spurred the rise of confederacies like the Creek, Cherokee, Chickasaw and Choctaw to deal with the encroachment of the French to the west (operating from Louisiana and the Mississippi River) and the English (with their native, slave-raiding allies) to the east. As an aside, from 1696-1700 a devastating smallpox epidemic spread through the southeast causing tremendous mortality in the region. Epidemics, combined with refugees fleeing the [Yamasee War](_URL_1_) from 1715-1717, shattered the existing lifeways in the south. The interior southeastern nations, as well as the petite nations along the Gulf Coast, all felt the repercussions of contact with Europeans between 1657 and 1717.So, we are at the Mississippi and we have yet to encounter a Native American nation without contact with/significant influence from Europeans between 1657 and 1717. Obviously, the nations of New Mexico and Texas near Spanish missions are out of consideration. In New Mexico the Spanish presence along the Rio Grande ensures the Pueblos, Apaches, Utes, Dine, Comanche and many smaller Southwestern nations could contact a white guy. The first mission in Spanish Texas, San Francisco de los Tejas, was established in 1690. The [Spanish presence in Texas](_URL_0_) was not influential, long-lived, or particularly productive during our time period, but it does mean we need to look north of the Red River for a nation that fits our criteria (Edit: The first mission founded in the geographic region that we know as Texas was [San Angelo](_URL_3_), founded in 1632. Thanks to /u/_choupette for clarifying.)Where does this leave us? In 1717 you would need to be on the Great Plains, likely north of the Red River, and west of French influence along the Mississippi River/Great Lakes to encounter a Native American nation that had yet to contact a white person. Even then, contact was imminent. For example, the first European encounter with the Mandan occurred with the arrival of a French Canadian trader, Sieur de la Verendrye, in 1738.**Sources**Calloway *Once Vast Winter Count: The Native American West Before Lewis and Clark*Kelton *Epidemics and Enslavement: Biological Catastrophe in the Native Southeast 1492-1715*Gallay *The Indian Slave Trade: The Rise of the English Empire in the American South, 1670-1717*Bragdon *Native Peoples of Southern New England, 1650-1775*Trigger *The Children of Aataentsic: A History of the Huron People to 1660*Weber *The Spanish Frontier in North America*", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Iroquois Confederacy was a Native American tribe that lived in the Northeastern United States.

It viewed it as its occidental analogy (hence naming it after its own great dynasty of the time).  And that whole long, strange trip of discovery would open up an incredible new world of trade to both empires.The Han Empire\u2019s relationship with Rome must first begin with its tense, violent relationship to a far closer empire: the Xiongnu Confederacy of the Central Asian Steppes (think the Mongolians about 1400 years before they were Mongolians).  The early reign of Emperor Wu of Han (one of its greats) had increased the heat and pressure along the two powers\u2019 extensive borders to the boiling point.  In the third year of his reign, 139 BCE, Wu had dispatched his envoy Zhang Qian to explore the unknown vastness of central Asia beyond the Han\u2019s western border at the Jade Gate Pass, and establish relations with any peoples he might come across.  This had long been a goal of the Chinese imperial court, but the Xiongnu Empire militarily controlling the only real passage westward had prevented it: then called Xiyu (literally, \u201cWestern Regions\u201d), and today Xinjiang Autonomous Region that makes up China\u2019s arid northwestern border.  As China\u2019s only reasonable land route westward, the Han already knew it would be an immensely valuable area to hold, and indeed it would eventually become a key portion of the Silk Road trade route\u2026 but first it would have to be taken.Emperor Wu had chosen Zhang Qian because of his firsthand knowledge of the Xiongnu and their customs.  He, along with a captured Xiongnu guide named Ganfu, and ninety-eight others, had been sent to both scout out the territory, as well as find a way through the Xiongnu-controlled Xiyu.  On the far side, it was believed that a people called the Yuezhi (also, the Rouzhi and identified by the Greeks as T\u00f3kharoi), who had been expelled from their ancestral lands during the Xiongnu occupation existed.  Emperor Wu wished to find and treat with the Yuezhi king, and convince his to aid the Han Empire in retaking Xiyu and opening up the western road to travel and trade.Things didn\u2019t start out so well for Zhang Qian, though.  Virtually right out of the starting gate, he and his party were captured by Xiongnu patrols as they attempted to cross the world\u2019s second largest shifting sand desert in the Tarim Basin \u2013 the Taklamakan, whose name either comes from Arabic, meaning \u201cthe abandoned place,\u201d or Turki, meaning \u201cthe place of ruin.\u201d  Zhang Qian\u2019s entire party was taken captive and enslaved by the Xiongnu (including the Xiongnu guide himself, Ganfu\u2026 welcome home).  For a period of ten years, Zhang would work under the lash of his captors, but was able to build a rapport with the local tribal leader, and eventually married a Xiongnu woman who bore him a son.Finally in 129 BCE, Zhang Qian was able to escape his captors, along with his wife, young son, and the guide Ganfu.  Though the rest of his party had been lost, the four continued westward, around the northern edge of the Tarim Basin and the now dried-up salt lake Lop Nor, through the Dayuan Kingdom (whose markedly Caucasian-looking citizens were noted by Zhang, and were likely remnants of Alexander the Great of Greece\u2019s conquest and colonization pf the area two centuries prior).  It wasn\u2019t until 126 BCE that Zhang Qian finally found the long-lost Yuezhi Kingdom, which by this time had settled in Bactria, centered around Samarkand (modern Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and northern Afghanistan).  Zhang Qian was permitted an audience with the Yuezhi king, but was unable to convince him to return to the east to retake their lost homelands from the Xiongnu.  The rather liked it where they were, thank you very much\u2026 plus, those horse-people were really scary.  Regardless, Zhang Qian was welcomed within the Yuezhi Kingdom, and he stayed for a year, documenting their culture, lifestyle, and economy, as well as the myriad cultures surrounding the country that were wholly alien to the Chinese up until this point.  In late 126, Zhang, his family, and he guide Ganfu departed the Yuezhi Kingdom and began their return trip to Han China.  This time they skirted the Tarim Basin to the south (both his north and south routes would ultimately make up the Silk Road\u2019s path around the harsh desert basin), and were once again captured by the Xiongnu, but they released him \u2013 in spite of the hostilities which had been ongoing with the Han Empire for almost a decade at this point \u2013 because they respected his sense of duty and composure in the face of death.  He was held for two years, before once again escaping when infighting broke out following the death of the tribal leader, and finally returned to Chang\u2019an and the waiting Emperor Wu with his report.Zhang Qian\u2019s report described in great detail the kingdoms he had personally visited or traversed.  I\u2019ll relate some excerpts of Zhang\u2019s report, as relayed through Sima Qian\u2019s Shiji, itself translated by the esteemed Dr. Burton Watson: \u2022\tthe Dayuan/Ionian Kingdom, whom Zhang described as \u201csouthwest of the territory of the Xiongnu, some 10,000 li (5,000 kilometers) directly west of China. The people are settled on the land, plowing the fields and growing rice and wheat. They also make wine out of grapes. The people live in houses in fortified cities, there being some seventy or more cities of various sizes in the region. The population numbers several hundred thousand\"\u2022\tthe Yuezhi, described as \u201cThe Great Yuezhi live some 2,000 or 3,000 li (1,000 or 1,500 kilometers) west of Dayuan, north of the Gui (Oxus) river. They are bordered to the south by Daxia (Bactria), on the west by Anxi, and on the north by Kangju. They are a nation of nomads, moving place to place with their herds and their customs are like those of the Xiongnu. They have some 100,000 or 200,000 archer warriors.\"\u2022\tDaxia/Bactria, described as \u201csituated over 2,000 li (1,000 kilometers) southwest of Dayuan, south of the Gui (Oxus) river. Its people cultivate the land, and have cities and houses. Their customs are like those of Dayuan. It has no great ruler but only a number of petty chiefs ruling the various cities. The people are poor in the use of arms and afraid of battle, but they are clever at commerce. After the Great Yuezhi moved west and attacked and conquered Daxia, the entire country came under their sway. The population of the country is large, numbering some 1,000,000 or more persons. The capital is Lanshi (Bactra) where all sorts of goods are bought and sold.\"\u2022\tthe northern kingdom Zhang called the Kangju, which may have been of either Turkic, Iranian, or Tocharian origin, described as \u201csituated some 2,000 li (1,000 kilometers) northwest of Dayuan. Its people are nomads and resemble the Yuezhi in their customs. They have 80,000 or 90,000 skilled archer fighters. The country is small, and borders Dayuan. It acknowledges sovereignty to the Yuezhi people in the South and the Xiongnu in the East.\"He also made mention of many other peoples and kingdoms he had heard of or discussed while abroad, including \u2022\tAnxi (the Parthian Empire which was a kind of successor state to the ancient Persian Empire), \"Anxi is situated several thousand li west of the region of the Great Yuezhi. The people are settled on the land, cultivating the fields and growing rice and wheat. They also make wine out of grapes. They have walled cities like the people of Dayuan, the region contains several hundred cities of various sizes. The coins of the country are made of silver and bear the face of the king. When the king dies, the currency is immediately changed and new coins issued with the face of his successor. The people keep records by writing on horizontal strips of leather. To the west lies Tiaozhi.\" \u2022\tTiaozhi (which remains ill-defined, but might have been Mesopotamia), described as, \u201csituated several thousand li west of Anxi and borders the Western Sea (probably either Persian Gulf or the Mediterranean). It is hot and damp, and the people live by cultivating the fields and planting rice... The people are very numerous and are ruled by many petty chiefs. The ruler of Anxi gives orders to these chiefs and regards them as vassals.\u2022\tShendu (Northern India/Pakistan), saying, \"Shendu, they told me, lies several thousand li southeast of Daxia (Bactria). The people cultivate the land and live much like the people of Daxia. The region is said to be hot and damp. The inhabitants ride elephants when they go in battle. The kingdom is situated on a great river (Indus).\"Zhang Qian was rewarded lavishly by Emperor Wu, and honored with a position as palace counselor.  He would conduct a second and final journey to the west in his lifetime from 119-115 BCE as part of a trade mission to the Wusun people, which would result in a long-term link between Han China and the Parthinian/Persian Empire.  Upon his triumphant return, Zhang was appointed the Imperial Grand Messenger, making him one of the nine most powerful ministers in government.  He would die little more than a year later in the year 113, but had laid virtually all of the groundwork for the higly lucrative Silk Road trade network, both in terms of finding the literal western road out of China, and establishing connections with its distant neighbors.Sima Qian.  *The Records of the Grand Historian* (\u53f2\u8a18).  _URL_0_ (Mandarin).Watson (1993): Records of the Grand Historian' by Sima Qian, Han Dynasty II, (Revised Edition).

Yes! From my own study of America during that time period, I recalled seeing Wilson addressed as Mr. President in print, but I wanted to confirm that by finding a verifiable example with a source.

Edit, spelling mistakes.Seems like no one has answered your question. I studied Roman animal games in college. I was more interested in how the animals were procured and transported instead of what animal would win. The question is who would win between a tiger and lion in an ancient Roman animal game. Circumstantial evidence suggests that tigers are the favored animal, but direct evidence seems scarce. Romans loved animal games, called *venatios*. Large cat games were probably high quality games that attracted many spectators since tigers were harder to source than lions. Lions predominantly came from North Africa. Lions became common combatants in Roman games after they first appeared in Rome in 186 BCE. (Livy, 39.22.1-2). According to Livy, lions and leopards were first debuted in Rome in the same year. There are numerous Roman mosaics depicting lions in great and accurate detail suggesting they were familiar with the animal. Many attribute the disappearance of the North African lion to *venatios*. Tigers seem to be the favored animal because they are slightly more aggressive. The reasons are two fold: 1) tigers are mostly solitary animals while lions live and fight in packs/prides; 2) tigers are more aggressive, going straight for the kill, where as lions tend to pounce and exhaust their prey. In 1899, the Gaekwar of Baroda in Hindostan, hosted a battle between a lion and a tiger. He had a specially prepared amphitheatre and hosted the games for local and European guests. Apparently, he set the odds at 1 to 37,000 rupees, against the tiger. The tiger won; the Gaekwar of Baroda lost 37,000 rupees. (*Lion Against Tiger*, Baltimore Sun, Jan. 26, 1899). In 2011, a Bengal tiger killed a lion in a Turkish zoo in Ankara. The tiger broke into the lion's cage through a gap in the fence. Allegedly, \"the tiger severed the lion's jugular vein in a single stroke with its paw, leaving the animal dying in a pool of blood.\" (*Tiger kills lion in Turkish zoo*, BBC, Mar. 7, 2011). Furthermore, Smithsonian Zoo biologist Craig Saffoe also favors the tiger. In an interview with Live Science, Saffoe suggested a tiger would win because \"[w]hat I've seen from tigers, they seem to be more aggressive; they go for the throat, go for the kill ... [w]hereas lions are more 'I'll will just pound on you and play with you.\" (*What Would Happen If a Lion Fought a Tiger?* , LiveScience, Jul. 16, 2012). There are, however, mitigating circumstances. If a lion is older, he is more likely experienced in combat. But, if he is older, he is probably more used to going along unchallenged in a pride. Younger lions, especially lions without prides, are less experienced fighters (ergo, no pride). From what I studied in college, I will add that a tiger raised in captivity would probably be more aggressive than a lion in captivity. One of the ways big cats were captured and sold was by a process called *cubbing*. Cubs were abducted because they were easier to capture, easier to transport, and less dangerous to handle. Tigers are generally solitary animals and have little inclination to work in a group. On the other hand, lions are \"pack animals.\" Lions can coexist in a social unit. If a lion was raised in captivity, it is less likely to be a dominant animal because a human would attempt to curb any dominant behaviors. A tiger, however, would be less indomitable. (This is my speculation). However, a lion may have been favored against a leopard. Some direct Roman evidence of big cat fights is found in the House of the Doves in Pompeii. Mosaic VIII.2.34 shows a snarling lion pinning a wounded leopard to the floor. The leopard's blood gushes unto the floor from its neck and from a wound on it's flank. _URL_5__URL_0__URL_4__URL_3__URL_1__URL_2_", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Romans had a record of a lion vs a tiger fight in which the tiger won.

In fact, I was surprised to read all about it a few years ago when I went from the German-language historical sphere to also discussing history on an international scale in the English language - because we Germans have no record of this quote, and one of us is supposed to have said it. Seeing as how English was not the international language of choice back then, it would stand to be argued that there should be more German sources about this quote than English ones - but in fact, there is not a single one that I know of. If anyone knows the German original, I'd be glad.But as they say, absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, and there certainly was a whole bunch of conflict in the Balkans and concern about said conflict in the rest of Europe. So this is the supposed quote, in English, as according to Wikiquote's \"Disputed\" section on Bismarck.*Europe today is a powder keg and the leaders are like men smoking in an arsenal \u2026 A single spark will set off an explosion that will consume us all \u2026 I cannot tell you when that explosion will occur, but I can tell you where \u2026 Some damned foolish thing in the Balkans will set it off.*Wikiquote takes this quote from Andrei Navrozov's *Chronicles* (Volume 32, 2008), with Navrozov also already putting its legitimacy in doubt. The earliest apparance of something akin to this Bismarck quote in English language literature seems to be Winston Churchill's 1923 account of the Great War, *World Crisis*, more specifically Volume 1, concerned with the years 1911 to 1914. Churchill attributes the quotes as having come to his attention from Albert Ballin, a German diplomat, who in turn according to Churchill told Churchill that he heard it from Bismarck. Dubious, to say the least.So the first time someone mentions the quote is 1923, a quarter of a century after Bismarck's death - and that someone is Winston Churchill, a man who always was more concerned with writing history with his books than writing books about history.Anyway, with the question about the accuracy of the quote out of the way, we can nevertheless look at the history of the Balkan Conflict up until the 1890s and then until 1914 and beyond.First, a lesson in historical geography. [This](_URL_0_) map comes courtesy of the great cartography index of the University of Texas at Austin. Seriously, UT has amazing maps from various historical eras freely available to browse. Bless them.Anyway. The map is from 1899, so shortly after Bismarck's death and the last possible nsituation he could have looked at. As the quote is IMO bogus, we might as well go to the 1890s rather to the 1870s.The Balkans are surrounded by four great powers:The Ottoman Empire, to the southeast and in the center. The Ottomans for a long time were the principal power in the Balkans and defined most of its conflicts. It was the Ottomans who brought Islam to the region, which is the reasion Bosnia and Herzegovina and Albania are majority- or plurality-Muslim countries to this day. This religious zeal on the part of the Turks made them easy to hate for the local Christians, be they catholic, orthodox or protestant. However, the Ottomans were for a long time the absolutely dominant power of the region, easily suppressing any and all resistance. After taking Constantinople in 1453, they swept across the disunited and squabbling Christian warlords straight into Hungary, seizing parts of it for themselves and only being stopped when their first siege of Vienna was repelled in 1529, the first of several painful defeats for Ottoman expansionism, next to the loss at Lepanto in 1571, the failed attack on Malta in 1565 and eventually their second failed attempt to take Vienna in 1683 [insert Sabaton meme here]. But although their *expansion* was stopped, the Christian reconquest of these territories was slow and riddled with losses at Turkish hands. The primary antagonist to the Ottomans were the Habsburg Austrians, to whom we will get shortly. Through the 1600s and 1700s, the Ottomans remained a force to be reckoned with, but through various, primarily internal, factors, they began to decline in the late 1700s. After initial Ottoman victories against Serbian insurgents, the country successfully broke from the Ottoman yoke in 1817. In 1821, the Ottomans failed to prevent Greek independence. The 1850s saw Montenegro break free and when Russia and the Ottomans found themselves at war in the late 1870s, that also provided the chance for Romanian freedom. The Ottomans by 1899 were on their way out - but they still held the heartland of the Balkans, including various peoples that still desired freedom or that were appealing to control for the other great powers.These other great powers being the Austrians to the northwest and the Russians to the northeast and to a lesser extent Italy across the sea in the west. Italian ambition primarily aimed at North Africa for now, going to war against the Ottomans in 1911 and critically seizing not only Libya but also several islands in the Aegean Sea, but Italy would by World War 2 also get involved in the Balkan game. That's a story for another time.So, what did these powers have in terms of interests and conflicts at the time of Bismarck's death?The Ottomans wanted to **survive**. Cutting their losses and preserving what they at that point still had was their main objective, with a counterattack not really possible. The Balkan Wars of 1912 and 1913 would of course prove them right, being pushed off the Balkan peninsula entirely until Bulgarian arrogance provided them a chance to at least restore control over the area of East Thrace - a territory that to us is better known as \"that weird part of Turkey in Europe even though most of the country is in Asia\".The Austro-Hungarians wanted to **expand**. Not only did this rampant Austro-Hungarian anti-nationalistic imperalism eventually cause the first declaration of war of World War 1, Austria-Hungary saw itself threatened by its various ethnicities (and rightfully so) as well as by the surrounding great powers. Both Italy and Russia were perceived as threats (and rightfully so). It was opportunism after losing the struggle regarding German dominance to Prussia in the 1860s that primarily drove Austria-Hungary to look southeast. The Seven Weeks War had established the North German Confederation, which would eventually become the German Empire, and had also seen a significant Italian advance into Veneto - an advance that did not go far enough in the eyes of Italian nationalists, who know looked longlingly at South Tyrol, Istria and Dalmatia, all still in Habsburg hands. In hindsight, it likely would have been better for Austria-Hungary to hunker down rather thank taking the offensive in Bosnia 1908 and then Serbia 1914, but that was simply not the diplomatic way of thinking back then.The Balkan peoples wanted to **push out the Great Powers, but different GPs depending on which country you're talking about**. It is no isolated incident that a pan-nationalistic Serb killed the prince of a great power to cause World War One. The Serbians really didn't want the Austrians in Bosnia, where many Serbians lived - and definitely not on their doorstep at all. Serbia had witnessed Austria's reach for Bosnia in 1908 and was concerned about its own position - and rightly so, as proven by the fact that Austria's attack on Serbia was what kicked off the Great War on 28 July 1914. The Romanians wanted to liberate fellow ethnic Romanians living under the Hungarian and thus Habsburg yoke. Montenegro didn't have great plans of expansion, but they also didn't like the idea of the Habsburg kicking in their front door. Greece was still too small for its own liking and tried to take a bite from the Ottomans - which it eventually did in the 1912 Balkan War and then, as dessert, they even got some of the Bulgarian spoils in 1913 in round two.The Russians wanted **allies and economic influence**. Russia was kind of the wildcard in the Balkans, as they didn't want to directly control the territory. That and their ethnic Slavicness made them appear as natural allies to several countries in the Balkans, but they eventually only ended up allying Serbia. Romania had preferred to enter into an assocation with the Central Powers to bide its time and see the diplomatic situation develop, Bulgaria viewed Russia as a possible friend but they absolutely hated the Serbians post 1913 and so eventually chose to cut their losses and end the rivalry with the Turks to over the Turks get on the good side of the Germans and eventually the Austrians to then in turn get a second shot at reclaiming the Balkan empire they had failed to conquer in the 1913 Second Balkan War. The Russians also were the country perhaps even more than the others concerned with its own prestige after losing a war to Japan of all countries in 1904.

It is one of those things that superficially might make sense to someone. Sparrows, like rats, eat grain. So every grain that is eaten by a sparrow is grain that cannot be eaten by a person. So kill all the sparrows, you get more grain, right? (And hey, who wouldn't like to get rid of mosquitos? I mean, other than spiders and malaria protozoans.)The problem is, of course, that ecologically this sort of thing has all sorts of unintended side-effects. Sparrows eat more than grain \u2014 they also eat lots of insects, insects that themselves eat crops. So instead of decreasing crop pests, they unintentionally increased them. (This is Ecology 101, and was not a new idea at the time of the Four Pests Campaign. Studies of the mutual interdependence of animal populations were already quite common by the 1930s.)This is the sort of \"big idea by fiat\" that Mao became famous for.

The Pacific salmon and Pacific trout is Oncorhynchus (hooknosed), whereas the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is what you find in the waters around Norway.Pacific salmon and atlantic salmon have different parasites. Pacific salmon may have a paracite in it that creates a buildup of white liquid in the flesh of the fish. For this reason, the Japanese, who traditionally were almost entirely self-reliant on fish and barely imported any, saw salmon as a cheap low-quality fish that primarily was used in curries, fried or dried. While Norwegian cuisine doesn't deal with a lot of raw fish, salmon is often cold-smoked or cured, which requires a higher quality product than if it was dried or cooked. The Atlantic salmon does not have the same diseases as Pacific salmon. One of the primary parasites that the Norwegian salmon farming industry are Salmon louse, and they are on the outside of the fish, so the contaminated fish can be visually selected so as to not send bad fish to a customer who wants a pristine product.Fish is Norway's second largest export, and Norwegian delegations visiting foreign countries very often have representatives who are there to market Norwegian Salmon. Norway holds the record for the world's largest sushi mosaic, and enjoy their salmon-centric publicity.In 1974, Norway sent a trade delegation to Japan, and Thor Listau saw that the Japanese saw salmon as a cheap low-quality fish. He decided that high quality Norwegian salmon could be sold there. By 1980 Norway had started exporting a tiny bit of salmon to Japan, but it was primarily used for grilling. At least it didn't have to be hidden away in a curry sauce of covered in batter. Norway sent another trade delegation to Japan in 1985, and served raw Norwegian salmon as sushi at their embassy. The Japanese thought the salmon was fine, the Norwegians didn't particularly enjoy raw fish. The Norwegians launched \"Project Japan\". It was difficult to get a foothold in the market, because Japanese fish importers were at this time not used to dealing with salmon, and thought it was the wrong colour and smell, amongst other things. Norway did in-depth market analysis and went straight to chefs (like Yutaka Ishinabe from The Iron Chef) to get celebrity endorsements. It took a decade for (Norwegian) salmon to get any sort of main-steam acceptance as sushi from there. The change was helped along by declining fishing production in Japan, and a change in their eating habits - the economic uptick meant that more salarymen would eat out for lunch instead of bringing their own, and sushi is a popular lunch food. Salmon was relegated to conveyorbelt sushi for a while due to being considerably cheaper than prized fish like Tuna.The Norwegians also set out to differentiate their salmon from the Pacific salmon in other ways. Salmon in Japanese is \"sake\", and the Norwegians would use english for their product, which in katakana was s\u0101mon. They also tried emphasising their slower growing and fattier breeds to appeal to the Japanese pallet. Aside from parasites, the Japanese always considered salmon to be a bit too lean for proper sushi. In recent years, salmon has even risen drastically in popularity, to the point where it often scores in the top 3 favourite fish for sushi, especially for young people who might have grown up with it.", "label": 0}, {"content": "Sushi has changed over the years, with the introduction of rice, rice vinegar, and rice wine.

[Whores in History: Prostitution in Western Society](_URL_1_)You might also look at [The upstairs girls, prostitution in the American West](_URL_0_)Any discussion of prostitution in the historical context is invariably influenced by modern politics.  Until the 20th century, the idea of \"social history\" was fairly radical, and more traditional views of history prevailed. (i.e. kings and generals, wars, nations, political movements etc.).  When you combine this with the idea that traditional morality often looks down on the business of selling sex for money, most histories of prostitution are relatively recent, written since 80's and 90's.  Even then, you have a rather sharp discord between more traditionalist historians, and various stripes of feminist and marxist historians each of whom would put their own particular spin on the nature of prostitution.  Moving on to what I can say more specifically.  There's a popular conception that may not be entirely accurate.  There were certainly prostitutes in the old west, but they were not perhaps as common as might be thought, and perhaps more accurately, there were different levels of the trade. In the \"old west\" - California in the 1850's and territories west of the Missouri River, Kansas City, etc/. The Dakotas into the 1870's., the population was 90% men.   The areas were mostly under federal jurisdiction.  It was far from the moral judgment of eastern victorian era society, but the moral judgment was not entirely absent. Women who were seen to be open prostitutes were harshly judged, even in western society. Common names were \"soiled doves\" and \"Daughters of sin.\"   Prostitution was illegal almost everywhere in the west, but the Federal government had bigger things to worry about, and local law enforcement was often in its infancy.  Direct acts of prostitution were often banished outskirts of the community (or driven underground) and were one of the first things displaced when \"civilization\" moved in. That said, when you had a population that was disproportionately young, disproportionately male, and with money to spare, there was undeniably a demand for female companionship. Enter the \"saloon girl.\"  Under the Victorian standards of the time, these girls would still have been engaged in a dishonorable profession, but in a looser society, these girls could maintain a distance from the seedier aspects of the profession, and if some engaged in direct prostitution, it was far more discreet (and many may not have done so at all). A saloon girl was a woman employed by a bar.  This is roughly analogous to a Japanese Hostess, although the cultural context is different. Many were refugees of a sort, having left farm life or life in an an eastern mill by the same promise that drove men out west in droves. The promise of high wages.  Flyers promised Saloon girls $10 a day, which was 3x the wage a laborer could make.The Saloon Girls were paid by the bar owner to sit in the bar and interact with the male patrons.  They were paid a commission on each drink they sold, and often male patrons of the bar would have the opportunity to buy the girls overpriced drinks.  They would also dance with the men, for a fee, split between the girl and the house. Although these girls often dressed provocatively, these Saloon girls were considered \"good girls\" by their customers, and indeed that was part of their allure.  The bar owners correctly judged that many men would rather interact with \"good\" women, on the possible hope of something to follow, than with a woman who was simply exchanging cash for an act.   That said, the saloon girls may or may not have been willing to bestow extra favors upon particualrly good customers, although the entire relationship maintained an air of plausible deniability, both from the sales side (we're selling overpriced drinks, not women) and the buyers side (buying a drink for a girl isn't the same as paying her right?). And indeed, the nature of a Saloon Girls' employment made it possible to transition into a more respectable life when the area became more civilized. Being a Saloon girl also did not necessarily preclude other, more conventional employment. And if a Saloon girl managed to settle down later, again, there was less to gloss over than if she had been a much lower class prostitute. Below the saloon girls would have been girls who were more obviously prostitutes, but were high class prostitutes operated out of brothels or \"parlor houses.\" In these type of establishments gentlemen would be able to call and engage in social activity with the women. Again drinks were available and there was more involved than simply picking a girl out of a lineup like is often depicted in film.  The social interaction however, would culminate in the pair going upstairs to a room to negotiate further.    Many such parlor houses were run by a female madam, and maintained bouncers to protect the girls.  Again, there was somewhat of an air of plausible deniability.  In more modern terminology, the girls might be considered \"independent contractors\" and what they purported to do in those upper rooms was between them and their clients, and something the madam could theoretically still deny, even if it was an open secret. Even these parlor houses were often discouraged and pushed into areas of town. The practice of identifying the houses by hanging red lights gave rise to the term \"red light district.\" As local governments gained strength and brought \"civilization\" and morality with them, these entities were pushed out. At the lowest level would have been women who operated out of their own businesses or streetwalkers. In some areas, laundrywomen developed a reputation as brothel owners, which in some cases was tied to the prostitution (and sex slavery in reality) of Asian women. As a laundry run by Asians might double as a brothel.  These truly did operate at the lowest level, being often in the underground economy.   Prices varied widely, with the cheapest prostitutes being a few dollars, (about a day's wage for a moderately skilled or hard working laborer), to high class prostitutes costing $50 or more.  As for whether they shaved their legs, I personally have no idea, however, there are photo plates and paintings around if you care to look for them, that gives some evidence that grooming standards weren't all that different from today.", "label": 0}, {"content": "In the \" Wild West \", prostitution was a common practice.

Some zoos even included permanent exhibits to display these \"human animals\" for the enjoyment of \"cultured\" European and American audiences. Although to be sure, at least some of the participants were there after their nominal acquiescence (although how *enthusiastic* that might be is another matter) - especially the case with those put on in France, it would seem - it was not always the case - some were little more than slaves/property of the exhibition company, bought in Africa and brought over to a country that while perhaps they were nominally now free, they had no ability to exploit that in. Either way of course, few could very well conceptualize what it was that they had agreed to partake in, and many were not only presented in setting which were at best without context, if not entirely contrived, but some physically mutilated to better fit the image that was supposed to be conveyed, as we'll see with perhaps the most famous example from the turn of the century period.Ota Benga, a Congo Pygmy, was exhibited at the St. Louis World Fair in 1904 alongside several other Congolese. In order to play up his billing as a cannibal from savage wilds of Africa, his teeth were filed into points - quite possibly by his \"handlers\" - which certainly was a draw, as can be seen from this description given of him:    Have you seen Otabenga\u2019s [sic] teeth!    They\u2019re worth the 5 cents he charges for showing them to visitors on anthropology hill out at the World\u2019s Fair.    Otabenga is a cannibal, the only genuine African cannibal in America today. He\u2019s    also the only human chattel. He belongs to the Exposition company. Step right up.    There\u2019s no charge except to see his teeth. He has the reputation of being a man eater    and has [on] exhibition the identical molars and incisors with which it was done.    His teeth are as sharp as those of any wild animal. They are pointed like the    teeth of a saw. They have been filed that way.    Otabenga himself looks playful and harmless enough. He is gentle and graceful,    and the first impulse of the visitor is to pet him and exclaim: \u201cPoor little fellow; he    looks so sad and lonely.\u201d    But look at his teeth!    Perhaps he\u2019s lonesome because he is deprived of his native food. Otabenga is pitiable,    though he is to be feared and shuddered at.He had been \"discovered\" by Samuel P. Verner, who had been sent to the Congo - then one of the worst hell-holes on earth under the ownership of the Belgian King - with $8,500 to find \"one pygmy patriarch or chief. One adult woman, preferably his wife. One adult man, preferably his son. One adult woman, the wife of the last or daughter of the first. One female youth unmarried. Two infants of women in the expedition [...] All of the above to be pygmies,\" and bought Benga for an uncertain sum (generally given as a point of salt). Benga was likely the sole surviving member of his family, which had been slaughtered by the Belgian Force Publique, and himself captured and enslaved by a rival group, the Baschileles, from whom Verner bought him. This little group assembled by Verner would join hundreds more from other \"primitive area\" of the world, as well as several groups of Native Americans put on display as well at the Fair - a particularly popular attraction for American expositions.Poor Ota briefly returned to Congo for a time, but came back to the US in 1906 at the behest of Verner (who claimed that it was Ota's choice in order to 'an effort to salvage or create a new sense of himself and a semblance of happiness'), where he was put on display in a locked, bare cage at the Bronx Zoo's Monkey House where he was a popular exhibit, but also drew protests which eventually resulted in his release, after which his care was taken up by Rev. James H. Gordon who took him in and looked after him for a time. He would eventually commit suicide a decade later, despondent about being unable to return to Africa, in part due to the on-going World War. While his ultimate fate is not necessarily the norm for all those who participated, it is a particularly tragic coda to one such victim of these sorts of displays, and death was not an *uncommon* outcome for these people, thrust into strange new environments often with little preparation. For others with less tragic ends, some, such as the other members of his \"display\" in St. Louis, returned to their homes not to come back to the US as Ota had done. Others would put on their displays again in other locales. Some groups would essentially be traveling ethnographic displays, making a tour of various cities and setting up their faux-village in new places for new (paying) crowds.Lacking the literacy skills, few of them left a particularly expressive written record of their thoughts on the whole experience, but records do show that many were less than happy with their treatment. And more than a few had no opportunity to express their distaste, being ill-suited to their new environment's climate, food, diseases, and dying. One traveling troupe of Aboriginal Australians arrived in Germany in 1883 with 8 members, and would number only 5 two years later. They remained in Germany over a decade, to be whittled down to 3 in 1896. Two families of Inuit came to Germany in 1880 for a tour, and all were dead within a year. For those who didn't succumb fatally, general unhappiness nevertheless led to many running away, or refusing to partake in the contrived activities put towards them by organizers. A few were able to bring court cases for abuse, but being strangers in a strange land, not many would have been able to do so easily. While at least some of those who participated in these displays were treated well, and paid handsomely, they seem to be the exception, not the rule.So all in all, while the individual experience of any given participant will vary, and not many left records of their thoughts (I was unsuccessful finding any first person accounts from Chicago participants, although they may exist somewhere) we can look at the phenomenon generally, and make some broad conclusions. Although not the *likely* outcome, the new environment for the participants could be a stressful one, resulting in death. More commonly than that, it could at least result in various forms of resistance, both active and passive, to continued participation, as many of them lacked complete agency and control of their lives while members of these groups, with power ultimately resting in whichever white men were running the show. Depending on how the particular \"troupe\" was organized, completion of an exhibition might mean they were done, and they would return home, or it might mean they simply packed up and went to a new city.

It's also a history in which the facts very often bear little resemblance to the public perception. Let's unpack.Britain's royals were, to begin with, very early adopters of TV; in December 1936 \u2013 only a month after the first regular publicly-available broadcasts began in London, and at a time when there were fewer than 1,000 TV sets in the country \u2013 a report in *Television and Short-Wave World* recorded that  > Striking proof of the progress made in television is the announcement that television receivers are being installed at Buckingham Palace...

I've not been able to establish whether those TVs were purchased by the royal family or were gifts from the manufacturers (who would have had every reason to present sets to such eminent early adopters), but we do know that a significant proportion of early electronic devices - radios and TVs - were not purchased outright, but were sold via hire purchase agreements. Indeed, 75% of all radios sold in the UK in 1938 were purchased on HP, and British adverts for TVs that were available for purchase in this way \"on easy terms\" were certainly appearing by 1938.TV broadcasts were suspended in the UK during the war years, and sales of TVs were slow to pick up even when they recommenced in 1947 - but in popular accounts, at least, it was the coronation Elizabeth II in 1953 that was the critical turning point for adoption of the new medium in Britain. At a time when there was still only a single broadcaster, the BBC, and when British broadcasting was still restricted to a couple of hours in the late afternoon and a few more in the evening (separated by a shutdown intended to allow mothers to get their far-too-easily-distracted children to bed), it was the first time that a single event had filled the schedules for almost an entire day and the first time that a hitherto sacred, semi-private ceremony had been available to mere commoners; *The Times* next day remarked that \"for the first time in perhaps a thousand years, the Sovereign was crowned in the sight of many thousands of the humblest of her subjects.\" The coronation was also reckoned responsible for the spread of TV ownership outside the most affluent classes. In 1947, almost 50% of TVs in Britain were owned by the top 12% of the population. After 1953 the spread was much more even, a phenomenon fuelled by the increasing availability of rental TVs, paid for weekly or monthly. A [2013 BBC account](_URL_2_) of the event recalls a sudden surge in such sales, which reached 2.7 million just ahead of the ceremony, and reports that > In the UK, nearly eight million people tuned in at home, while 10 million crowded into other people's houses to watch. There were a further 1.5 million viewers in cinemas, halls and pubs.It is certainly the case that the ceremony was the first major public occasion in which the UK TV audience outnumbered the radio audience \u2013 by almost 2 to 1, in fact \u2013 but many historians now question whether the coronation was quite the decisive event it appeared to be at the time. According to Joe Moran, > this idea of the coronation as a watershed for TV is unconvincing. By 1953, television in Britain was nearly 30 years old, had accumulated thousands of broadcasting hours and been seen by millions. The number of new licences rose from 400,000 in 1950 to 700,000 in 1951 and 1952 and 1,100,000 in 1953, suggesting that the sales hike for the coronation was part of a steady, inexorable rise, not something sparked by one event. The coronation gave television a helpful nudge, that is all.Whatever the truth, however, there was certainly no turning back after 1953, a truth that probably sat poorly with Elizabeth herself. (Notoriously camera-shy, she had refused to allow TV to broadcast her wedding in 1947 and restricted her annual Christmas message to her subjects to a radio broadcast as late as 1956.) Thus by the early 1960s \u2013 the period currently reached by *The Crown*'s re-imagining of the reign of Elizabeth II \u2013 there were two broadcasters, the advert-free, licence-payment-funded BBC and the commercial Independent Television (ITV), and more than half of British households had television sets.All this preamble brings us to the OP's question. It would certainly have been very easy for the royal family to hire, rather than buy, its televisions by this time. 1960s UK TV rental was dominated by two companies, Radio Rentals \u2013 founded in the early 1930s to hire out, yes, radios \u2013 and Rentaset. These two companies merged in 1964, after which the enlarged Radio Rentals had around 20% of what was a very fragmented market with a large number of purely local players, ahead of Associated Redifusion in third place. Moreover, the decision to rent rather than buy a TV was not entirely an economic one. Contemporary televisions and TV aerials were not fantastically reliable, and one of the most important reasons that customers chose to hire, rather than buy, their sets was that rental agreements normally covered provision of repairs. TV repairmen were extremely commonplace in the UK at the time, and the job was a popular with many technically minded people \u2013 the influential early 1960s record producer Joe Meek, of Telstar fame, was not untypical in having got his start by training to repair TVs.So even the affluent royals might conceivably have had some motive to hire their TVs in the 1960s. But if they did so, how would we know about it? The answer lies in the archaic institution of the Royal Warrant, issued to tradespeople and companies that supply goods and services to royalty. In the UK, warrants are issued to around a thousand different suppliers, carefully administered by the [Royal Warrant Holders Association](_URL_4_), and are highly coveted - not least because the companies that hold them are allowed to announce that they are suppliers of [Good X] \"by royal appointment to\" [member Y of the royal family]. The system allows us to discover that [Domestic Electric Rentals](_URL_1_) (better known as D.E.R. Ltd), which, as its name suggests, was a TV rental company, was indeed awarded a Royal Warrant to supply \"television receivers to Her Majesty the Queen\" at around this time \u2013 but also, crucially that [the warrant was not awarded until March 1968](_URL_6_), several years after the events currently being covered by *The Crown*. Before that, the warrant for the supply of TVs to the Queen had been held by [The Gramophone Company](_URL_0_) of the toney Belgravia district of London, which, as far as I have been able to discover, did not offer hire purchase agreements. I think, then, that any televisions operating in the royal palaces in the early 1960s would have been supplied by The Gramophone Co., and would have been paid for. All this raises the interesting question of why the scriptwriters for *The Crown* might have chosen to depict the Queen Mother as hammering away at a rented TV. I suspect, without being able to prove my case, that this short scene may be a sly tribute to a well-known 1980s British TV trope which saw the \"Queen Mum\" regularly portrayed as a complete vulgarian, with very \"common\" tastes, on the extremely influential satirical puppet show *Spitting Image* - [see, for instance, this clip](_URL_3_) from the show. For this reason, it may be interesting to close this response by noting that, remarkable as it may seem, *Spitting Image*'s depiction has some roots in reality. Here, for instance, are the memories of Colin Burgess, an equerry to the Queen Mother, who is recalling an an incident that took place at Her Majesty's home at Birkhall. After supper one evening, Elizabeth suggested popping on the TV to watch an episode of the popular British TV comedy of class manners, *Keeping Up Appearances*. Unfortunately, the set happened to be tuned to a channel that was showing a boxing match... > Oh, I'm sorry about this, ma'am,' I said, fearing that she would recoil at watching something as violent and bloody as this.  > 'No, no,' she said, 'Leave this on, Colin, you must leave this on.' > And she insisted on watching the whole bout. Everyone was looking at each other with slightly raised eyebrows as this extraordinary scene unfolded. The Queen Mother, as she became more and more engrossed in the fight, slowly edged forwards in her seat and began shouting, 'Go on, hit him, hit him again... Look out, he's going to get up from that... go on, punch him...' > She became totally animated. I don't think I ever saw her come to life as much as in that moment when the boxing came on... It was amazing to see her jabbing the air with her hands clenched into little fists and saying, 'Come on, hit him again, hit him again. Come on, come on.'", "label": 0}, {"content": "In Season 2 of \"The Crown\", Queen Elizabeth II Implores her Mother to Stop Banging on the TV to Make it Work, Saying, \"No Stop it!

The removal, and how painful or hard it might be, depended heavily on how the tar was applied in the first place.The best case scenario for someone submitted to this painful and humiliating chariavari was that they would be subjected to it while still clothed, and with tar straight from the barrel (it ought to be pointed out that this is pine tar, not the kind of tar they use for asphalt. The former doesn't need to be nearly as hot for application as the latter would!). Similar to being clothed, a victim might be wrapped in a sheet, similarly offering protection from the tar, but also making them essentially immobile for the time. If unclothed, the tar of course would be stuck right to the skin. And if heated up, burning and blistering of the skin would only add to the pain as well, although this was reserved for few cases. Many persons might receive something of a mixed treatment, stripped to the waist but tar applied over their pants, at least, although it was surely little comfort in the moment. Another way to add to the pain -both of application and removal - was the beating of mutilation of the victim, such as Thomas Foster, who was tarred by a mob in Natchez, but not before being partially scalped and the tar poured over the wound. To remove the tar was basically a matter of solvents and elbow grease. Turpentine could help to break down the tar - but was itself quite painful once it touched the effected area of skin - but the victims would, in the end, just need a lot of scrubbing with an abrasive from friends or family (removal would need to take place well away from the crowd though. A doctor who came to aid a tarred Tory in 1777 only earned the wrath of the crowd, and was himself then targeted), taking off the tar along with body hair and often layers of skin too. [This photo](_URL_0_) (not for the squeemish) comes from a 20th century tarring, of a German-American seen as unsupportive of WWI, and provides an idea of the after-effects. A condition known as 'tar acne' would often remain afterwards on the skin. To be sure, tarring and feathering itself wasn't fatal. The Mormon leader Joseph Smith, subjected to a tarring, one which he was able to nevertheless walk away from and reach home where he spoke briefly of the removal: > My friends spent the night in scraping and removing the tar, and washing and cleansing my body; so that by morning I was ready to be clothed again. [...] With my flesh all scarified and defaced, I preached to the congregation as usual.Clearly, it had left him a painful reminder of that night, but by his account, not even incapacitated him for a day. A similar result, recounted by Dr. James Carnahan of a 1794 treatment of a Deputy Inspector named John Lyn recounts that: > [Lyn] was left tied to a tree so loosely that he could easily extricate himself. He returned to his house, and after undergoing an ablution with grease and soap and sand and water, he exhibited himself to the boys in the Academy and others, and laughed and made sport of the whole matter.Tar, even when applied hot, would burn the skin but wasn't enough to kill. This isn't to say that it wasn't accompanied by other behavior though, which increased the pain and damage at the very least.Although it seems to have been incredibly rare, a particularly vengeful crowd might \"assist\" in the removal... by lighting the tar aflame, which occurred in Boston to a man named Richard Owen, but again, this wasn't common. Other acts of violence happened too though. The aforementioned surgeon reportedly had his eyes gouged by the crowd too. More commonly, the crowd would parade the victim around though, sometimes for hours, which while not quite as vengeful looking, nevertheless insured that the tar had plenty of time to set (especially in cold weather), which would at the very least add to the pain of removal. One such description of this, from Boston in 1774, recounts: > But the most shocking cruelty was exercised a few Nights ago, upon a poor Old Man a Tidesman one Malcolm he is reckond creasy, a quarrel was pickd wth him, he was afterward taken,  &  Tarrd,  &  featherd. Theres no Law that Knows a punishment for the greatest Crimes beyond what this is, of cruel torture. And this instance exceeds any other before it he was stript Stark naked, one of the severest cold nights this Winter, his body coverd all over with Tar, then with feathers, his arm dislocated in tearing off his cloaths, he was dragd in a Cart with thousands attending, some beating him wth clubs  &  Knocking him out of the Cart, then in again. They gave him several severe whipings, at different parts of the Town. This Spectacle of horror  &  sportive cruelty was exhibited for about five hours.Again, though, it ought to be pointed out tarring wasn't fatal, and Malcom's treatment was some of the worst. The purpose was punishment of transgressions - in the Revolutionary era, often Toryism, and later often used for violations of 'community standards' - and the humiliation was, more than anything, what was aimed for. I bring this up to mention one more \"tarring\" and feathering, one which was probably the least painful of all, which Irvin notes in his essay, where a group of women decided to punish a young man who had interrupted their quilting, not with tar, but with molasses. It still served the same aim, the man's humiliation, but it was decidedly the easiest clean-up of anything else here.So in short, removal depended greatly on how you were tarred. If you were lucky to remain clothed, the biggest pain might very well have been to your pride, while on the other end, someone stripped, given hot tar, and paraded for hours would likely have a very painful night, and a long, painful recovery afterwards.-----------Hersey, Frank W.

War is no longer a series of short and sharp engagements but rather a flowing affair, with larger, strategically oriented battles ('operations') that often encompass several smaller, shorter battles-within-battles (tactical engagements). Deep Battle, or Deep Operations in particular first begins to develop as a theory in the 1920s. Like most developing theories of Mobile Operations at this time, it had one, over-arching goal: Get the battlescape moving, and keep it moving^1. The experiences of the Russian Civil War was the first source of practical experience with which they could create new theory out of - and it fails to reflect the full integration of Mechanization that the wars of the 1930s of and 1940s would have. This is the most immediate difference from Theory, in which the Soviets imagined echelons of Infantry and Cavalry, and Practice, in which tailor-made Corps would be created to form different echelons of the attack. Maneuver space was initially taken for granted, rather than thought of something that would have to be created through larger breaches in a deep, anchored line. ^2 Original Deep Battle theory still sought the 'knock-out blow' of earlier wars; but by the end of the initial period of theorizing several individuals, such as Tukhachevsky, were already reaching the conclusion that this would be an impossible goal in a modern, total war.^3The purges that swept the RKKA in the 1930s took minds like Tukhachevsky away, or silenced them. This meant that the next natural step in the evolution of Deep Battle - a switch to a more mechanized focus and setting up a *series* of penetrations rather than one, war-ending one, was greatly retarded. The practice would have to be learned under fire, in the years 1941-43. There would be many false starts. Early application of the theory would underestimate the mass needed to effect penetrations. At the divisional level, Soviet Rifle groups would often be attacking on too broad a front, and it would require several attacks by multiple echelons to achieve penetration. This would be both time consuming and costly, and allow the Germans to move hitherto spread reserves into positions of concentration from which to seal off Soviet breakthroughs before they could become problematic. ^4 The problem of deployment was also a problem of experience, commander skill (at all levels) and simple organization. The Red Army, very much in an emergency state in the winter of 1941 was using formations developed in the late 1930s based around a strong, robust Officer Corps - which had been largely bled white in that same time period. Formations weren't just attacking on too broad a front, they were too large, too unwieldy for the very mixed bag of RKKA commanders to apply universally. The next great step towards creating a series of mini-battles of encirclement was to downsize the rosters of rifle divisions and get rid of the over-large Corps meant to exploit penetrations. From there, bitter loss and the stern lecturer of battle would refine the RKKA's skill in deploying these streamlined formations. Goals became more realistic; and the first true evidence of shifting to smaller, more manageable, but equally decisive penetrations and encirclement emerge in the year 1943. The practice was 'established' so to speak during the Stalingrad counterattacks, in which the Russian General staff were able to convince Stalin to embark upon two smaller, more manageable penetrations. The idea of deception^5, often touted but rarely performed with much grace during the Winter of 1941/42, was also seen in a satisfactory form. Not only would the Soviets mass the proper amounts of forces to first penetrate, then widen the battle-scape (what the US Combined Arms School refers to as reaching 'operational depth' or 'operational complexity') they would be able to do so in *secret.* The German reserves, what little they had, were never able to concentrate in time to effectively seal off the numerous penetrations. The smaller, more-realistic scope of the operations around Stalingrad also allowed the Soviet's Mechanized corps to form proper blocking positions to prevent relief. Preventing a failure that was all too common to see in earlier counterattacks: Germans breaking into, or out of, pockets.^6 ___^1:  > \"Soviet military theorists pondered the nature of modern war and specific dilemmas of the First World War, the most important of which was how to restore mobility and  maneuver to the....stagnant battlefield.

Soviet Deception often entailed some or all of these elements:  > 1. Concealing the actual movement and preparations for the movement of troops and supplies into the concentration area. This included concealing facilities for storage of fuel and supplies, troop shelters, road and bridge construction, etc. > 2. Strictly limiting movement of these forces or supply units during the daytime. > 3. Camouflage of the assembly positions and dispositions of the attack force. > 4. Elimination of battle reconnaissance by units of the attacking force. > 5. Strict radio silence of all arriving units, especially mobile forces. > 6. No firing of artillery that was designated for the support of the attack for registration purposes. Registration was accomplished by having roving batteries or already sited guns provide this information. > 7. Deceptive measures regarding operations of radio and other communication means. > 8. Limiting knowledge of counteroffensive plans to as few people as possible. > 9.

The history of Confederate Monuments in towns and cities can be broken into a few phases (None of this applies to monuments placed on battlefields).First, in the immediate aftermath of the war, you see a strong focus on memorialization of the fallen. Up until around 1885 or so, the largest number monuments erected are in cemeteries of Confederate dead. This is often organized by Ladies\u2019 Memorial Association, and quite a few erected in conjunction with Confederate Memorial Day celebrations. Many of these monuments didn't take the form of soldier statues, but rather forms often associated closely with memorialization, such as obelisks. Evaluating the monuments erected in the 1865-1885 period, Foster approximates that 70 percent of them were placed in cemeteries, and an overwhelming 90 percent incorporated, \"either in placement or design\", what he describes as \"funereal aspect[s]\" or \"ceremonial bereavement\". Not to say that this was universally true, statues were erected in this period too, but it was not the main focus as we'll see in the ensuing decades.In the 'second wave' of Confederate monuments, beginning in the late 1880s, there is less *memorialization* vis-a-vis *commemoration*, if you can appreciate the distinction. The immediate pain of loss now diminished, and the shame of defeat felt by southern manhood less stinging, revitalization of Southern character now became more and more central to memory of the war. In this period, the statues are placed in more prominent places and take forms much more representative of the Confederate soldier himself. This is when you start to see the quintessential \"Johnny Reb on the Courthouse Steps\" or \"Boy in Butternut in the Town Square\". This coincides with the rise of veterans organizations, principally the United Confederate Veterans, formed in 1889, as well as commemorative associations, principally the Sons of Confederate Veterans (1896) and United Daughters of the Confederacy (1894) the latter of which would play one of the strongest roles especially after the turn of the century, as the veterans themselves began to die off, and the women were unable to partake in the \"shared experience [and memory] of combat\" that helped *men* of the South find reconciliation. These statues were generally sponsored by these groups, and often erected as part of reunion events, or celebrations of the Confederacy. In this period, from 1886 to 1899, Foster calculated that roughly 60 percent of monuments erected now featured soldiers, and only half were being placed in cemeteries, with courthouses, townhalls, or central areas in town gaining prominence. Bereavement became less of a theme as well, with only 40 percent now incorporating funerary themes in some way. This would only continue to increase over the next decade and a half, until the pace of new monuments began to slow in the mid-1910s. Many authors focus on the Spanish-American War's central role in a revitalization of Southern manhood, giving them vindication on the battlefield, and this helping to spur on even more interest at home in the open celebration of the Southern military tradition, well borne out by the increased pace of statues and monuments going up. Again dipping into Foster's calculations, in looking at the monuments from 1900 to 1912, commemoration is the vast majority. 80 percent of monuments in this period are of soldiers, and less than 25 percent evoke themes of bereavement. Cemeteries are quite passe at this point for placement, and 85 percent were erected in the town or city, rather than the graveyard. This point also accounts for the vast majority of all Confederate monuments up to this period, including roughly 3/5 of the ones placed before 1913. Statues would continue to be erected here and there, but that was the end of the big wave, coinciding both with the passing of the fiftieth anniversary as well as World War I. An uptick would come about, perhaps obviously, around the centennial of the war, with a new, albeit smaller wave of commemoration in conjunction with the anniversary. The shift over the decades was a reflection of how the South viewed the cause for which it had fought and lost. In the immediate aftermath, we see expression of sentiment for the fallen, while as time goes on and the 'Lost Cause' ideology took on greater form and importance, we see more open commemoration for what one newspaper wrote upon the unveiling of a Jefferson Davis statue, \"typifies the vindication of Mr. Davis and the cause of the Confederacy for which he stood before the world\". The aim for organizations such as the UDC was not merely to memorialize the fallen, but to craft and shape their legacy, downplaying or misconstruing the more uncomfortable aspects of Confederate history in favor of lionization of the soldiers and leadership as men of honor and principle.I'm mostly relying on Ghosts of the Confederacy: Defeat, the Lost Cause, and the Emergence of the New South by Gaines M. Foster, but I would also recommend the following for a lot more discussion of Civil War memory:* Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory by David Blight* Cities of the Dead: Contesting the Memory of the Civil War in the South, 1865-1914 by William Blair* Causes Won, Lost,  &  Forgotten by Gary W.

The House of Wisdom itself, although being famous both in its time and in the modern day, was never a formalized learning institution like a university.  It instead was operated in much the same way as education as a whole had been operated for hundreds of years and, after the fall of the House of Wisdom in the Siege of Baghdad in 1258, would continue to operate.  The House of Wisdom merely had the added benefit of being a well-funded, centralized hub for learning - similar to how a modern university town may attract a more educated population.#*How Education Worked*When teaching occurred within the House of Wisdom, it was largely under the individual tutelage of learned scholars.  This meant that the teaching was an agreement between the teacher and the student, not the result of any sort of institutionalized panel that accepted or rejected candidates.  Rather, the teaching within the House of Wisdom would have been part of a more decentralized *\u1e25alaqa* system, gradually morphing into a more structured (but still not completely institutionalized) *madrasa* system.*\u1e24alaqa* literally means *circle* or *ring* and its name denotes how the system works.  A Master would sit in a circle with his students and go through various treatises providing commentary.  Students could then ask questions, either to the Master himself or to the various advanced students who acted as sorts of Teaching Assistants. This dialogue between teachers and students, rather than mere book learning, ensured that students would prove that they had mastered the material.  Although I'm most familiar with the system for teaching Islamic law, the system for mathematics and other sciences would have been similar.  These circles would have existed almost anywhere that there was a local q\u0101\u1e0d\u012b or other learned man, typically within the local mosque.  However, an ambitious student would not have restricted himself to one circle.  He could have attended multiple in the same city or, in many cases, traveled to more famous cities to seek the tutelage of a particularly renowned master.  While local circles were often open to all who wanted to attend, they did get more selective as you \"moved up\" to more and more famous teachers.  In these cases, students could bring versions of a \"letter of recommendation\" from another scholar, asking that the new teacher accept the student.  However meritocratic this system may have been, the downside to these circles was that you needed to still pay to support yourself (or attract a private donor to pay for you).  This, among other reasons, led to the establishment of *madrasas*.#*Funding*Around the 8th century, certain mosques began to supply salaries for both their teachers and students.  This role then got coopted by *Waqfs*, or charitable funds, that were set up to supply the funding for these institutions. Throughout the Islamic world, it was common for both men and women to will their money or land after death to the perpetuation of these *waqfs*, often specifying that the money be used to support education.  Gradually, this morphed into the *madrasa* system of education.  What differentiates the *\u1e25alaqa* and *madrasa* system is largely the level of independence enjoyed by the teacher.  Wael Hallaq largely criticizes the *madrasa* for this very reason, saying that it was: >  \"as much, if not more, a financial and a political phenomenon as it was an educational one, and it subjected legal education to increasingly systematic control by rulers\".  The House of Wisdom itself actually fell victim to this sort of control.  Caliph Ma\u02bem\u016bn, who really jump-started the House of Wisdom, pumping in funding and emphasizing learning, was a member of the Mu\u02bftazila school of thought.  Although now largely defunct, this school were extreme rationalists, with Caliph Ma\u02bem\u016bn going so far as to launch an inquisition, the *mi\u1e25na*, forcing scholars to attest to the fact that the Qur\u02bean was created and not eternal.  Although this repression succeeded during his reign, and partially for the reigns of the following 2 Caliphs, there was a backlash under the Caliph Mutawakkil.  Al-Mutawakkil held to a much stricter, more fundamentalist interpretation of religion and openly persecuted scholars who had even just ties to the Mu\u02bftizilis, such as the \"Father of Islamic Philosophy\", Al-Kindi.Getting back to funding, in addition to the *waqf* institutes providing grants for teacher and student salaries and living expenses, scholars could earn *generous* stipends from local notables for supplying new translations of works, inventions, or astronomical calculations.  The Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101, who I'll talk about below, reportedly would pay 500 Dinars a month - roughly $18,000 - $20,000 in todays money - to top translators.The Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101 themselves, or Sons of Moses, are interesting to note here.  These three brothers - Muhammad, Ahmad, and Hassan - had been the sons of the astrologer of the Caliph Ma\u02bem\u016bn.  When their father died while they were still young, the Caliph then paid for their own education, giving them access to the finest private tutors in the Caliphate.  The brothers later become accomplished engineers, writing *The Book of Ingenious Devices* which included, among other things, a robotic flute player that operated off variations in air and water pressure.  While they would have come from an educated family, seeing as their father was the court astronomer, this example does show how notables could sponsor the educations of those they viewed as worthy.However, this shouldn't be taken to mean that education was completely meritocratic.  It was still much easier for a wealthy family to educate their child than for a poor child to rise up to a position of power (although it could happen).#*Religious Status*Finally, we get to religion.  Education was not restricted to Muslims during the time of the House of Wisdom.  However, the ability for a religious minority to rise to a position of true power did rely, to a degree, on the relative tolerance of the currently ruling Caliph. The first example I want to give is of Hunayn al-Ish\u0101q, a Christian translator who, after being introduced to the Caliph Ma\u02bem\u016bn by the Ban\u016b M\u016bs\u0101 in 817, reportedly rose to become the director of the entire House of Wisdom by 830.  He actually lasted through 9 different Caliphs despite never converting!  Other scholars were known to have considered converting for social gain, but it wasn't necessary for all.  Certain types of professions actually tended to be dominated by minorities, with Jim Khalili reporting that most of the physicians of 8th and 9th century Baghdad were Jewish and Christian.But not all Caliphs were as tolerant.  The aforementioned Caliph Mutawakkil passed a decree in 850 in which, among other restrictions, he: >  forbade their being employed in the government offices or in any official business whereby they might have authority over Muslims. He prohibited their children [from] studying in Muslim schools. Nor was any Muslim permitted to teach them.This didn't stop converts from being able to prosper however, as evidenced by Ali ibn Sahl, a Jewish convert to Islam who tutored the famous doctor al-R\u0101z\u012b under the reign of Caliph Mutawakkil.  If one didn't want to convert, then there would be significant barriers in their way to achieving education or power.#*Conclusion and TL;DR*All in all, the House of Wisdom would have been most likely funded by the Caliph, especially under Ma\u02bem\u016bn.  If a student had proven himself in his local *\u1e25alaqa* circles or had caught the eye of an influential patron, he could have traveled to Baghdad to study under one of the Masters and, when there, would have most likely been supported by either that private patron or by a *waqf* endowment. Finally, while it wasn't strictly necessary to be Muslim under most Caliphs, barriers were occasionally put in place that would have prevented non-converts from rising too high in government.Well, that got a bit away from me but I hope it wasn't too meandering and that it provides a bit of an answer to your question.  If you have any questions please let me know and I'll try to get back to them!**Sources***Pathfinders: The Golden Age of Arab Science* by Jim Khalili*An Introduction to Islamic Law* by Wael HallaqThe Decree of Caliph al-Mutawakkil was recorded by al-Tabiri.Edit: Transliteration", "label": 0}, {"content": "The House of Wisdom was a university in Baghdad, Iraq, that was founded in the early 10th century.

Unsurprisingly, the biggest difference is whether the media figure is themself a PMD or not--but not just for the obvious reason.You see, the PMD version of the apocalypse is not only not a literal interpretation of Revelation, but it's not even just Revelation or all of Revelation. It mashes together out-of-order bits of Revelation, Daniel, Ezekiel, and random verses elsewhere in accordance with some acid-trip \"Bible code\" theology arising out of the 19th century. This is relevant here for two reasons. First, a lot of the supposed pre-Rapture (also not really a biblical concept as such) international political warning signs come from Daniel and Ezekiel, not Revelation. Second, it means that the actual progression of Armageddon *is* a code--a code known only to true believers. So non-fundamentalist Christians *can't* see the same warning signs that PMDs do; they can only bring their own ideas of apocalypse and project those ideas onto apocalypticists.First we're going to look at a PMD perspective. Once upon a time, believe it or not, the apocalypse was slated to start on August 23, 1939. You might recognize that date as the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, that is, the neutrality treaty between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. Yes, Germany and Russia, those *well known* biblical antagonists.To 1930s PMDs, of course, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact as a herald of the apocalypse had nothing to do with the fact that Hitler and Stalin were evil. If you know ~~Cthulhu~~ Rapture mythos, you probably see the names of two countries in the context of Apocalypse Soon and jump to Ezekiel's Gog and Magog right away. The PMDs certainly were. Russia had a long-established role as either Gog or Magog probably going back to medieval Alexander legends, but it was in full force by the 1930s: >  No other nation on earth does so completely ft into the divine portraiture of a completely anti-God nation as does modern Russia. If, as all signs clearly indicate, we are at the closing hour of Gentile domination on this earth, than what other nation could possibly be the 'Gog' of Ezekiel\u2019s prophecy if Russia is not?Make no mistake: other people's fears of Communism and fascism aside, PMDs were *gleeful* about the alliance. They believed it prophesied their longed-for apocalypse, which has a spiritual function in fundamentalist Christianity we shouldn't ignore, but is *also* a sharp-edged triumphalist, exceptionalist weapon--a way to delineate Us and Them in the most cosmic way possible, and in advance of the Rapture, a way to say \"nanny nanny boo boo we were right.\"Fundamentalists reading their own ideas into the actions of international leaders isn't the same thing as identifying their government as making plans to deal with God's Anti-Prime Directive. But the chance to brag about being right flipped the lever here. L.A. pastor and author Louis Bauman wrote, \"Theunregenerate of this world\u2019s intelligentsia havelong assured us that Germany and Russia could never march togetherto battle.\" In other words, governments had *no* preparations for the apocalypse. Others were more explicit. Preacher Harold John Ockenga exulted that *only* true students of the Bible had long warned of a Germany-USSR alliance that would make Armageddon \"closer than we expect.\" And Dan Gilbert went so far as to lament that \"if only\" governments had been aware of what the Bible truly said, they could have prepared for the pact and the divinely-driven devastation that would follow. (Not, of course, the *actual* and very human devastation that in fact followed.)So in this case, we can see the PMD method of biblical interpretation--reading into events--combined with triumphalism resulting in the public position that the government did *not* have any kind of plans to deal with Antichrist. At this point in time, PMD theology was a fringe belief in the sense of it being numerically small but also in terms of its public discourse presence. On the other side of Hal Lindsey's *Late Great Planet Earth* and during the Cold War presidency of fundamentalists' darling Ronald Reagan, however, the public voice of PMD theology echoed everywhere.Nuclear weapons are, like Germany and Russia, another matter with a *dazzling* prevalence throughout the Bible. But (at least prior to global warming becoming a horrible and very human-caused actuality), the post-World War II popular idea of apocalypse meant nuclear bombs. And so, believe it or not, Armageddon became a pressing issue in the 1984 presidential election.Journalists pressed Reagan again and again about his nuclear proliferation policies, giving voice to what they presented as a public worry that he was actively maneuvering to bring about Armageddon. The New York Times worried about his references to Russia (always Russia!) as \"satanic\", and mentions of a \"final battle.\" And from an NBC interview: >  *Reporter*: YourPentagon and your Secretary of Defense have plans for the UnitedStates to fght and prevail in a nuclear war. Do you feel that we are nowheading, perhaps, for some kind of nuclear Armageddon? And do youfeel that this country and the world could survive that kind of calamity? >  *Reagan*: I think what has been hailed as something I\u2019m supposedly,as President, discussing...he prophecies down through the years, the biblical prophecies of what would portend the coming of Armageddon and so forth. And the fact that a number of theologians for the last decade or more have believed that this was true, that the prophecies are coming together that portend that. But no one knows whether Armageddon\u2014thoseprophecies\u2014mean that Armageddon is a thousand years away or dayafter tomorrow. So I have never seriously warned and said we must plan according to Armageddon.Most people since have concluded that even if Reagan's religiosity was as sincere as conservative Christians make it out to be, he was categorically not trying to bring about Armageddon in his own lifetime, much less under his watch as president. He's on record elsewhere of suggesting--in *actual* biblical fashion--that we can't know when God will end the world, and the role of Christians is to fight evil.But even that, I think, is less revealing than the manner in which non-PMD reporters addressed the possibility of apocalypse. Not by reading a pre-existing mythology into world news, but looking at world news and identifying things that could be apocalypse--*then* projecting those ideas onto a particular apocalyptic mythology. And that while our 1939 PMDs relished the coming destruction and being proven right, these reporters were more concerned for, you know, people dying.Further Reading:* Matthew Sutton, *American Apocalypse: A History of Modern Evangelism* (2014) is good if you want a readable but academic overview of PMD theology as it plays out in contact with secular society, but...* ...really what you want is Fred Clark's (slacktivist) takedown of the Left Behind books, [an index of which you can find here](_URL_0_)", "label": 0}, {"content": "The United States has never had a contingency plan for the biblical apocalypse.

That presupposes a great deal of cooperation on the part of the weather, plus doesn't take into account that Parma's transports, embarking in shallow water off the coast, would be threatened by the shallow-draft ships of the Dutch navy (neither the English nor the Spanish could come to grips in the shoals).  In the event, the English fleet successfully harassed the Spanish through the channel, scattered them with fire-ships near Dunkirk and pursued them north into the North Sea, where the English admirals, running low on ammunition, assumed the Spanish would make port and re-arm themselves.

This started relatively soon after the end of the queen's reign, with those in the late 1910s and 1920s seeing themselves as part of a \"post-Victorian\" age that was starkly different from what had come before. Anti-victorianism has largely been studied in the context of early twentieth century writers like those of the Bloomsbury Group - Virginia Woolf, Vita Sackville-West, T. S. Eliot, et al. - who distinguished themselves or who were distinguished by others as being intentionally anti-Victorian, or whose pro-Victorian sentiments need to be examined beyond simply being considered conservatism. These writers generally came of age around the turn of the century, spent their childhoods in middle- or upper-class Victorian households, and went on to become an educated, elite group that conspicuously spurned the mores and standards of their parents' generation, which to them represented the whole of the Victorian era despite being a highly skewed view of the entire period and all of the people in it. This backlash coexisted, however, with a nostalgia for (depending on one's age) the period of one's childhood or one's parents' childhood. You can compare this to the modern view of the 1950s - to some people, that decade is a time of backward social views and overly restrictive clothing, and to others, it's a glorious haven of innocence and beauty.Aesthetically, the 1890s represented a lot of things that wouldn't and possibly couldn't come back. The dominant mainstream decorative arts movement was Art Nouveau, characterized by shapes in wood, stone, metal, and textiles with [sinuous curves and unexpected proportions](_URL_1_); while only the affluent could afford seriously *art nouveau* pieces for their homes, influence from it could be found in more mundane, utilitarian furniture and advertising/object packaging for the masses. Even when avant-garde artists like the Impressionists or Post-Impressionists rejected straightforwardly representational art, they still created works  that involved [great attention to detail](_URL_7_) and [were clearly representing something](_URL_0_). Women's clothing [during the day](_URL_8_) was enveloping, generally involving a high collar, sleeves with a varying degree of fullness, a firmly-shaped figure, and long skirts, typically stiffened a bit at the hem in order to stand out; among women who were in a position to wear evening dress, that followed the same general lines and was often [ornate and very well-made](_URL_6_). By contrast, the following decades had a very different material culture. \"Smooth, streamlined, and geometric\" essentially describes Art Deco and related early-twentieth-century styles like [Bauhaus](_URL_4_) or [Wiener Werkstatte](_URL_11_): with no relationship to Art Nouveau's organic forms, or to previous artistic movements, they were completely modern. More and more abstracted artistic styles like [Fauvism](_URL_2_), [Cubism](_URL_12_), and [Surrealism](_URL_9_) looked senseless and undetailed to many viewers. Women's dress was more lightweight and flimsy, covering less of the body and worn over fewer and more flexible undergarments; ready-made dresses were more available and common than ever before, helping to bring in a standard of looser and less precise fit. From about 1915 to 1930, the fashionable female figure was a lightly-shaped tube, and even when a more shapely form came into vogue again, it didn't seem quite as emphatic as the corseted one. (I've written about views of the Victorian corset during this period [here](_URL_3_).)So, aesthetically, these eras are pretty much opposites, just as the 1950s and today are. If someone didn't like the modern aesthetic, the clearest place for them to turn to find a \"better\" one (more to their traditionalist taste) was the 1890s.As you can see, I've left quite a bit of room for someone to talk about politics and business!", "label": 0}, {"content": "The 1890s were a time of great change and uncertainty.

The Mongol identity as we understand it today did not exist. All of the various tribes of the Eurasian steppes had been warring with each other for thousands of years, usually due to Chinese intervention. China recognized the danger of a unified barbarian army, so it played the tribes off one another to keep them divided. However, China made a fatal mistake when it backed a khan named Temujin. The Song Dynasty originally supported Temujin in a power play, using him to dispose of another rising khan who was also trying to unite the steppe tribes. Turns out, Temujin was very good at doing his job. Too good. He eventually did the impossible by ending centuries long blood feuds and uniting all the tribes under a single, monolithic identity. For this, he was given the title of Genghis Khan, or Supreme Leader.The most significant custom that Temujin broke was nepotism. After ascending to power, he did not follow the Mongol custom of appointing close relatives and friends into choice roles. Instead, he fostered a meritocracy. His great eye for talent and his lack of bias led to the appointments of his three greatest generals -- Muqali, Jebe, and Subutai.Muqali was an ethnic Jurchen (rulers of the Jin Dynasty and sworn enemies of the Mongols) who was once a servant for a rival khan. Jebe was also from a rival tribe. After his tribe was defeated, he boldly admitted to *shooting Genghis Khan in the neck* during battle. Temujin immediately offered him a position in his khanate. Although Subutai was the humble son of a blacksmith, Genghis Khan recognized his natural talent and groomed him for leadership. Subutai ended up becoming the greatest of all his generals. Because Genghis Khan established this tradition of meritocracy, even a conquered soldier of lowly birth could rise to great power as long as he displayed talent and ingenuity.There were good opportunities to display talent and ingenuity, too. The Mongol soldier was not supposed to be a drone. Genghis Khan did not like micromanagement and discouraged it for all his commanders. Mongol soldiers enjoyed a good amount of freedom and loose interpretation with orders. As long as they completed their objective, it didn't matter to commanders how they did it. This meant that the rank-and-file soldiers who were able to complete their missions quickly, efficiently, and creatively were recognized and pegged for possible promotions. Cunning commanders could also hope to become generals regardless of their origin or ethnicity.The Mongols were also deeply shaped by the harsh lifestyle in the steppes. Wars between tribes were ceaseless and rape was a fact of life. When women were captured among rivals, which happened frequently, they were almost always returned pregnant. On battle campaigns, the typical nomad's diet was mare's milk, horse blood, and some meat. All Mongols were able to ride for days without stopping, sleeping in their saddles and swapping mounts when needed. They were stunned by the luxuries of sedentary life. \"Going native\" was a recurring threat for all steppe conquerors, not just the Mongols. The Jurchen eradicated the Liao Dynasty and established the Jin Dynasty a hundred years before Genghis Khan's rise to power. They were bred out within a few generations because none of them lived on the steppes anymore. Genghis Khan knew that there must always be Mongols living in the steppes if they were to maintain their military dominance.Growing up on the steppes gave all Mongols skill sets that translated well into war. There was no arable land, skirmishes were rampant, they had to move constantly, and they were born and raised with horses. The composite bows they wielded have a draw of 160 pounds, and each soldier carried 150 arrows in his quiver. They were able to loose their entire payload within five minutes under pressing conditions. The soldiers were also taught to shoot on horseback, trained specifically to loose their arrows only when all four feet of the horse were off the ground so that their aim would not be disrupted. The average Mongol soldier was able to shoot out a bird in flight while mounted and in full gallop. Women were the ones who taught all Mongol children how to shoot and ride, so we must also assume that they were close to if not just as skilled as the men. In comparison, soldiers of other armies at the time must've seemed far less skilled to a Mongol archer. For a Mongol, these were skills that were needed simply to survive on the steppes. The average soldier anywhere else was trained in combat for a few months after conscription. This pales in comparison to a Mongol who's been riding and shooting from the age of six.But for all of Genghis Khan's genius, he was not a kind man. If anyone could be called a Stalin or Hitler of his time, it was without a doubt Genghis Khan. There are no official death tolls from his campaigns but there are two census statements from the Jin Dynasty, one a year before Genghis Khan's invasion and another a few years after. There is a discrepancy of roughly 30 million missing people. This disappearance is not explained. Many may have fled to other areas, but even for modern population sizes, those numbers are absolutely staggering. The death toll resulting from all the Khan's conquests put together approaches somewhere around 50 million. Some of the Muslim and Nestorian Christian soldiers in his army were against the extremely harsh ways the Mongols executed and subjugated conquered people. Depending on what you believed, it could have been taxing on your morality. There was a retinue of Turkish diplomats who were sent by the Khwarezmian Shah to seek an audience with Genghis Khan, with the clandestine mission of spying on him. When they approached Jin, which Genghis Khan had recently conquered, they saw a white mountain on the horizon. As they got closer, they saw that it was a giant pile of white, bleached bones. Human bones. The ground was also rancid and swamped with grease from all the dead flesh that had slogged off and rotted into the dirt. The grease was so thick that their horses could not properly trot over the ground and they were forced to take an alternative route.On the whole, life as the average Mongol soldier must have been good. He was a member of the greatest army in the world led by, in my opinion, the greatest general who ever lived. He came from a very hostile, resource scarce environment and conquered civilizations overflowing with riches and comforts that were beyond his wildest fantasies. Regardless of his religion, social standing, or birth, he had the opportunity to rise through the ranks out of pure talent.

Both countries have quite small populations. I know more about Botswana though so will focus on that. Botswana had several things going for it: colonial incursion compared to other parts of British colonial Africa were minimal. Diamonds and other precious minerals were not found in any substantial degree until after WWII. It was also set up by the British in the nineteenth century as a special protectorate where white settlement was banned, so neither colonial settlers nor colonial economic exploitation ever really took hold in the ways it did in other parts of the world. In other words, Botswana was an insignificant and neglected backwater (from a colonial perspective), which meant at indepedence it was one of the poorest places in the world.I'm simplifying somewhat but basically around the time if independence, diamonds and other precious mineral were discovered. They ended up with elected officials who were largely very successful at investing these resources in education and developing other aspects of a state infrastructure. The relatively small and homogenous size of the population made this easier. It is difficult to read about Seretse Khama's lengthy presidency and not want to celebrate his achievements in assuring Botswana managed the transition to successful liberal democracy with some ease and has not shared the violence of many of its neighbours.I now want to make a major caviat about everything I've just written. It's too simplistic. While this is the general narrative, it's worth bearing in mind that the nomad people of the Kalahari Desert were largely marginalised in both Namibia and Botswana (traditionally their residence spanned both), denied access to education and generally have faced discrimination. Botswana recently has suffered, like most of southern Africa, from incredibly high rates of HIV - perhaps up to 25% of the population. In addition to this, some of the image of success may also be down to a lack of research compared to other parts of Africa. In Botswana, historians have largely focused on WWII, the love story of Seretse Khama and Ruth Williams in Botswana, and the shenanigans of the US and South Africa and Britain interferring because of uranium in the 1950s and 1960s. And just fundamentally, it's nice to think that African countries don't have to be basket cases, that a success like Botswana is possible. Botswanans themselves take a lot of pride in this image of their country, which probably further helps keep corruption down and retain peace.

After Reconstruction ended white-lead governments surged back into power and used their power to marginalize the black vote.  They then used that power to enact Jim Crow laws which further suppressed black political activity and relegated black people to second class status.

They also brought heating to big stone houses (type \"mansion\" if you will).  Well, the wooden houses of the \"natives\" didn't need no heating.  But you had to go into the forest to take a dump.- Better mills.  But also lots of troops who demanded grain-based rations instead of the more meat based diet of most \"natives\".Well?  Things just changed, for better or worse is truly in the eye of the beholder.- Trade, you trade with the empire from outside or from the inside, doesn't make a difference, the market is there.**Political stability.**  This is the biggie.  This is what makes me answer your question with \"yes\".Because of this, military service became a profession and you didn't have to do it.  This is a huge thing in my eyes.  Think about the alternative: every few years your tribe has to defend itself against another tribe for some petty reason.  You were caught in this and had to fight.  Many lost their lives for virtually nothing.Inside the empire you could have a civilian trade and be virtually untouched of the fighting.  Much like us today.  Pretty neat, if you ask me.Political stability also meant developing markets.  For instance in Italy itself the economy developed towards a slave-labour based great plantations.  This was only possible because for centuries there was no fighting and the empire and the city were growing and so on.For example, Lisbon was exporting \"cans\" of fish soup via ship throuout the empire.  So there were people in Olisipio, who had a good income cooking fish soup all day.  Somebody has to keep the pirates at bay for this to work and be economically viable.  Other political powers before the Romans may have done a good job here, but the Romans sure a whack did.This means more economy, different types of economies, because more endevaours became viable.Also the Romans introduced whole new industries to the provinces: education by Greek teachers.  The theater with a big entertainment industry (actors, gladiators, merchandising etc).In other words: the employment possibilities were good.  Much better than in some Celtic town or Germanic cottage.  If you ask me.But again, what is \"better\"?Maybe you can get better answers, if you give more specifics as to what in your mind is \"better\".I say \"yes\" not mainly because you could finally take a bath (specially in Jerusalem and other middle eastern cities you could even before the Romans came), but your career chances improved and you hadn't have to go to 'nam.  So to speak. ----EDIT:This is always a bit hard for me, because I am German, so almost everything I read is out of some obscure German pocket books.  Also I am not a professional historian, so most of my readings consists of writings of (contemporanean) historians and not so much of the sources themselves.  Though, I'll do my best and will add some of my sourcery to this post in the next few hours.- \"The Roman Empire\" by Colin Wells is a classic.  He provides a good general overview.  Regarding our topic at hand, he refers to the careers of Gaius Caecilius Isidorus and Gnaeus Cornelius Lentulus who became what we today would call slef-made millionaires.  His sources are \"Plinius, Naturalis historia 33, 135\") and \"Sueton, Tiberius49;Seneca, De beneficiis 2,27\" respectively.  But he has more to offer in his book. - Regarding the heating of Roman era \"mansions\" I would suggest to take a look at Britain.  There exist a large body of work for the late Roman period, specially to exermine the changes in the living conditions during the transition to Anglosaxon period.  I do not have access to any english book on this, but here is a Wikipedia link to [a source for heating in Roman housing](_URL_2_) in the provinces.- Here is the Wiki link to the [fish sauce of Olisipo](_URL_0_)Lisbon.  Everybody who knows the present city shouldn't be too surprised of this, btw.  Again [on the Wiki we can read](_URL_1_) that transportation costs on sea was 60 times lower than on land.  We can only speculate how this impacted the soup industry in Olisipo, my thinking is that, if we factor reliability into the price, it must have had a positive impact on the size of the industry and also helped for long-term planning.", "label": 0}, {"content": "Living standards in the Roman Empire were generally higher than in the rest of the world.

Dan Carlin is a fan of history, not a historian.  He says as much, and his podcasts are best enjoyed when one keeps that in mind.2.  The historiography of the German-Soviet part of World War II has undergone some serious changes in the last few years.So with that being said, let's start by examining where the ideas of \"the Nazis got in the way of the army\" came from.  Comprehensive books like Alan Clark's \"Barbarossa\" or William Shirer's \"Rise and Fall of the Third Reich\" (a journalist, not historian, mind you) draw heavily on German sources.  Some of those memoirs, like Heinz Guderian's and Erich von Mainstein's were written after the war, and do much to argue that they (the generals) would have won the war if not for meddlers (the politicians, specifically Hitler).  While these men took copious notes and their insights are helpful, they are generals writing to preserve their legacy in the face of military defeat, and only writing from their perspective.  Bias aside, Clark and Shirer do make the argument that high ranking officials competed with each other and created almost fiefdoms in ways that focused more on their personal gain in lieu of the military effort.  Clark is pretty clear that administration of the conquered territories turned populations that should have been hostile to the Soviets against Germany, and that manpower was wasted on subjugation and occupation.Some newer military historians are pushing back on the influence of Hitler himself, and of the high ranking Nazis.  Not only do they point out the problems of having generals assigning blame as a core of sources, but now that they have access to the Soviet archives, they see more of the picture than was available in the past.David M. Glantz and Jonathan House have written incredibly detailed write-ups of the Eastern Front using sources from both sides.  They push back and even point out that politically, Hitler was often right about how other nations would react over protests from his generals.  It was only as the war dragged on that Germany was in too deep and famous miscalculations start popping up (shifting focus to Stalingrad, splitting Army Group South into A and B, changing the table of equipment for Panzer Divisions, and so on).  Glantz even argues that Hitler made the right call in having the Wehrmacht hold their ground during the Soviet offensives in the Winter of 1941-1942.  Both also assign more decisions to the military staff.  They have a great series of lectures that rethink common German claims for defeat on youtube and they are worth checking out if you want to see how the historiography is changing after Soviet archives:_URL_0_ - House addressing the \"three alibis\" for German defeat._URL_1_ - Glantz addressing \"Myths and Realities.\"So, I know that it doesn't answer your question definitively other than to say \"it's complicated,\" but the truth is that there is still a lot of work to do on the German-Soviet side of the conflict.  If you trust primary sources from generals, then Hitler and Nazi meddling was a root cause of defeat. If you trust secondary sources from the 1950's and 1960's, then at least the petty infighting and factionalism in the Nazi government reduced efficiency and manpower available for the war.Current historians are placing less emphasis on German accounts and sources explaining the end of the war, and more on Soviet sources and reasons for results of the conflict.If you are curious about the role of ideology on individual soldiers, I haven't read any analysis into the military impact myself.  Omer Bartov's \"Barbarization of the Eastern Front\" is more about looking at the role of ideology and indoctrination in explaining and exploring the extent of war crimes by regular Infanterie and Panzer divisions.  Chris Browning's \"Ordinary Men\" looks at Reserve Police Battalions and how and to what extent regular men took part in the Holocaust.Sources and works discussed:Primary Sources:Heinz Guderian \"Panzer Leader\" 1952.Erich von Mainstein \"Lost Victories\" 1955.Secondary Sources:William R.

G\u00f6ring was also promoted to Reichsmarschall by Hitler in 1940, making him the highest ranking soldier in all of the German Armed Forces.  This gives you an idea of how highly Hitler regarded G\u00f6ring during the years leading up to and including the first few years of the war.At the end of the war in April, 1945, with Berlin surrounded, Hitler informed the rest of the German High Command that he would be staying in Berlin until the end, at which point he would commit suicide.  G\u00f6ring apparently took this as meaning that Hitler was finished, and that even though he was still alive in his bunker in Berlin, it was time for G\u00f6ring to officially assume command. He sent a telegram to Hitler on April 23 asking if this was the case, and that if he did not hear back by 22:00 that night, he would assume command of the Reich.  This made Hitler furious, and he accused G\u00f6ring of treason, stripping him of all his rank and titles a few days later.

From our perspective, slavery does seem to be profoundly anti-modern, both in light of industrialization and emancipation. But by the 1860s, the extent of these processes was far from obvious. Indeed, slave owners in the mid-nineteenth century constructed their own version of modernity that had slavery at its core. I think you'll find that because of the immediate distraction that was the Civil War, there were fewer articulations of how southerners imagined slavery playing out in the future than one might expect (please prove me wrong, though). However, in the mid-nineteenth century, slave owners' imagined future involved the continual expansion of their slave system. Pro-slavery forces in the 1850s supported filibusters, or non-state military actions, against Cuba and Nicaragua with the hope that they could incorporate these territories into the United States and thereby keep expanding and strengthening the American slave system. To a similar end, by the late 1850s, many southerners schemed to reopen the slave trade. Far from being in a state of decline, southerners perceived the slave system as vibrant. In the historical imagination of the southerners, slavery was both a natural and Godly way of existing. It occupied a place within a Christian eschatology that emphasized the importance of order and peace to the second coming of Christ. In that sense, they expected that slavery would last until Christ returned. On the other hand, the forces of antislavery, many southerners believed, were aligned with the forces of the antichrist, or otherwise a generally disorganizing influence. For example, in an 1861 pamphlet called *Slavery, a divine institution*, a southerner named J.B. Thrasher traced a genealogy of antislavery back to the French Revolution (then widely acknowledged to be a barbaric and dangerous event -- Thrasher attributed anti-slavery to \"the Jacobin clubs of France, during the bloody reign of Robespierre, in which the very dregs of society got possession of the government.\"), the Haitian Revolution, disorganizing parties in England and New England, before arriving in Abraham Lincoln's dangerous brain. In this version of history, it was actually the abolitionists who were backwards, barbaric, and anti-modern. By attempting to destroy slavery, abolitionists were attempting to subvert a natural order, and return mankind to a state of brutality. The course of history, to southern slave owners, was on the side of slavery.Edit: to add a few sources for further reading on this topic:* Walter Johnson, *River of Dark Dreams* (2013).* Matthew Karp, \"'This Vast Southern Empire': The South and the Foreign Policy of Slavery.\" Ph.D. dissertation, University of Pennsylvania, 2011.* J.B.

Many of their projects were canceled, only reached the prototype stage, or came to limited fruition. *Bismarck* and *Tirpitz* were the only vessels of their class completed. The [giant H-39 battleships]( _URL_4_) conceived as a follow on design were canceled. The German aircraft carrier [*Graf Zeppelin*]( _URL_1_) was only partially completed before the project was shelved. Her compliment of [Fi-167 torpedo bombers]( _URL_3_) reached the prototype stage but with no carrier to fly off of were canceled. The last great R & D drive of the Kriegsmarine was the [Type 21 U-boat]( _URL_0_). Only four examples were completed in time to carry out war patrols but they would form the basis of later NATO and Soviet designs. Arguably the most successful, and definitely most secret weapon created by Kriegsmarine R & D however was the Type 7 LS U-boat. These were a series of regular type 7 U-boat which traded most of their torpedo capacity for additional battery banks to improve their underwater endurance. Beginning in mid-1942 they were employed in one of the most daring operations of the entire war, Maritime Kampagne Eisdrachen (Maritime Campaign Ice Dragon). Maritime Kampagne Eisdrachen was an attempt to render the increasingly small North Atlantic Gap deadly to allied shipping again. Allied Maritime air power was constantly extending its reach into the gap and conventional U-boat operations were increasingly dangerous. Maritime Kampagne Eisdrachen used the new long range U-boat in a brilliant plan to even the odds. The Eisdrachen boats would deploy in the Arctic where they would use explosive charges to cut loose icebergs which would strike Allied shipping. Even unsuccessful icebergs were a hazard to Allied logistics, costing valuable days as the convoys were forced to sail around them. The icebergs proved a deadly hazard to allied shipping. Many of the small, slow, prewar ships could neither withstand nor avoid the newly floating ice sheets. Even the much larger liberty ships were not immune. The *SS Carl Thusgaard* which foundered in 1943 and the *SS J. Pinckney Henderson* which was badly damaged in a collision off the coast of Newfoundland are among the ships now believed to have been lost as a result of Maritime Kampagne Eisdrachen. The last casualties of the war not tied to unexploded bombs or mines are also believed to have been victims of an iceberg strike. Three sailors drowned aboard the *SS Charles S. Haight* when she was wrecked of the coast of Cape Ann in 1946. Karl D\u00f6nitz secrecy precautions were so effective Maritime Kampagne Eisdrachen was only discovered after the war when allied analysts were going through the files recovered from the German navy compound. The Type 7 LS only ever sailed under hand delivered orders. No radio transmissions were ever made to the submarines during a mission. To avoid detection of their construction the submarines used off the shelf batteries from other U-boats. For their explosives they used the reliable 88 \u00d7 571 mm. R shell modified enroute with a timed detonator. D\u00f6nitz believed, correctly, that a small number of missing 88 shells would go unnoticed. To make their escape from France the Eisdrachen boats used a daring technique to escape detection. Once submerged the U-boats made the English Channel dash under battery power where they knew the English patrolled relentlessly with surface ships. By doing so they avoided the growing specter of long range Atlantic airpower.To avoid the discovery of their mission even if the U-boats were spotted the Eisdrachen submariners used a two pronged stratagem. One half of the boats planted their modified shells on the underside of the ice sheets with divers in canvas diving suits. Although they had to work fast because of the limited supply of oxygen available to them from the submarine\u2019s tether they were very effective. A half dozen shells could easily blow loose a 300 meter iceberg. The other half deployed teams to the surface who disguised their actions as the deployment of weather monitoring stations [such as this one]( _URL_2_). Even when the stations were discovered by the Allies their true purpose was disguised. I\u2019ve posted some background sources here but the full story of Maritime Kampagne Eisdrachen only appears in *Axis blockade runners of World War II* by Martin Hubert Brice. His interviews with the survivors of the tense run through the English Channel are amazing. It\u2019s a semi-rare book but I highly recommend it if you can find a copy. **MASSIVE EDIT: Ladies and Gentlemen this post is a joke. I hope you have enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed writing it.

The journey was a logistical nightmare for a Russian navy that was largely designed to fight in European waters. The inexperience of the fleet, coupled with panic over Japanese sneak attack led to various scares during the travel that the fleet was under attack. Some of this was comical, such as when the repair ship *Kamchatka* fell behind the fleet for engine problems off of Africa, and when she returned, mistakenly signaled she was under attack by torpedo boats. Other incidents were more serious, such as when at Dogger Bank, the fleet mistook a group of British fishing trawlers for Japanese torpedo boats and opened fire, killing three British fisherman. The logistical nightmare of operating a coal-powered fleet at such distances added further confusion to the fleet, as machinery broke down and men had to operate in tropical conditions they were not prepared for. The fleet's admiral forbid the opening of portholes for security against would be Japanese torpedo boats, and the result was the ships became sweatboxes. Not only men, but also officers often slept naked and the heat swelled the wooden furnishings on the ships. Fresh water was a scarce resource, so rainstorms became one of the ways for the crews to bathe and alleviate the rashes on their skin caused by the heat. Cleanliness and discipline often broke down, which was a shock to the fleet's commander Rozhestvensky, who was a more conservative flag officer. But despite all of these problems, the fleet made it to East Asian waters after an eight month voyage, only to sail into the Japanese battlefleet. The naturally slow pace of Rozhestvensky's fleet made it easy for the Japanese to prepare to meet it, and Admiral Togo managed to put his fleet in a position where it could intercept the Russians. The resulting battle was quite lopsided, with the Russian ships being much less modern than the Japanese, and crewed by very tired men. The Russian fleet lost all of its eleven battleships, four of its eight cruisers, and six of its nine destroyers. In exchange, the Japanese only lost three torpedo boats.

But other non-alcoholic drinks were readily available. They had to be. One of America's early sizable communities were the Quakers, who were teetotalers.All the links below link back to the letters, receipts, and publications of various Founding Fathers/Mothers in the late 18th Century, including Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, James Madison, John Adams, and Abigail Adams, describing their non-alcoholic beverage habits.On the occasion when people weren't drinking alcohol, then the drinks of choice were tea ([1](_URL_8_), [2](_URL_1_), [3](_URL_20_)), coffee ([1](_URL_9_), [2](_URL_10_), [3](_URL_14_)), water ([1](_URL_12_), [2](_URL_4_), [3](_URL_24_)), and milk ([1](_URL_13_), [2](_URL_6_), [3](_URL_11_)). (You'll need to CTRL+F the beverage in question to see the relevant section of those Founding Fathers' papers.)Of those four non-alcoholic beverages, milk was probably the least frequently consumed by adults, but it nonetheless was. John Adams even went on a [milk and bread diet](_URL_6_) at one point. Tea consumption was widespread, as evident by the famous \"Boston Tea Party\". Less well remembered are the protests in other port cities against the Tea Act. It's been estimated that about [6.5 million pounds of tea](_URL_21_) were being imported to the Thirteen Colonies annually by the time of the Revolution. This out of a population of 2.5 million people means that, if a pound of tea yields 200 cups, then, on average, an American was drinking 520 cups of tea per year.Historians from the colonial period may also be familiar with the Founders' love of coffee. Coffee-houses were ubiquitous in America's largest cities, including Boston, New York, and Philadelphia. They were often used as meeting places for politicians and other prominent men. Probably the most famous coffee house of colonial America was New York's Tontine Coffee-House, which was at the corner of Wall Street and Water Street in downtown Manhattan. It was frequented by traders, merchants, and brokers, a group of whom signed a document in 1792 called the Buttonwood Agreement that was the genesis of the New York Stock Exchange.A good example of what the Founders were consuming can be seen in Thomas Jefferson's [Memorandum Books of 1776](_URL_17_) which listed a lot of his expenses. Among the items are two purchases of tea, three purchases of milk, and a purchase of coffee and a \"coffee mill\". Similar is the record of the estate of of Daniel Parke Custis, who died in 1756-57. Among the [\"slaves and personal property\"](_URL_7_) he left behind were tea pots, tea kettles, tea chests, coffee pots, milk pots, and water pots.Other than that, other non-alcoholic drinks available to the colonists would have been lemonade and possibly limeade (limes were bought in [juice form](_URL_16_) anyway), though probably not as frequently consumed by adults as alcohol, tea, coffee, and water. Lemons and limes were two fruits that were regularly available in the Thirteen Colonies, direct from the Caribbean colonies. These fruits appeared in many different [alcoholic drinks](_URL_22_) of the time, and also in its non-alcoholic lemonade form. The drink appears in Thomas Jefferson's memorandum books of both [1785](_URL_2_) and [1786](_URL_18_), and Abigail Adams [wrote about](_URL_3_) lemonade as well. In the same sentence in the same letter, Adams also [wrote about](_URL_3_) a more forgotten beverage that she spelled \"orgee\". This was probably \"orgeat\", a \"cold beverage made of barley, almonds, or orange-flower water\" according to the Oxford English Dictionary.Aside from that, there are also references to cocoa and vegetable juices in the papers of the Founding Fathers. There were probably some non-alcoholic apple, pear, and cherry ciders produced as well, particularly among the Quakers in Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey.In short, the Founding Fathers essentially drank all the same stuff we do today, except for fizzy soft drinks and artificially flavored drinks that came in the 19th Century and after. They didn't have access to all the varieties of fruit juices that we have today, but they did have access to some, and tea, coffee, milk, water, and lemonade, as well as various alcoholic beverages, would have been familiar to Americans at the time the country was founded.After the late 1700s, I am sure other beverages arose in the U.S. before carbonated soft drinks came around. Maybe somebody else can add more info about that period.FURTHER READING:\"History of Coffee In Old New York\", [*All About Coffee*](_URL_5_) by William Harrison Ukers, 1922[*Tea Drinking in 18th Century America: Its Etiquette and Equipage*](_URL_15_) by Rodris Roth, 1961[*Food and Drink In America: A History*](_URL_0_) by Richard James Hooker, 1981[*Abigail Adams: An American Heroine*](_URL_23_) by John P.

In it, he relates the history of rhinoplasty and other nasal surgery quite extensively. Nasal reconstructive surgery was actually one of the earlier aesthetic surgeries available, as one of the unfortunate symptoms of untreated syphilis is the deterioration of the nose (you can Google it if you like - it's pretty gruesome). Since at least the 17th century, people have been trying to repair this deformity, at first usually through the insertion of a replacement nasal bridge made of gold or some other durable material. Another thing they tried was the grafting of a flap of forehead or other skin over the damaged nose in order to try to hide it. Keep in mind that all these surgeries happened without modern sanitation and anesthesia. These surgeries got more and more elaborate and sophisticated, especially as the nineteenth century turned into the twentieth, and it became important not just to repair the nose, but to repair it in such a way that an observer could not tell that it was a specifically *syphilitic* nose that had been repaired. Of course, what you're asking about isn't really reconstruction of a diseased nose: it's a purely aesthetic attempt to re-shape the nose. Given the nineteenth century European obsession with race and racial hierarchy, this was also a going concern. Being able to \"pass\" as a \"superior\" race was a big deal - for an Irishman to pass as Anglo, for example, could spur his elevation into a higher social and economic class. By the turn of the twentieth century, medical technology was sophisticated enough to render these procedures relatively safe, and they became more common. John Orlando Roe, a surgeon from Rochester, NY, became well known for his operation to cure what at the time was called the \"pug nose,\" for example.So in essence, yes, plastic surgery was available during the early twentieth century to \"correct\" perceived nasal defects. One final note: Gilman says that even as the procedures became safer and more able to replicate \"natural\" noses, the visibility of a scar was still a source of stigma.

First a minor point of clarification: the term \"troll\" can mean many things depending on the location in Scandinavia. I think it is safe to assume that you are referring to the array of supernatural beings that figure in popular fantasy literature and films and that the trolls you are asking about are the big ogre-like monsters.One of the reasons why this is a difficult question to handle is that cultures nearly universally emerge from prehistory with beliefs and stories dealing with a full array of supernatural beings. Finding a point or origin in a prehistoric past is nearly impossible and can only be a matter of speculation.The focus of what is certainly the subject of your enquiry is the pre-industrial inheritance of Northern Europe. Medieval Norse literature frequently mentions these sorts of supernatural beings. It is not clear if these entities are identical to what nineteenth-century folklore collectors encountered, but there is enough continuity to suggest that they are either the same or there was cultural drift that at least links the supernatural beings expressed in literature and oral tradition in the two periods. Some of the difference may also be the result of different forms of expression: medieval literate writers as opposed to illiterate nineteenth-century storytellers.One the peculiar things about a certain type of supernatural beings is that regardless of the term used, they seem to hang together with a great deal of continuity. These are the elves (but we can also refer to them as fairies, sidhe, huldrefolk, or in parts of Scandinavia they are also called trolls). These entities are distinct in the way they are believed to live in communities with societies that roughly reflect the human condition. Outside of Britain, Ireland, Brittany, and Scandinavia (with some bleeding over into continental Europe and Russia), this idea is virtually non-existent. Supernatural beings playing the same part in similar legends are usually singular, or appear in pairs or threes - but they act singularly. It is reasonable to ask how this concept existed across linguistic lines in a well-defined geographic zone. If the idea diffused, why did it not diffuse elsewhere? Most folklorists would shun the explanation of diffusion because this perception of elves seems to be such a core perception of the supernatural world that it would be difficult for it diffuse: when it comes to folklore, stories travel easily, but they usually adapt to local belief systems rather than carry foreign belief systems with them.So by way of not answering your question, we can describe this peculiar aspect of oral tradition related to elves, but we cannot say with authority were it originated. The question of origin for all the supernatural beings at the heart of your question is in a remote past that is difficult to describe or understand.For sources: on trolls, a great piece of work is Elisabeth Hartmann, Die Trollvorstellungen in den Sagen und M\u00e4rchen der Skandinavischen V\u00f6lker (T\u00fcbingen: Eberhard Karls Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen, 1936).

I'll break them down before giving you some broad provisional answers.\"...less rich\" is the first one to be tackled.  The biggest problem here is what we mean by \"rich.\"  Do you mean the numbers of super rich within each half (in which case the west has FAR more great aristocrats than the east)?  Do you mean the median income (in which case the far urbanized and more middle class friendly east is greater)?  Do you mean in productive capacity (in which case it is actually the southern Mediterranean which was more important than east or west)?  Lest you think this be an irrelevant exercise, we face the same problem RIGHT NOW when we attempt to conceptualize how \"wealthy\" America is compared to other countries in the world.  In terms of GDP and the number of super rich individuals who reside here, we're at the top.  But in terms of median income, many other countries do better.  \"...less ...developed\" is the second problem.  What is your metric for development?  Urbanization (once again, the east is bigger here in terms of number of communities, but the west is arguably larger with the presence of the mega-city Rome)?  Engineering and manufacturing works (here, we could argue both halves are equal, consider evidence of the great mills in southern gaul, the pottery factories in north africa, aqueducts everywhere)?\"Always\" is the other problem.  The problems I've just laid out with respect to defining wealth and development are still present even as you try to hash out an era to compare it with.  The pre-Julius Caesar Gaul was apparently dotted with pre-existing populated settlements with significant trade links to the Roman state.  After conquest, they were integrated fairly quickly, and Gaul was where some of the most wealthy Roman aristocrats owned lands well into the late empire.  Arguably some of these aristocrats are the ones who made the transition from Roman to Merovingian after the empire's collapse.I mean, I don't want to get into too long of a ramble here because the question you're asking is flawed to begin with, so it's hard to address directly without cleaning up some of its underlying positions.  **Basically, your presumptions are too flawed to be answerable in any meaningful way.  The equivalent would be like asking, \"why are asians less developed and rich compared to europeans?\"**  There are so many problems with that statement, that it becomes unanswerable.But rather than leave you with an unsatisfying response of an unanswered \"it's complicated,\" I'll just say:tl;dr - There are many ways to conceive of the western regions as NOT less developed and rich than the east.  I do not outright say that the west was less developed than the east (or the opposite) because we have not agreed upon the terms of what development or rich means.  However (although I haven't expanded upon it here because it too also requires extensive elaboration), it is also clear that development and wealth changed quite a bit in the west in the time frame of the Roman Empire.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The western regions of the Roman Empire were always less developed and rich in comparison to the eastern ones.

Legionnaires, armed with Lorica Segmentata, Gladius, Scutum and etc, (The latter two simply mean sword and shield in Latin, but have become associated with the specific arms in the modern age) but I'm going to range a bit more and even move into the Byzantine period, because it may be helpful to talk a bit about the development of the Roman army and its style of warfare in answering this question.Real Answer Time: While the Roman army was famously adaptable, and used many different sorts of weaponry, I have come across no mentions of any sort of focused attempts to improve the quality of equipment in the sort of way you might see with military R & D in the modern age. While the equipment, techniques and tactics of the Roman military evolved over the years, the changes were more like the natural phenomenon of evolution than focused R & D. They absorbed tactics, utilized new equipment as it was developed or encountered and changed their methods as old ones were found inadequate to new situations, but when there were focused attempts to reform the army, (The Marian Reforms, for example) they were generally the efforts of one or a few men over a short period of time, rather than the sort of consistent, self-sustaining effort we see in modern science. To illustrate this, I'll give a few examples of some of the changes the army underwent in its 1000+ years of operation.The earliest accounts of the Roman army have them fighting in the Greek style, with levied hoplites as the main power of the army. While accounts are inconsistent as to precisely when, or against who (Possibly either the Gauls or the Samnites) the Romans made the change to the Manipular system, but the consensus is that it was for tactical reasons. The Greek style phalanx, while excellent from the front on flat ground, was serving them poorly in the hilly terrain of Italy against enemies who had no intention of fighting like Greeks themselves, and were happy to exploit that terrain to break up the Phalanx. (The Romans themselves would use similar methods when fighting the Macedonians years later) The maniple was adopted in response to tactical failings, but it would then go more or less unchanged for a further two centuries, until the Marian reforms.Jumping forward to the famed Legion of Cohorts, while it was an adaptable force, post-Marius there doesn\u2019t seem to have been a conscious effort to push it forward in terms of equipment. If you look, for instance, at the legionaries depicted in Trajan\u2019s column, they don\u2019t seem to differ much from the forces deployed in the campaigns of Julius Ceaser, a century and a half earlier. One thing that would have changed is an ever growing use and importance of non-roman troops both as Auxiliaries and in later periods in the Legions proper. This contributed to a further decentralization in fighting style, as many non-romans would continue to fight in the style of their people, rather than adopting the methods of the legion. This, in fact, made them quite valuable for plugging holes in the roman fighting style. Much of the Roman skirmishing force and cavalry was auxiliary in this period, though they did also serve as heavy infantry. Many of the changes in equipment and fighting style in the later roman period were not necessarily improvements, and certainly weren\u2019t the result of centralized study. Rather, they were a response to the changing fortunes of the empire, which no longer had the money, political stability and manpower to support the legions of old in the numbers necessary to hold back the enemies of Rome.  We see a shift to scale and lamellar armor in this period, away from plate, not because it was more protective (it probably wasn\u2019t) but because it was cheaper and easier to produce and maintain, making it more attractive to roman coffers drained by financial collapse, inflation/debasement, and raiding. (Some have argued that only frontline soldiers would have heavy armor at all, though this is most likely no more than situationally true.) Also, longer swords like the Spatha tend to replace shorter Gladii, again, not because they were better (Evaluating swords even today is messy business, and the question \u201cIs this a better sword?\u201d is generally best met with the reply \u201cBetter for what?\u201d) but because they were more in the style of the Germanic soldiers that began to fill the Empire\u2019s ranks as plagues and warfare drained traditional supplies of manpower.Shifting even later, the Byzantine Army underwent many changes in its time, again, as a response to the changing fortunes and enemies of the empire. They adopted horse arches, and many of the tactics of the steppe forces that were so successful against Rome\u2019s heavier legions. They avoided the pitched battles that were so common in Roman times, because their smaller, poorer and more heavily beset empire could not afford to wager armies in pitched battles the way the Empire could in the 1st or 2nd Centuries. Always, though, these changes were not as a result of the conscious study or development that we conceive of when we speak of modern military science. Rather, it was an amorphous, naturally occurring progression, composed of individual reforms, gradual changes and adaptation in the face of changing enemies and changing fortunes. Lendon, J. E.

Its meant to bolster many of these practices as well as serve as a defense against some of them. Germany, for example, has comparatively strict provisions on naming of children as well as a comparatively high threshold to actually change a name. For the latter, the German state requires a pertinent justification such as significant change in identity like marriage or a sex change or concerns for personal security but you can't change your name willy-nilly. In such cases, the right to name can be used to bolster a claim for necessity to change a registered and given name.In case of provisions mandating names, the right to a name can also be used either as a defense from discriminatory state practices \u2013 the Child's Right International Network [mentions countries with discriminatory naming practices like a federal state in India or Morroco](_URL_0_) \u2013 or in cases where a state needs to bolster their refusal of certain names. New Zealand e.g. was [reported to have rejected names like 4Real for children](_URL_1_). In these cases, the right to name serves to establish a practice of giving children names that will not cause them problems. Germany too, for example, has strict requirements for naming practices in that a child's sex needs to be recognizable from its name and that certain names can not be given to children when it is expected that they will cause them problems in life, such as \"Satan\" or \"Hitler\" as first names.Historically speaking, the motivation to enshrine this right in the convention does not come so much from cultures that refuse to give their children names but from examples where the state refused to register the names of children. Sharon Detrick in her legal commentary on the Convention mentions two historical practices: One is the refusal of the Nazi state to register children born in Concentration Camps (few there were) under names, instead only registering them in the prisoner's list as numbers. They are found in e.g. the prisoner registry of the Auschwitz Concentration Camp only as the numbers assigned to them by the camp administration (mostly under the \"B\" numbers since what few children were born there came from the Hungarian Jews deported there in 1944). They are seen as being not only deprived of their lives but also the means to properly commemorate them.A more widespread practice that figured heavily into this provision was how many a state dealt with stateless persons in the inter-war period in Europe and beyond. Statelessness remains a big problem (hence also the UNHCR convention to end statelessness) but was a huge problem in the inter-war period and also after WWII with millions of people being deprived from the protection that usually comes from being a citizen of a country. Detrick mentions cases such as inter-war France and Vichy France registering children born stateless not with their given names by their parents but merely as numbers in the pertinent registries. This is seen as depriving people of their identity and any potential ability to exercise what rights they have vis a vis any authorities. This also contributed to the right to a name enshrined in this convention.The aforementioned Child's Right International Network also mentions that often not giving children a name and not registering them is a huge contributing factor to child and human trafficking often tied to modern iterations of slavery but this is too far out of my field and expertise as well as would probably violate the 20-year rule.", "label": 0}, {"content": "Article 7 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child declares that a child has the right to a name at birth.

In addition, saloons were one of the first businesses to open in a frontier town, but they also opened and closed throughout the history of that town, so there could be a great deal of difference between that first establishment and a business that opened ten or fifteen years later.J. Ross Browne in his \"A Peep at Washoe\" describes merchants with just enough kegs of beer and bottles of whiskey to open a saloon in 1860 arriving in the newly-established Virginia City (then of Utah Territory; after 1861, Nevada Territory). The key to these first arrivals was first of all to arrive with the goods (which sounds obvious, but it was no easy accomplishment with poor roads, etc.). They would set up a tent and a blank of wood on two barrels and start selling their wares. The life of the saloon might be no longer than the time it took to sell everything that merchant brought. Restocking might entail his returning to his place of origin (in this case Sacramento of San Francisco would be likely) to obtain more goods and then to return to set up his saloon again. Or he might make an arrangement with a packer and then later with a teamster to bring in more product, and he could, then, sustain his saloon past the point of the exhaustion of his first inventory. Both scenarios occurred.For the opening of saloons later in the life of a frontier town, it would be possible for an entrepreneur to rely on well-traveled and established trade routes. Goods flowed into frontier towns from throughout the world, so it would be a matter of what the saloonkeeper wanted to sell as he (or she!) decided on ways to make his business different from others. One thing a saloonkeeper might do is to establish a contractual relationship with a brewery so the saloon could offer beer on tap (as opposed to bottled only). Saloons offering fresh beer in this way frequently marketed themselves as \"saloon and brewery\", which did not mean they were like modern brew pubs, but rather that they had an arrangement with a nearby brewery (which might serve any number of other unrelated saloons).Briefly, to answer the question of /u/Chernozem, financing of that first-on-the-scene saloon could take very little in up-front money. It could represent someone's own life savings that he hoped to amplify with outrageous charges being the first on the scene, or it could be a number of people throwing together the funds needed to accomplish this. In all likelihood it would not be a formal bank loan. Later, banks frequently loaned the money needed to purchase a building and set up a business. Our research in Virginia City indicates that many saloons lasted only 3 to 6 months, so it wasn't uncommon for a saloonkeeper to sell his business at least figuratively \"lock, stock, and barrel\" to the highest bidder, who might use a loan to purchase and then hope he could make more of a success of the location and stock than his predecessor had.A good source for all this is Kelly Dixon's \"Boomtown Saloons.\" Kelly excavated two of the four saloon we excavated in Virginia City.

It was reinforced by the Treaty of Windsor in 1386, which constituted a pact of mutual aid that was sealed by the marriage between John I of Portugal and Philippa of Lancaster (Edward III's granddaughter). The alliance established by the treaty of 1373 is the oldest still active alliance in the world. The pact of mutual aid has been activated many times in the centuries since. Most notably, Britain came to the aid of Portugal against a Franco-Spanish invasion in 1762 during the Seven Years War and again against the French during the Napoleonic Wars (an invasion that occurred because Portugal, alone of all the nations of continental Europe, refused to cease trading with Britain, in defiance of Napoleon's Continental System). This actually constituted Britain's largest terrestrial commitment for the duration of the conflict. Portuguese troops fought alongside the Allies on the Western Front in WW1. Interestingly, in WWII Britain negotiated with Portugal *not* to activate the alliance. For Britain, Portuguese neutrality was essential in helping to keep Spain from joining the Axis powers.  The official statement of the Portuguese government was that the alliance was intact but Britain had chosen not to activate the pact of mutual aid.

With him came a giant military force of men, battleships and submarines and was always accompanied by a police escort. Mussolini was furious when Sicily's Mafioso mayor Don Francesco Cuccia whispered to him \"You are with me, you are under my protection. What do you need all these cops for?\". This blatant undermining of Mussolini's power really, really pissed him off. The visit was quickly ended. This event demonstrated to Mussolini not only how little he was respected by the Mafia, but also how powerful it was in the area. Any dictator worth his salt would want this behaviour eradicated. Generally, this trip to Sicily is considered the beginning of Mussolini's war on the Mafia.During the 1920s the Mafia's power was slowly declining. A large contributor to this was the complete prohibition of alcohol in America in 1920, which had brought so much business that many members moved to the States to start a new branch of the Italian Mafia there. Nevertheless, the Mafia was still in control of the island: most elections were rigged, most politicians were either members of the Mafia or affiliated with it in some way. To put a stop to this, Mussolini appointed Cesare Mori, nicknamed 'The Iron Prefect' for his relentless war against the Mafia. He had been working in Sicily since 1903, and served there during the Great War. During this period, around 40 thousand Sicilians evaded the draft which caused a massive increase of crime in the area. Here Mori first encountered the Mafia and gained experience in fighting it. Even though Mori stated that he didn't support Mussolini and his blackshirts at first, once Mussolini came to power Mori came to accept and even support the regime. This, along with his experience in the area, made him a perfect candidate.After being appointed the prefect of Palermo in 1925, Mori quickly started arresting several high-profile members of the Mafia. Within two months he arrested over 500 men, within four years: 11 thousand. He basically had free reign: Mussolini told him \"You have carte blanche. The authority of the state must absolutely be re-established in Sicily. If the laws still in force hinder you, this will be no problem. We will draw up new laws.\" Mori's plan was to \"out-Mafia\" the Mafia: he had to show that the state was the toughest gang and that the people no longer needed the Mafia for protection. He essentially led a gang war, except this one was supported by a utra-militeristic government.One of Mori's most successful acts was his siege of Gangi in 1926. Gangi was (still is actually) a province that was the hub of criminal activity in Sicily. During the ten-day-long siege, the province was littered with armed policemen, roadblocks and armoured cars. This military force, combined with the freezing January weather kept the Mafiosi at home while the police cut all communications (telephone and telegraph wires) to the outside world and went house to house, searching for criminals. The police was acting above the law: suspects' cattle was slain, families were taken hostage and women got raped left and right. Some interesting interrogation methods included forcing people to drink castor oil or to eat live frogs.On the tenth day, Mori arrived to Gangi himself as a 'liberator'. He had brought with him the full set: bands, banners all over the place, the classic balcony speech and even congratulations from the Duce himself. \"Fascism has cured Italy of many of it's wounds. It will cauterise the sore of crime in Sicily - with a red hot iron if need be!\" he wrote. Mori's final count after the ten days was 130 Mafiosi and 300 accomplices arrested. Mori repeated this siege tactic on other crime hubs with great success.Another important tactic Mori had were show trials and public rallies against the Mafia. It was common for prisoners to not have the opportunity to defend themselves, especially if they were (or were suspected to be) a high-level member of the Mafia. These trials almost always led to convictions, which created fear of the state around the island. This led to more reports and accusations given to the police, which made Mori's hunt for criminals much easier.In 1929, Mori was called back to Rome. The Mafia was declared to be defeated, news that was used a lot in propaganda (look up some posters, they're great). Murder and other crime rates were down significantly. At this point, 11 thousand people had been arrested. Many of these were likely innocent, but with virtually unlimited power and only one job, Mori made sure he stomped out all the criminals he could with little regard for innocents.Even though the Mafia was still there, it's power was nothing in comparison to what they were a decade earlier. As an ex-journalist, Mussolini knew the power of mass media and made sure that Sicilian crime was rarely reported. Majority of the Mafiosi fled to America, both to run away from Mussolini and to join the quickly growing Italian Mafia in America, centred mostly in New York. This branch eventually split up into the Five Families, which are still operating today.Further Reading:* Cockayne, James. Hidden Power the Strategic Logic of Organized Crime.

Leading up to the 1908 Election, Taft was favored considerably by the incumbent Theodore Roosevelt. The two had been friends for years and were extremely close. Taft had served as Secretary of War during TR's second term, and would act as the unofficial acting-president when the president was out of town. Unfortunately, the public wasn't all that too enthused about Taft. Theodore Roosevelt was beloved by many. He was the first president that actively sought media attention. He used his ability to creat, and influence news to achieve his policy goals. Taft, while popular , did not attract the same adoration.Reinforcing the \"poor replacement\" belief about Taft, cartoonists depicted the obese Taft as being squeezed into Theodore Roosevelt costumes.[Here](_URL_0_), you can see Uncle Sam skeptically looking at Taft dressed as a member of the Rough Riders (the cavalry regiment Roosevelt had founded during the Spanish-American War). Since newspapers were joking about his weight, it's probable that it was a subject the public thought about as well.Taft is an interesting figure in US political history, as he's probably the only President who didn't *really* want to be president. Taft was an insanely talented person, but wasn't very strong willed. He served as a lawyer, then Judge in his early career. He excelled as both. His talent attracted a lot of attention by those within the Republican Party, and it wasn't long before he found his way to Washington DC. But Taft wasn't happy in government. Being a judge was his passion in life, and had hoped to serve on the Supreme Court some day. Due to consistent pressure by those around him, primarily his wife and his Mother, he relented and left his judicial appointment for government. Unfortunately, Taft went on to be a poor President, especially in the opinion of former President Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt was so dissatisfied with Taft's performance as president that he ran as an intentional spoiler candidate in the 1912 election to limit Taft to one term. Taft would then go on serve as Chief Supreme Court Justice, a job he was both better at, and enjoyed more.

In 1921 General Dawes established the Permanent Conference on Printing and they adopted 8x10.5 standard for government printing.  We don't know why this was chosen specifically since there are no records explaining why the decision was made.  At the same time the Committee on the Simplification of Paper Sizes was working with the Bureau of Standards as part of President Hoover's Elimination of Waste in Industry policies.  They were more representative of commercial paper usage, and recommended a standard format of 8.5x11, also in an attempt to decrease costs and reduce inventory requirements.  These two groups learned about each other in the early 20s, but couldn't agree on which format to adopt.Also in the early 1920s, Germany began standardizing paper sizes through the German Institute for Standardization (*Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung* or DIN) and adopted the A-series of paper sizes, the most popular being the A4 (210mm x 297mm or 8.27x11.7).  The A-series was based on a width/length ratio of 1:1.414, or 1:\u221a2, which allows it to be halved without changing its proportions. Eventually other European nations began adopting the German standards and after the Second World War the International Organization of Standardization (ISO) also accepted the German standards for its paper format standardization policy.  By the 1960s, most countries had adopted these standards making A4 paper the \"standard\" letter size paper we know today. In the 1980s President Reagan standardized government paper to 8.5x11 but for the life of me I can't find out why... Only references to Reagan doing this, but unfortunately I don't have the resources to look into it further.  The United States (probably because they don't use the metric system?) and Canada (commercial links to the US maybe?) still use letter size, legal size, etc., while most other nations use A-series, B-series, etc.The first instance of \"paper standardization\" was recognized in 1961 by the International Congress of Historians of the Paper Industry in Holland as a the Bologna statute of 1398.  A marble tablet was placed in Bologna that read \"These are the sizes of the molds of the community of Bologna corresponding to the sizes of paper noted which must be manufactured in Bologna and district, and are indicated here below.\"  The sizes were *recute*(315mm x 450 mm), *mecane*(345mm x 515mm), *realle*(445mm x 615mm), and *imperialle*(500mm x 740mm).[Below /u/MomentOfArt has provided some details on the Reagan decision.](_URL_0_)", "label": 0}, {"content": "The standard letter size paper is 8.5 x 11 inches.

I have no knowledge what schools, books, or teachers say for students beneath college level.  Fortunately, since the American Revolution is something studied globally, I\u2019ve studied historiographical debates of modern and previous historians in Britain, and I will be happy to discuss that here.Overall, the majority of historians who studied and reported on the American Revolution currently have no major conflicts with American historians who study the same time period, but this is not true for all of the last two centuries.  The first person to tackle this question was British historian Richard Middleton, who conducted research and wrote about it in his article, [\u201cBritish Historians and the American Revolution\u201d](_URL_1_) . His article mainly seeks to study what early British historians said and reported on the American Revolution.  I feel obligated to point out that in these early days of the discipline of academic history scholarship, being objective was not something that was desired.  Early historians, generally speaking had very little problem with letting their biases show.  This drastically changed during the middle of the 20th century, as historians sought to become more objective in their study and reporting of history.  It\u2019s also worth noting that the vast majority of British scholarship in the first century and a half after the American Revolution took place was mainly focused on British perspectives; such as British politics and economics during that period.  Americans, especially during the 19th century conducted a lot of history related to the biographies of the \"Founding Fathers\" and also many sub-topics within the war itself (like military history of the Continental Army). Far fewer British historians studied American perspectives on the war, such as the Continental Congress, the Founding Fathers, or the Contiental Army. Middleton noted that many British historians were British apologists, who did side more favorably with the British Crown's decisions during the war and were very critical of the rebelling colonists.  This article does a few interesting things, first it accounts for a history of early British Historians who studied the American Revolution and notes that some of the early historians from the late 18th century were in fact more favorable in their views of the rebelling colonists, but they were the minority.  Historians tended to be torn between two radical positions in the U.K. One historian, Sir George Otto Trevelyan created a three-volumne account of the American Revolutionary War between 1874 and 1880.  Trevelyan, a liberal, reported that the first twenty years of King George III\u2019s reign was a period of regression for English laws and and rights.  His writing reflects that the Americans were justified in overthrowing the British government, calling the Americans \u201claw respecting people, who did not care to encroach on the privileges of others and liked still less to have their own rights invaded.\u2019 [Middleton, 50].  This created one of the first historiographical debates in this particular field, with other men, like William Massey and William Lecky arguing for the traditional \u201cTory\u201d view of the war.  Where Trevelyan came down hard on royal governors and British officials in America, historians like Lecky was much more gentle on them, saying that they were just loyal men trying to fulfil their duties to the King. [Middleton 51]. Ultimtely, Middleton noted a few key differences between these earlier types of scholarship between American and British scholarship on the war: >  From this study of British historians and the American Revolution, one or ore general conclusions can be drawn. In the first place, there has bee na curious dichotomy between scholars on both sides of the Atlantic as to what actually constituted the Revolution. Most British writers do not appear to consider it to be properly underway until the fateful year of 1775, while for most American writers, it was then merely a matter of dotting the \u2018i\u2019s\u2019 and crossing the \u2018t\u2019s\u2019 on the declaration of independence [sic].  There has also been little attempt to understand the revolt of the thirteen colonies by analysis of their social, economic, or politiocal development, lines of approach for so long popular with the American historians. [Middleton,  58]Historians during the 20th century, especially in the post World War II era appeared to settle more soundly into the more objective approach to history.  Middleton spoke also of, at the time of the publication of that article in 1971, how there was a revival of the British study of the American Revolution during his present because of the infusion of American culture, history, and politics that exploded in those preceding decades. [Middleton, 56]In recent history, the vast majority of historical scholarship that has come out (at least as what I\u2019ve seen and studied] has not conflicted with the current consensus of scholarship  coming out of the United States.  Some British historians, like Stanley Weintraub\u2019s *Iron Tears* has [pointed out some differences that he sees in views of the American Revolution](_URL_0_), but nothing really seems too far out that it would conflict with what other historians would say.  For instance, he shows that from the British perspective, the \u201ctaxation without representation\u201d rallying cry of the colonists was a bit weak of an argument from the British perspective because many of the Englishmen living in England were not represented in Parliament either.  (His book though more-so focuses on how the Average person in Britain felt about the war, rather than focusing on Historians studying that period).Overall, modern scholarship between historians of the United States and Britain tends to add to the historical conversation in general on this topic, rather than causing conflict between them.  Historians will disagree in every field, it's why consensus does not have the same power as a fact, but there isn't anything fundamentally different between scholarship coming out of the U.K. versus what is coming out of the United States or other countries.

In Rome, probably the closest we have are plebs - non-noble citizens, who would have ranged from wealthy to poor (and experienced different qualities of life), and we would be talking about both urban and rural peoples. In Anglo-Saxon England (and the situation would have been different in Wales, Scotland and Ireland), society was broken between peasant churls and nobility of various ranks, from thane to alderman. Peasant life would have differed between urban and rural (the majority living in rural). And both societies had slaves in large numbers, and fifty percent of the population - the women - experienced life differently, with usually far more limitations on their freedoms than their brothers, fathers and sons. The next issue is geographic scope and societal differences. Rome in 500 BC was a city state, one of many in Italy/the Mediterranean, and its early days are cloaked in myth (Rome only became a republic around 500 BC). The question might be easier to answer if moved forward a few centuries, into the heyday of the republic or during the empire. Rome, for much of its history, was a city state, so you're talking about people within a narrow geographic area. Britain in 1000 AD was split between England, Scotland, and smaller territories in Ireland and Wales, and the experiences of 'commoners' varied from state to state. Life was structured differently to Rome: where Rome was mainly urban, England was mainly agrarian. Where Roman life was defined by your relationship to the city (whether you were a citizen or not, what duties you owed the state and what the state owed to you), Churls had a relationship to the land and their landowners.Life was so very different between the two places that it is difficult to compare if one was 'better' than the other, and is probably unanswerable. I can guess that most of us today would consider the urban Roman life preferable, because it is in some ways more relatable to us than medieval British life, but that doesn't mean it is 'better'. You will also struggle to find someone who knows both Roman and British history well enough to provide a meaningful answer covering both halves of the question.But there are two really interesting questions here: what was life life in the early Roman republic, especially for non-nobles? What was life like for peasants in the British isles in 1000 AD?If you don't get an answer here (and hopefully you do, lots of interest), perhaps you'll want to break the question in two, and you might get more luck that way.", "label": 0}, {"content": "In 500 BC, Rome was a great empire that ruled over much of the Mediterranean.

Not all WWII veterans had a disdain for Vietnam veterans, some of whom were their own sons.After returning to Vietnam, many veterans felt a detachment from their old reality and routines. Their families showed no interest nor understanding of their experiences in war and the men felt alienated by this lack of understanding. The natural reaction to this is to seek out those who had been in similar conditions and that would lead men to their colleagues but also to other veterans. Organizations such as *Veterans of Foreign Wars* and the *American Legion* were dominated by WWII veterans at the time and it was these sort of places were these newly arrived veterans turned to for support and sympathy.This was not always the case. Christian G. Appy, in his book *Working-Class* War argues that it was more than just a different kind of war that separated Vietnam veterans from WWII veterans. The Vietnam veterans were young men who naturally had very different opinions, views and interests than these older men and were, in the words of Appy, \"not especially eager to conform to the traditional ways of conservative organizations.\" The view of the war in the minds of WWII veterans certainly did not help the alienation some Vietnam veterans felt. The war had been lost by these men, a dark spot in the military record of the United States according to the WWII veterans. The Vietnam veterans felt and thought that the older veterans had a very low opinion of them - both as soldiers and human beings. Having to constantly hear about WWII veterans being in \"real wars\" and how their war had been nothing but a \"small skirmish\" that could have been over and done with had they just dropped a few atomic bombs did not create a healthy environment for Vietnam veterans.This sometimes even extended into ones personal life.

You didn't win your war.\" Todd's father, Appy goes on to write, did not even acknowledge the veteran status of his own son.

At all.Scholars have long recognized the twelfth century as a pivotal moment in the intellectual history of sodomy in the west (and of pretty much everything, to be fair). Although there are scattered references to \"sex as the sodomites do\"--which is to say, anal intercourse regardless of the sex/gender of people involved--as definitely a sin and a very bad thing in earlier medieval sources, it's really in the 12th century that theologians and the new specialty of canon lawyers make it a particular point of focus and bitter opprobrium.However, into the early 13th century, the primary target of this zeal was *clergy.* Accusations of heresy and sodomy went hand-in-hand in the Languedoc in the run-up to the Albigensian Crusade (against the people the Church deemed Cathars). Lateran III (Church council) in 1179 targeted clergy who violate clerical celibacy with either marriage *or* the \"sin against nature\" (sodomy, since anal intercourse can never lead to reproduction). Church councils in France in 1212 and 1214 also impressed the evils of sodomy among the clergy. The only time laymen were mentioned among these was in 1179, and even then, the recommendation was excommunication.But the 13th century was its own turning point in the intertwined history of religion and sexuality. The Church had quite successfully used control over marriage practices (such as through laws on consanguinity) as a spearhead in entrenching itself as a power player in profane society. At Lateran IV in 1215 and with the introduction of new orders of preachers (especially the Franciscans and Dominicans), the Church committed itself to shepherding workaday laity more closely through life and to salvation, including through religious instruction and moral discipline. The diffusion of actual *practice* out of the ideal, including the most important points of \"every Christian of both sexes\" must confess their sins once a year to their parish priest and then receive the Eucharist at Easter, took time to filter downwards. But pastoral theologians were *enormously* concerned with regulating sexual practices. Handbooks for confessors, arranged according to the seven deadly vices, devote vastly more space to sins under the umbrella of *luxuria* than the other six (although *ira*, wrath, gets a fair amount of play). And intriguingly, some of the *summa confessorum* authors had a particular emphasis on sodomy. Far from the times of Aelred of Rievaulx not even daring to mention the sin directly for fear of accidentally corrupting the mind of someone who'd never thought of non-PIV sex, Paul of Hungary's *summa* spends roughly **100 times** as much space on sodomy as on other sins of lust.But it's noteworthy that Paul is still an extreme example at this stage. And just like scholars assume annual participation in confession and the Eucharist was hardly universal immediately in 1215, actual attempts to control lay sexuality beyond basic issues involving marriage in both canon and civic courts were very slow in coming.Italy led the way. In 1250, Bologna decreed that the punishment for sodomy was exile, but the banished could petition for permission to return. In 1259, the city rescinded the possibility of forgiveness. Only in 1288 was sodomy declared a crime deserving execution. Contemporary German law codes were still ignoring sodomy as a crime. In France, meanwhile, sodomy was apparently a possible crime by 1270. However, there were no prosecutions, convictions, or executions until the reign of Philip V (1316-1322; note that I am not counting the Templars here, since the sodomy accusations there were sort of an \"...and the kitchen sink\" kind of deal), during which there was a whopping...one.England, meanwhile? England appears to have been the least concerned with sodomy as a whole. Not only was sodomy not on the law books in the 13th century, but even during the 15th and 16th centuries when convicted sodomites (mostly men, but a handful of women as well) were burned to death with some regularity in many countries (especially Italy)--executions in England for the sin against nature were surprisingly rare.We have *no* surviving peasant voices from the Middle Ages, so we cannot reconstruct the *fama* (or infamy, in this case) associated with sodomy in 13th century English villages. This makes it difficult to talk about potential social consequences on the daily life level.

They were Greenlandic Norse who had gone to Markland (America) for lumber for Greenland, as noted in the Icelandic Annals.It is commonly agreed that the Greenlanders continued to travel to America for lumber and fur, and probably to some extent trade with the natives. The Maine Penny, a Norwegian silver coin from the reign of King Olaf Kyrre (1067-1093) found in Maine might be evidence of trade between the Norse and the natives of America - however, the authencity of the find is heavily debated, with some stating that it is a clear forgery, while others simply say that the evidence in inconclusive.The end of the Medieval Warm Period and the plague disrupted the ability of the Norse Greenland colony to survive, while inuits spreading southwards started to compete with the Norse over space and fishing and hunting grounds.The plague killed 50-75% of the Norwegian population and ended all lack of land, as well as the Norwegian ability to have a ruling class that could compete for the throne, which became the prize of fighting Swedish and Danish Kings, with the Danes coming out on top.Thus, there were no royal power that could fit expeditions and form colonies like the Iberian powers and England did. The abundant supply of land after the plague in Norway meant that there were little to no incentive to emigrate and the failure of the Greenland colony meant that the stepping stone to America was lost.While the Norse on Greenland did travel to America several times, as their settlement died out and the plague hit Norway, the incentive to go to America was lost, and the Norwegians (and their Icelandic subjects) discountinued their journies.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Norse settlements in America were abandoned in the early 11th century.

In the 1850s, Wisconsin and Michigan \u2500 in particular Michigan's upper peninsula \u2500 were the Wild West of the United States. **These new states (Michigan in 1837 and Wisconsin in 1848) had the classic problems of the American frontier: little governance and endemic corruption.** One of the best introductory depictions of the timber piracy issue of the 1850s can be found in the third chapter of *Guardian of the Great Lakes: The U.S. Paddle Frigate Michigan*, which I've drawn upon for this answer.In the early years of the United States, the federal government passed laws that gave the U.S. Navy the authority over timber on public land. Timber was a critical natural resource, necessary for military defense and the construction of ships. At first, this authority stretched only to species like live oak and red cedar. The white pine common in the Great Lakes area was at first immune to this restriction, but [the U.S. Supreme Court decided in *U.S. v. Briggs* (1850)](_URL_0_) that federal ownership extended to white pine as well.In 1831, Congress had made the illegal cutting of timber a felony. Given that the vast majority of Wisconsin and Michigan consisted of federal property at this time, the 1850 U.S. Supreme Court decision meant almost anyone could be charged as a felon. Until the Homestead Act of 1862, the United States' policy of settlement was haphazard at best. There were immense benefits to cutting timber illegally. In the 1850s, there were no cross-Mississippi railroads. There were transportation options, however. The Chicago River canal and the Erie Canal before it allowed easy transportation from anywhere on the Great Lakes to tidewater. Bradley Rogers, author of *Guardian of the Great Lakes*, writes on pages 43-44:  > \"The cutting and sale of timber from federal land was an extremely profitable business and well worth the small risk of being caught. Penalties reached a maximum of a few hundred dollars in fines or legal fees. On the other hand, an average logging crew of 12 to 16 men in 1850 could make the extravagant sum of $4,000 for a winter's work.\"There were few federal agents on the ground to stop this illegal trade. In winter, timber cutters would roam the woods of Wisconsin and Michigan, cutting trees. Once the spring thaw arrived and the rivers melted, the resulting logs would be floated downriver to mills for processing. The lumber would be loaded onto barges or steamers and taken across the lakes to market. Many times, the winter lumberjack was the summer stevedore or jack tar. In 1851, the U.S. Department of the Interior took over the timberlands and tried to crack down where its predecessor, the Department of Treasury, had allowed the piracy to continue unabated. It had little luck, however. The area was geographically vast and its agents were few on the ground. In addition, the timber pirates had gotten rich from their industry, and they had the political and physical wherewithal to fight back.They put political pressure on the federal government, which found its law-enforcement arm in the area strapped for cash. Federal law allowed agents to seize and auction illegal timber, but the timber poachers rigged the auctions, buying it back at low prices. When agents started auctioning the timber in distant locations beyond the reach of the rigged auctions, the poachers switched tactics. They burned seized timber or stole it back from the federal authorities. They murdered federal agents, bribed judges and even held a version of the Boston Tea Party in Chicago, with timber in place of tea.What the federal agents needed was a seagoing presence as well as a land-based one. Unfortunately for them, there were only two federal boats available. One was a revenue cutter in poor shape, and the other was the *USS Michigan*, the U.S. Navy's first iron-hulled ship. In 1853, the Michigan departed Buffalo for Chicago to interdict the illegal trade. While crossing Lake Huron, the *Michigan* was rammed by the largest ship on the lakes, the paddle steamer *Buffalo*. While the *Michigan* didn't sink, it was damaged badly enough that it had to be laid up for two months for repairs. It is assumed \u2500 though never proven \u2500 that the crew of the *Buffalo* was acting on orders from the timber pirates and purposely rammed the *Michigan* in an attempt to sink it.While the *Michigan* didn't sink, it wasn't able to stop the illegal trade alone. Only the arrival of the American Civil War in 1860 slowed the illegal trade, and only the arrival of the railroads and reliable governance curtailed the poaching.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The timber pirates were a group of smugglers who sailed their boats into the Great Lakes region and snatched timber from the trees.

Modern soundbytes like the USA being a nation of immigrants or having an entrepreneurial spirits were actually a symptom instead of a cause of the financial opportunity available in the United States.After the Virginia colony failed to create a neo-aristocratic cash crop economy like that of the Caribbean islands, they transitioned to a new revenue scheme - the colony's administrators sold land to settlers either in exchange for money or for years of labor. This model later became widespread throughout many of the 13 colonies. The abundance of fertile land in North America spawned what economic historian David Carlton calls the \"American agricultural ladder\". Unlike in Europe, tenants in the United States could reasonably expect to save money to own their own farms by their late 20s and early 30s.This meant the United States, even at the time of the American Revolution, already had a higher GDP per capita than any European country. Its people on average were several inches taller than the average European since they could afford better nutrition. The abundance of land also created a culture of ownership - at one point in the early 1800s, over 80% of white males in America owned their own businesses, and the majority of those businesses owned the buildings and land they operated out of. At at time in the Western world where property was the primary indication of wealth, this represented a very good economic success rate for the average person.More importantly, ready abundance of land led to sever labor shortages in both cities and rural areas, which fuelled capital-intensive business models, innovation, and better returns per person. The United States was far from the only industrial giant by the early 20th century, but it was the only one by the 1930s to make widespread use of the assembly line and scientific management. Other nations with cheaper labor pools like Germany, the United Kingdom, and Japan made use of more labor intensive and quality-focused industrial methods, while the United States' factories were famed for their standardization and quantitative output. It was not just mechanical innovation that labor shortage combined with a ready availability of resources facilitated - commercial innovation occurred as well. The United States had some of the first truly integrated industries in the world, and a lot of modern management and business theory originated from American industrial groups during the age of tycoons. Industrial combination, consolidation, and monopolization were just another way to exploit the maximum number of resources with the minimum number of people.Labor shortage also expressed itself in rural economics - the United States among all major industrial powers had the highest average acreage per farmer, leading farmers to more readily mechanize their lands and to plant fewer labor-intensive crops and more capital intensive ones.These factors made the United States a very open labor market - it was much easier not to be \"trapped\" in a profession in the United States than in Europe. New immigrants could readily find work, and while they faced discrimination, labor was always needed. Culturally, this meant that traditional barriers (class, manners, education) to finding certain employment or succeeding in selling one's product were far less important in the United States than in Europe.Perhaps most importantly, workers in the United States had a far higher level of disposable and investable income than in Europe. By the early 20th century, wages in the United States were at least twice those of most other industrialized nations, while prices for basic goods were only marginally higher. Differences like this on an individual level matter. After covering subsistence needs, the rest of the money of a family goes either towards savings, investment, or acquiring increasingly complicated products. The last three needs are vital to developing a complex consumer market, and increasing generational wealth. For example, someone making $100 who spends all of it on food, bills, and necessities accumulates nothing, while, assuming a 4% rate of return, someone making $100 who invests $10 per year will end up with $13,000 by the end of a 50-year career.However, there are many caveats to this conclusion. The first and most obvious is race - opportunity was greatest for native-born whites, and the further you went from that profile, the lower upward mobility was. Second, wealth inequality in the United States was just as high, and in some cases even higher, than in most European countries. In spite of there being more opportunities and higher wages for the average person, much of the wealth in the United States until the 1930s was concentrated at the very top. This was due to the huge economies of scale advantages in a very capital-intensive market like the United States. As John Jacob Astor said, \"the first $100,000 was difficult... after that, it was very easy\". At one point, John D. Rockefeller alone owned 2% of the US economy. So, while spectacular rags to riches stories were possible, small riches to big riches stories were more common.Finally, we need to be careful about how we define class mobility. The American Dream was in some ways a reality - an industrious commoner had a better chance in the United States than in Europe of eventually owning his own property and leaving a sizable inheritance to his children, and immigrants to the United States could expect to make far more than they made in their home countries. This is a definition of economic mobility in **absolute** terms, in which case the United States definitely earned the title of the land of opportunity.However, some economists, especially in recent years, define economic mobility in **relative** terms, as in \"how likely am I to become richer than my neighbor whose father was a CEO?\". This has led some economics, most notably Seymour M. Lipset and Reinhard Bendix, to conclude that **economic mobility is the same in all industrialized countries** and **only affected by income inequality**. If you read into this argument, you soon realize it is very tautological. If we define economic and class mobility not as \"how likely am I to be richer than I was\", and more as \"how likely am I to be richer than *other* people\", then *obviously* mobility is the same in all countries with similar amounts of inequality. This has led to somewhat ridiculous conclusions like studies reporting low economic mobility in early 21st century China. In this case, the US in the late 19th century would not have fared any better than much of Europe. TLDR: Because of a ready availability of cheap land and resources, there was a chronic labor shortage in the US compared to Europe, which led to higher wages and levels of industrial innovation. This led to huge wage differences between the US and Europe which facilitated familial savings and investment, and the buildup of more generational wealth. Cultural explanations for mobility in the US, such as an \"entrepreneurial culture\" or \"no nobility\" were mostly by-products of the ready availability of work and entrepreneurial opportunities, and higher levels of investment, instead of the causes of mobility. However, while mobility was high*er* in the US, it was still a very unequal society until the 1930s. These 2 analyses put together mean that the average resident in the US could expect more of an increase in wealth at the end of his life than the beginning compared to the average European, but they had largely equal chances of ending up *ahead* of someone who was born into a rich family.Sources:Carlton, David.

Lets start out with the timeline [here](_URL_0_), the big events are the landing and the first walk. The walk was filmed, there was no live video of the landingYou can see the landing happened at 4:18 PM EDT and the first walk happened at 10:56 PM EDT, so you would think 'Hey, perfect time, people are getting off work to the news it landed and going to bed to the sight of Armstrong on the moon', but, look at one of the main events between the two 'Decision made to proceed with EVA prior to first rest period.' The flight plan had originally called for a 5 hour rest period that would have put the first walk around 4 am, which not many Americans might have been up.So why did they forgo the rest? According to Aldrin [here](_URL_1_),  > \"We had discussed, among ourselves, the possibility of evaluating, during this first 2 hours, whether we wanted to go on with the rest period (scheduled to begin at 104:50) or to proceed with the EVA preparation. I think we had concluded before the end of the simulated countdown that we would like to go ahead with the EVA and it was sometime in here that Neil called to ground and let them know that.\"and Armstrong from the same source > There were two factors that we thought might influence that decision. One was the spacecraft systems and any abnormalities that we might have that we'd want to work on; and the second was our adaptation to one-sixth g and whether we thought more time in one-sixth g before starting the EVA would be advantageous or disadvantageous at that point. Basically, my personal feeling was that the adaptation to one-sixth g was very rapid and was very pleasant, easy to work in, and I thought at the time that we were ready to go right ahead into the surface work and recommended that.So it appears, the timing just seemed to be lucky coincidence. Having worked at NASA in an internship and been really into the space program for my entire life, I will add  this, at NASA, safety is 100% paramount. There were plenty of opportunities for things to go wrong, for example, on Apollo 14, the Lunar Module encountered an error and essential had to orbit the moon several times before landing, delaying everything. If NASA or the crew decided they needed that rest after all, they would have taken it even if meant delaying the walk until 4 am.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Apollo 11 moon landing was on July 20th, 1969.

Due to the size and complexity of the answer required to fully explain this question, I would like to focus on the military aspect.By the time of Augustus, Roman expansion of territory exponentially decreased.  As a result, Roman troops and legions became increasingly tied to the frontier areas.  By the 2nd century A.D., temporary frontier forts built by the legions to provide shelter in winter became permanent settlements representative of small cities.  As a result, troops became increasingly bound to one particular region of the empire.  By the 4th century A.D., new reforms took place trying to resolve this problem, splitting the army into 2 major segments, the limitanei and a strategic reserve called the comitantenses. The limitnanei\u2019s main job was protecting the frontier borders from minor raids by barbarians, who numbered only a few hundred in most instances.  Unlike the limitanei, the comintansenses were designated as the mobile reserve, and designated to move to any threatened area and remove the danger.  Unfortunately, the most important part of this reform, the comitansenses, failed in many respects, mainly the comitansenses also became tied to a certain region or province, negating the purpose it was created.  Having the Roman troops isolated and tied to specific areas in the empire caused great harm in many respects like civil war.Roman troop\u2019s identity became connected to the local regions and its commanders.  When one emperor died or was seen as illegitimate, a commander with a significant army could declare himself emperor.  In other instances, the local military forces themselves would declare a new emperor.  This caused huge succession problems and led to an extremely dangerous pattern of civil war.  One saw many examples of this in the 3rd and 4rth century, the most famous example being Constantine whose Gaul based army militarily defeated the armies of the East in order to proclaim him emperor.  The civil wars played a huge part in weakening the Roman military, making it less effective in defending the empire from outside invasions.  Economic distress, changes, and population decrease also weakened the Roman military.  For a large part of their history, the legions built and supplied their own weaponry and armor from military foundries. Essentially, if there was a need for equipment, the legion could supply that need themselves.  They were effectively self-sufficient.  By the late Roman Empire, weapons and armor manufacturing had been given to nearby cities and professionals who built the equipment and supplied the local Roman troops.  This could be a huge liability especially when disease, war, or political corruption was in play.  Consequently, local Roman troops could suffer from lack of supplies not representative of the legions from older eras.  Local political corruption is key here and leads me to my next point, the actual size of the Roman army and its potential for being a paper tiger.  It is important to preface this and further arguments with the fact that the late Roman Empire\u2019s military was still the most effective, disciplined, and best equipped forces in the Western World, yet it is also important to note several weaknesses that had developed, for instance, its actual size compared to its paper size.  Some scholars estimate the Late Roman Empire fielded close to 700,000 troops! This number is nearly twice the size of the Augustus era troop level of around 400,000.  However, many of these troop numbers were most certainly faked.  It was common to see a legion on paper fielding thousands of men, but in reality, its real numbers were much smaller.  One reason for this was the army\u2019s behavior at the time.  Due to the need for field mobile armies to fight off multiple threats on the borders, quick reaction forces would be scratched together from multiple frontier garrisons and reserves.  These forces were called vexillations.  Eventually over time, these vexillations became defacto  legions.  As a result, one saw a drastic explosion in the number of legions, but saw little quantitative increase in manpower.  Essentially, the legions split into even smaller legions.  Another reason for inaccurate troop numbers was political corruption.  This cannot be emphasized enough.  In order to receive more money for their coffers, local officials would inflate the number of troops in their vicinity, leading to the false conclusions on the number of military men.  A third reason for poor troop count is the fact of military attrition itself.  Men would be killed in border skirmishes or minor campaigns while others would die every year from disease.  Unlike older days where it was easier to recruit, the Roman Empire suffered from many plagues, diminishing the population and making it difficult to replenish the military.  These three factors help explain the reason for lower than expected numbers of Roman troops.Although a minor change, one could point to the decreasing quality of the Roman army.  Some of the evidence on the lack of quality of the Roman military was its lack of discipline in battle compared to its earlier days.  In the time of Julius Caesar and Augustus, the legions would advance slowly and silently over the field and in the final few meters charge and yell. This action took an extremely large amount of discipline and training.  In the final decades of the Western Roman Empire, the troops did the opposite; charging and howling similarly to the barbarians they were fighting.  One of the biggest factors for this change in tactic was the inevitable influence of incorporating larger numbers of barbarians into the military.  It is also important to note the Roman troops had been configured and used to fighting small border clashes.  As a result, Roman vexillations or legions had rarely fought together in pitch battle or even had the opportunity to train together.  This decrease in the quality of the Roman troops leads me to my final point.The Roman Army was partly incapable of fighting off the barbarian invasions due to its unwillingness to fight in open battle.  This was common idea in ancient warfare.  Much of the campaigning would be hallmarked mainly by maneuver and skirmishing with few battles.  In many instances, only one large battle would be fought.  Add this to the difficulty the Roman army faced in the 3rd and 4th century, mainly smaller population and replenishment problems it could and would experience if it took many casualties in battle.  Thus, the Roman army or armies were even less willing to fight in pitch battle than its Punic and Augustan counterparts due to the fact that it would face more hardships in replacing losses from battle In conclusion, the Roman army was plagued by civil war, a smaller population, corruption, lack of discipline, change of tactics, and local identity, making it difficult to fight foreign invasion.  **Edit 1**  I would like to further elaborate on a few points in the third paragraph.  With the integration and recruitment of more foreigners into the army (especially Germanic peoples), one saw an increasing influence upon the military.  First, the equipment used differed from earlier armies.  The most glaring weaponry differences was the abandonment of the gladius short sword for the long-bladed spatha sword.  In addition, Western Roman soldiers began to wear barbarian \"trousers\" instead of loose fitting tunics.  Finally, some Roman infantry behavior had changed as well.  As addressed above, some infantry utilized war cries in battle. Roman historians discuss soldiers employing a Germanic war-cry called the barritus which was characterized by a rising crescendo of yelling.  With these changes in tactics and equipment, some scholars argued that the Roman army had decayed into undisciplined warbands and in effect had become \"barbarized.\" This is probably the most commonly held myth among many mainstream readers of Roman history.  In actuality, the Roman army remained disciplined and the most formidable force in the Western World.  The new \"barbarian\" recruits into the Roman army served with distinction and bravery. Adrian Goldsworthy further elaborates stating, > \"Barbarian recruits were in general as loyal and efficient as any others, even when fighting against their own people.  Occasionally barbarian soldiers turned traitor, but so in this period did some Romans.  By the late 4th century many senior officers were of barbarian descent, yet most of these men appear to have culturally assimilated into the Roman military aristocracy^1.\"**Footnotes**1.

In it, the author claims that one of Ross's key suppliers in the early 1980's, Danilo Blandon, was diverting profits from cocaine to the same Nicaraguan rebel groups that were also receiving support from the CIA, to further American interests in the region, based on testimony given by Blandon at Ross's trial. Although clear evidence linking Blandon to the CIA was never established, his lack of prosecution suggests some level of cooperation with federal officials. However, upper level American officials knew about the smuggling since at least 1989, when a Senate subcommittee headed by John Kerry published a report called \"Drugs, Law Enforcement, and Foreign Policy\" which detailed the US complacency towards drug smuggling in the interest of national security. Senate investigators reported significant obstruction from the Justice Department and CIA officials when questioned, suggesting some level of knowledge of the smuggling by the federal government.But because of the nature of covert operations, it's impossible to say just how far knowledge of the smuggling went up the chain of command. American officials were probably involved in cocaine smuggling in the early 1980's, but to what extent and under whose orders remains a mystery. The smuggling may have been committed by rogue agents looking for personal profit, or may have been officially sanctioned to support American interests in the several civil wars occurring in the region at the time.

As such I strongly urge you to consult other actual authorities on the matter and I hope a medieval medical scholar may be able to answer your question in greater depth. I also am not terribly familiar with contemporary Jewish physicians from this period so I apologize for that lacuna. I will leave that hopefully for someone else to address.*There were numerous methods of treating open wounds in the medieval world but some particular approaches come up quite frequently. There is a long history of treating cuts with honey and/or wine stretching back to Galen and Roman antiquity. This practice endured in the Greek East following the collapse of the Roman empire in the Latin West and can be seen in the writings of seventh century writers like Paul of Aegina. Peter E. Pormann, *The Oriental Tradition of Paul of Aegina's Pragmateia* (Leiden: Brill, 2004), 302. Paul of Aegina's work was very influential on later Arab physicians, and in particular the famous Arab scholar Al-Zahrawi. This great early surgeon, also known as Albucasis, drew extensively from Paul's work and created new techniques during the tenth century in Al-Andalus. Like Paul, and indeed so many other early proponents, he emphasized the use of wine and also rose water in the healing of open lacerations in order to clean the wound and prevent infections. Albucasis, *On Surgery and Instruments: A Definitive Edition of the Arabic Text of Albucasis with English Translation* ed. and trans. M.S. Spink and G.L. Lewis (London : The Wellcome Institute of the History of Medicine, 1973), 698-710. He was a great advocate for the use of cautery and the work cited above contains some extensive commentary on his thoughts on potential uses. Cauterization was hugely important for more significant and life-threatening wounds, and in the performing of amputations during war. Cautery could help to prevent the exsanguination of the victim, although internal bleeding could continue depending upon the extent of the wound. Amputations were also massively traumatic, both physically and psychologically, so physicians were often hesitant to choose this line of treatment unless they had no other recourse. Infections as a *result* of cautery were also a distinct possibility.The use of vinegar was also common, either in addition to or instead of wine, and was recognized by Paul of Aegina for its efficacy. Richard D. Forrest, \"Early History of Wound Treatment\" *Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine* 75/3 (1982), 198-205. Al-Zahrawi's work was subsequently translated into Latin by Christian scholars such as Gerard of Cremona in the twelfth century and his ideas subsequently came to influence the trajectory of Western medicine and surgical techniques.  Iain A. MacInnes has studied the history of later medieval medicine and has demonstrated the popularity of these techniques in later centuries. He has observed that physicians continued to use wine and honey as antibacterial agents in the Latin West in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and that these remedies were important during times of war. \"Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes: Injury and Death in Anglo-Scottish Combat, c. 1296-1403\" in *Wounds and Wound Repair in Medieval Culture* ed. Larissa Taylor and Kelly Devries (Leiden: Brill, 2015), 125. Wine in particular was a useful solution to common wounds given it was readily available and easy to apply quickly. One did not need to travel far to procure it and could consequently bind the wound more rapidly. Given your question hinges on geography in 1116 it is important to note that some important questions would not really change. If you were to suffer a laceration on your hand the first question is how close are you to a physician, what is your means of transport, and are you ambulatory? These are fairly fundamental questions no matter where on Earth you happen to be located. However if you had ready access to a physician in 1116 chances are you would want to be located in Muslim Spain where treatments of this kind were commonly circulated amongst the Arab intelligentsia and medical professionals, and their methods had scientifically proven efficacy in treating open wounds. You would be well served by Byzantine physicians who were incredibly sophisticated for their time and similarly benefitted from a rich inheritance of Greek and Roman medical scholarship. Sicily would also be a good bet given the numbers of Arab and Greek scholars and physicians who frequented the island throughout the eleventh and twelfth century. Finally Italy would likely offer some good options given the number of scholars and physicians entering the Latin West through the growing nexus of trade generated by the Italian states. If you were located elsewhere in Western Europe, were not noble or royal, and had no access to a court physician privy to these new advancements in medical science the situation could be more complicated although that is not to suggest that other local remedies may not have had some efficacy.I hope this somewhat answers your question and I yield to other historians here from whom this subject is their primary expertise.", "label": 0}, {"content": "In 1116, the average life expectancy was about 30 years.

However, when ambushed in the open near Ecbatana by a swift Parthian strike force, Sidetes perished. At range, though, Parthians were deadly.

[So while 70% of Americans identify as Christian in 2014](_URL_0_), polling from a few years prior (when the number of self-identified Christians was even higher) would indicate that only a small sub-set of Christians have objections to Halloween.Let me explain why. Halloween, as another commentator noted, is a Christian Holiday, it is the Eve of the Feast of All Saints, sometimes called All Hallows Eve. It developed out of ancient practices of commemorating martyrs, but because the number of martyrs was so large, there were too many to commemorate individually and there was a fear that some would not be given the proper recognition, and so it became a common practice to have an annual Feast of All Saints, known and unknown. This was closely linked with the following \"All Souls\" day, which memorialized \" all the faithful departed.\"It should also be said that in a Christian context, the \"saints\" mean not just those who have been canonized, but all faithful Christians who have died \"in the hope of the resurrection,\" to use one common phrase. It's worth noting here that \"saints\" is used some 67 times in the New Testament and *always* refers to the entirety of the Christian community, not a subset of it. For example, [see 1 Corinthians 1:2](_URL_2_) or [Romans 1:7](_URL_1_).All Saints and All Souls are closely linked, both on the calendar and theologically, but All Saints is the most widely celebrated and in practice often subsumes All Souls entirely, at least in many Protestant Churches. In the medieval Roman Catholic church, there was (and is) a rich history of elaborate folk practices around the day, including visiting cemeteries, dressing in costumes, praying for the departed, holding processions, etc. In most places, All Saints is, and was, a time to remember the entire \"Communion of Saints.\" At the time of the Reformation, the entire idea of praying for the dead, venerating saints, and other \"superstitious\" practices that had become enormously popular in European cultures were re-examined and sometimes condemned, especially by the more radical Reformers who wanted to strip Christianity of anything that wasn't grounded in Biblical inerrency. (This is a hardline interpretation of the doctrine known as *sola scriptura*.)Halloween, and All Saints, as well as many other practices thought of as \"papist\" were firmly in the crosshairs of these radical reformers. Many of the early settlers of the United States were drawn from this group, (it's no coincidence that [20,000 Puritans left England for the Massachusetts Bay Colony](_URL_3_) in the 1630s, while they were being persecuted by Anglicans and the English Civil War was brewing) who were effectively banished (or self-exiled) from Europe and in search of religious freedom. The Puritans, the Huguenots and other radical groups would not have felt warmly about Halloween folk practices. In a sense, they were both \"papist\" AND \"pagan,\" in the Puritan mind a kind of worst case example of the corruption of Roman Catholicism at the time.  >  As for Halloween in the New England Colonies, there was no mention of it whatsoever. There could be no greater anathema to the Puritans...Ritual celebration and Catholic theology were seen as manifestations of an unfathomable evil, and the Puritans could not reconcile these beliefs with their own God. (Halloween, p. 30)So no, I think your teacher is wrong. The sentiment against Halloween isn't because it is not \"Christian.\" It's because of the fundamentalist theological views of the radical reformers. To put it another way, it's not that it's \"not christian,\" it's that it's the wrong kind of Christian. Today, the successors of the radical Reformers, largely Evangelical and Fundamentalist churches, are still opposed to Halloween, but because of the \"negative\" imagery or the focus on \"witchcraft\" or other practices that they consider to be morally objectionable.

He addressed the nobles in the senate-house and the populace from the tribunal, and being welcomed to the place with manifold attentions, he enjoyed a longed-for pleasure; and on several occasions, when holding equestrian games, he took delight in the sallies of the commons.This was of course all very traditional: the Senate was still to be respected, the people received an address from their rightful emperor, the races were still held.He also surveyed the great public buildings of Rome: >  He thought that whatever first met his gaze towered above all the rest: the sanctuaries of Tarpeian Jove so far surpassing as things divine excel those of earth; the baths built up to the measure of provinces; the huge bulk of the amphitheatre, strengthened by its framework of Tiburtine stone, to whose top human eyesight barely ascends; the Pantheon like a rounded city-district, vaulted over in lofty beauty; and the exalted heights which rise with platforms to which one may mount, and bear the likenesses of former emperors; the Temple of the City, the Forum of Peace, the Theatre of Pompey, the Odeum, the Stadium, and amongst these the other adornments of the Eternal City. But when he came to the Forum of Trajan, a construction unique under the heavens, as we believe, and admirable even in the unanimous opinion of the gods, he stood fast in amazement, turning his attention to the gigantic complex about him, beggaring description and never again to be imitated by mortal men.These buildings were of course all very famous, though even then there would have been plenty of churches, most of which were built further away from the traditional centre of the city. There were still many pagans in Rome and their hold on the urban space had yet to be contested (this would have to wait until the time of Pope Damasus, who embarked on a mass church-building programme). Constantius at this point also removed the Altar of Victory from the Senate House,  though the statue of Victory remained. The altar was possibly later restored by Julian, so if you were a visitor to the city in 361 you may well encounter something that had not been seen for years. Furthermore, to celebrate his own victory over an usurper five years previously and the twentieth year of his reign, Constantius also erected an obelisk in the Circus Maximus. The obelisk was brought all the way from Egypt in emulation of earlier efforts by Augustus and Constantine I and it was still standing by the time of Ammianus. Similar obelisks soon sprung up in Constantinople and elsewhere in Rome - copying the emperor was after all very fashionable.All in all, Rome in 361 was still an impressive city, particularly if we also draw upon Ammianus' descriptions of other events. Ammianus detested both the lazy lower classes and the degenerate rich, but his descriptions of the decadent nobles' superficial lives and the urban poor's willingness to riot over wine are enough to paint a picture by themselves. It was still a bustling city and (generally) well-supplied with grain and wine, a city with a population of around 800,000, a far-cry from the austere philosophical utopia preferred by Ammianus, but an impressive sight nonetheless. Indeed, a Persian prince who accompanied Constantius on his *adventus* had this reaction to the city:  >  When Ormisda was asked directly what he thought of Rome, he said that he took comfort in this fact alone, that he had learned that even there men were mortal.Rome in 661 on the other hand was very different. It had experienced two 'barbarian' sacks of the city in the fifth century, three sieges in the Gothic War of the sixth century, and was regularly affected by plague, famine and more sieges by the Lombards in the decades leading up to 661. It was therefore much smaller; Chris Wickham suggested that it had 1/20 of the population of Rome in the fourth century, so c.40,000. Rather than a city, it could perhaps be seen as \"a set of what could be called urban villages, maybe as many as a dozen, held together by a common politics and, probably, a continuing ritual of processions across the old classical centre.\" There were also innumerable churches and our best source for the city in this period, *The Book of Pontiffs*, a collection of papal biographies, repeatedly recorded endless church-building projects by various popes. Famous buildings like the Pantheon had also been converted to churches, though in this case quite late, only in 608. There were still new additions to the Forum however, such as the Column of Phocas dedicated to the emperor Phocas (602-610), but large-scale secular building projects had stopped. My interest though is in church history, and in that sense the city was as exciting as ever. Due to the last war with Persia between 603-28 and the Arab conquests from the 630s onwards, eastern refugees flooded west. Rome quickly became a hub for these travellers, with distinctive Armenian, Palestinian and North African monasteries all attested to. People from even further afield can also be found there, my favourite being the cult of Anastasius the Persian, a Persian martyr who was executed in 628. There were also many pilgrims, even from as far away as Anglo-Saxon England, with quite a few kings deciding to end their lives in Rome after setting aside their crowns. Infrastructure was also in place to support these visitors. Though much diminished, Rome still had a special place in the hearts of many Christians.661 also proved to be a decisive year in the long-running war between the Roman Empire and the Arab Caliphate. In that year the Umayyad caliph, Mu'awiya, emerged triumphant from the first Arab civil war and soon an offensive on all fronts was launched against the empire. Resources were swiftly mobilised by the Romans to counter this, with one event being particularly strange to modern eyes - the emperor Constans II began to prepare to sail to Italy instead of marching east. At the time though this was a very strategic move, as Italy, especially Sicily, was still relatively prosperous and provided much-needed funds for the emperor. It was also an excellent place to check Arab advances into North Africa and a place to rebuild the shattered Roman navy, an arm of the military key to any efforts to defeat the Arabs in this new 'Mediterranean world war'. Moreover, Rome was of dubious loyalty to the empire, as during a previous crisis, the war of 649-54 against the Arabs, the papacy in fact rallied Italy against the emperor, partly due to the emperor's doctrinal position. Constans managed to reassert his authority then, but the papacy was still not particularly trustworthy. Thus in 663, having arrived in Italy the previous year, Constans entered Rome, the first emperor to do so for nearly two centuries: >  The Apostolicus went to meet him [Constans] with his clergy at the 6th mile from Rome and welcomed him. On the same day the emperor travelled to St Peter\u2019s for prayer and there he presented a gift;  < another day to St Paul\u2019s and there hepresented a gift; >  on Saturday to St Mary\u2019s and again he presented a gift. OnSunday he proceeded to St Peter\u2019s with his army, all with wax tapers, and onits altar he presented a gold-wrought pallium; and mass was celebrated. Again on Saturday the emperor came to the Lateran, and bathed and dinedthere in the basilica of Vigilius. Again on Sunday there was a statio at StPeter\u2019s, and after mass was celebrated the emperor and pontiff bade farewellto each other. He stayed in Rome twelve days; he dismantled all the city\u2019sbronze decorations; he removed the bronze tiles from the roof of the church of St Mary ad martyres, and sent them to the imperial city with various other things he had dismantled. As you can see from the itinerary, the emperor spent his time visiting churches rather than the secular buildings Constantius had visited. The city was still the source of much wealth, but at this point it was in the hands of the Church rather than the senatorial aristocracy. Constans desperately needed cash to fund his war and as this also conveniently weakened the papacy, this was in fact a very astute move. The papacy however had been growing in influence for decades and this was only a temporary setback. It was an institution deeply enmeshed in the government of the city, in welfare and of course was the only thing available to provide spiritual sustenance for the inhabitants. Rome was no longer a city dominated by the secular state, as it was in 361, but now by the Church. The city may have been patrolled by imperial soldiers in 661, watchful of any seditious papal behaviour even as the crisis of empire deepened, but the loyalty of the city was now leaning towards the pope in Rome, rather than the emperor in distant Constantinople.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Roman Empire was a vast empire that ruled over most of Europe from AD361 to AD435.

But we can still talk about lions and cheetahs and polar bears! So, why?Menageries were a major aspect of what we call \"performing kingship\" (or sultanship, in this case) in the Middle Ages. Possession and display of exotic animals was a marker of highest status all around the world! Even non-kings wanted to get in on the act.You might think of the polar bear swimming in the 13th century Thames on a long chain. Or the giraffe sent from the Swahili city-states to India and on to China in the 15th century. When Spanish colonizers made it to Tenochtitlan, [they interpreted Moctezuma's collection of exotic animals as a royal menagerie, too](_URL_0_).The joy and prestige of menageries was just as true for Islamic rulers at least from Umayyad days. But you would not have seen the equivalent of a polar bear swimming in the Tigris, nor been the 17th century Norfolk woman named Mary Jenkinson, who was in the habit of petting the lions in the Tower of London. (That story does not end happily.)No, in Abbasid Baghdad, exotic animals were reserved for the sultan at his palace. Yaqut al-Rumi in the 12th century says that the menagerie area also included an aviary and a hunting park. Later sources suggest that menageries weren't just open-environment Jurassic Park-type free-for-alls, but included stables, fences, and other structures for animals' and keepers' protection.Unfortunately for us and Abul Abbaz, Arabic sources tend to say a lot more about animals *incoming* than *outgoing*. For the Abbasid era, they also tend to still be in Arabic which I do not read. So I hope it is okay if I draw from near-contemporary Turkey and from Mamluk rule to give some flavor of what animals might have come to Abbasid Baghdad from Indian, Arabia, Central Asia, and Africa.In 1258, the Ilkhanate infamously sacked Baghdad. In 1263, the Golden Horde proposed joint anti-Ilkhanate action with the Mamluk rulers. Along with a whole mess of other diplomatic gifts, they reached out to signal their sincerity with:* elephants* giraffes* Arabian stallions* multiple kinds of donkey* what Donald Little refers to as \"racing camels\" and boy do I want to know about medieval camel races now* Arabian racehorses, specificallyOh, and also various armour and clothing and other accoutrements for the animals, of course.(Animal clothing was A Thing in the medieval world. Medieval Arab veterinary writers are deeply unhappy with the owners of hunting dogs keeping them warm in clothing of fine brocade instead of in leftover scraps. In the case of gifts, of course, we are thinking something along Indian wedding dress lines...probably not so much for hunting dogs.)Al-Maqrizi, visiting a royal menagerie in 9th century Turkey (shortly after Charlemagne's day), was very impressed with the animal selection and hence with ruler Khumarawayh:* songbirds (discussed at some length)* elephants* tigers* cheetahs* giraffes* horses* camels* donkeysand--as we might imagine poor Mary Jenkinson had once believed--a pair of lions who were especially beloved by and tame for the sultan.So we have no words from an Abbasid zookeeper weeping at the loss of their elephant to the Frankish barbarians (as contemporary Arabic sources would have it), or of their family devasted by losing a member to the expedition north. But we can paint a lavish picture of the animal world of early medieval rulers, and of sultans taking the time out of a stressful day to pet their lions.", "label": 0}, {"content": "In 797, Charlemagne sent an embassy to the court of Harun al-Rashid. 5 years later, the embassy would return with numerous exotic gifts from Baghdad, including an elephant.

In the 1900s, Montreal, Canada was one of the Mecca's in neuroscience and still is. There was a guy named [Dr. Ewan Cameron](_URL_0_) who at points in his life was the head of the American Psychiatric Association (1952\u20131953), Canadian Psychiatric Association (1958\u20131959), American Psychopathological Association (1963), Society of Biological Psychiatry (1965) and World Psychiatric Association (1961\u20131966). He had a theory and afaik was the one who came up with the \"Depatterning\" idea of giving drugs then subjecting people to images with their eyelids kept open, think Clockword Orange and the stereotypes of that kind of \"mind control\" or \"mind wiping\". His research was funded by the U.S. government. While he knew his research was being funded by a foreign government, I'm not sure if he knew it was being funded by CIA/more secretive groups. Regardless, he was doing some heinous research with the money.People would go for depatterning at his institution of the neurological institute, be completely messed up, substance induced or activate a permanent psychosis, then they would end up at the hospital, then to Mcgill, then hospital, then to the Peter Allan institute. There was little cross-talk between institutions even in the same city and people would be shunted from one to the next in the worst cases. This is how it went undetected. Otherwise, people probably thought \"o they didn't get a lobotomy, they must be crazy though, wonder how they got this way, must be in their blood\".Even Donald Hebb, of \"fires together, wires together\" fame was funded by the same foreign bodies but he claims he didn't know how insidious the money was, and we believed him. That's another story and he is a well loved and important figure in neuroscience. Ewan Cameron, however, who's heard of him anymore? He permanently injured and indirectly killed many with his depatterning. ------**All in all,** the CIA funded research all over the world, it was decentralized and they looked for researchers with credentials and no scruples to conduct the kind of research we know they did. It also took ignorance, willful or otherwise, a different time and standards of care/research subjects, as well as no one connecting the dots.  Think of it this way, you are a scientist with existing research, a granting body promises money in return for your research, you take the money in return for giving your results to them. Maybe it's only 1/4 of the research your lab does anyway, you take the money from this non-scientific body and your department either doesn't know or doesn't think it's all that bad or out of the ordinary. Not familiar with how the dots were connected or by whom but I hope this gives a picture of the actual context for how things went down.- editing to add that also, because of the lack of what we consider modern scientific rigor, not only were Ewan Cameron's findings unethical, the research methods were crap. They did not work to \"depattern\" or \"wipe a mind\" like he claimed.

John Richards of Boston who was going home, So being very glad of his Company we Rode something harder than hitherto, and missing my way in going up a very steep Hill, my horse dropt down under me as Dead; this new surprize no little hurt me meeting it Just at the Entrance into Dedham from whence we intended to reach home that night. But was now obliged to gett another Hors there and leave my own, resolving for Boston that night if possible.As Massachusetts teacher Sarah Kemble Knight presents it in her 1705 diary, the exhaustion of her never-named horse was something more than a mere inconvenience, but less than a tragedy. The surprise still \"no little hurt me\" despite her being in just about the best possible place to have to swap out horses. But she--and whichever Dedham stable owner she encountered--saw no drama in swapping out horses.Some people absolutely did develop stronger bonds with their horse. Right around the time of Knight's journey, a horse owner from Appomac in Virginia named their mare \"Noby.\" Contemporary journals from the same area indicate that naming an animal was a sign of affection, not just utility--f.ex. cases where only one cow is noted as having a name, and is described with extra tenderness.But in general, Knight's matter-of-factness about the horses that enabled her Boston-New York trip reflects the evolution of advice prescribed in horse-training and related manuals. Karen Raber and Treva Tucker sum up the general arc in their introduction to *The Culture of the Horse: Status, Discipline, and Identity in the Early Modern World.*In the 16th and early 17th century, different types of texts recommend force, even abuse, for training horses--the idea being very much a rational man versus irrational nature combat. \"Bit-Books\" are just that: descriptions and illustrations of bits, concentrating on how the human can gain forceful control over the horse. Pia Cunco describes the early modern attitude towards bits: >  The longer theshank, the greater the leverage when the rein is activated, and thegreater the pressure that is exerted on the horse\u2019s sensitive oraltissues. The greater the pressure, the greater the pain, and that waswhat solved the practical problem of regulating a horse\u2019s pace. >  As the brief texts of the bit-books make clear, different bits wereimplemented according to different training and behavioralproblems. But Traber traces a gradual evolution moving further into the seventeenth century. Richard, earl of Newcastle, wrote in 1658: > Great pains then must be taken to make a horse fear his rider, that so he mayobey out of self-love, that he may avoid punishment. A horse\u2019s love isnot so safe to be trusted to, because it depends on his own will;whereas his fear depends on the will of the rider, and that is being adressed horse. But when the rider depends on the will of the horse, itis the horse that manages the rider. Love then is of no use; fear doesall.Obviously this sounds rather horrific, but there is something to be said about Newcastle's emphasis on *fear*. He's thinking about the horse's spirit, temperment, and (as is evident elsewhere in the treatise) thoughts: >  [The horse] is wise and subtile: for which reason man ought carefully to preserve his empire over him, knowing how nearly that wisdom and subtiltyapproaches his own.The methods of training are still abusive, but there's more of a sense of a possible relationship--even if it's one of pure domination.It's in the 18th century--the decades after Knight rode and wrote--that Traber sees training manuals advocating a more cooperative relationship. But there is still, she notes, absolutely no sense anywhere of a pet-type relationship.This prescriptive advice is borne out in later diaries. Caroline Barnes Crosby's fascinating diary/memoirs of New York to Utah, and Utah to California, from the mid-19th century moves a step beyond Knight in terms of her willingness to portray affection for horses. But there is still a profoundly utilitarian sense. In the middle of a rough New York winter, she writes: >  We waited one day forthe snow to settle a little, and then set forth towards Lake Erie, found thesnow very deep, in some places. Mr Crosby walked nearly all the way; ourpretty black horse began to get thin, and look sober. Crosby's horse doesn't have a name, but she mentions it affectionately. And her description of its struggles goes a smidge beyond Knight's \"and it almost died.\" It's not a fluke. In 1836, she wrote: >  We found the roads almost impassable, the mud was up tothe horses knees. We had a hard time, was nearly a week going 100 miles. Our horse's breast became very sore. It gave me very unpleasant feelingsto see him work in such misery.She portrays herself empathizing with the horse!But at the same time, horses were still a utilitarian possession. In 1848, her family encountered a group of Sioux riders \"dressed in very spendid indian style\" (...you think?). She writes that they traded a little bit and \"swaped horses\" [sic]. No detail, no description, no drama.There still isn't a sense of \"horses as pets.\" And in fact, even in 1976, anthropologist Marshall Sahlins could remark that while the human-dog relationship resembled one of *family*, horses were traditionally treated more as servants or \"nonkin\" (friends?) even when they had personal names and \" we are in the habit of conversing with them as we do not talk to pigs and cattle.\" But even before horses ceased to be a primary mode of transportation, we can trace a long evolution *towards* a relationship closer to pets or friends than servants or beasts.", "label": 0}, {"content": "When horses were used for transportation in the US, they were treated affectionately like pets or as interchangeable tools.

Sherman was one of the few men in the country who understood that the war would be a calamitous one and would require a minimum of 200,000 men to put down the rebellion.     For this figure, he was ridiculed as insane, just as if he had asked for 10 million men, and newspapers of the day rushed to print it as fact, and an ill-advised comment by one of Sherman\u2019s fellow officers was spread across the country as fact before anyone could contradict it. It wasn\u2019t until the battle of Shiloh that people realized how bloody the war was actually going to be, and the events of the war proved Sherman\u2019s estimates in fact had been much too low.   Now, I believe the best source on this is Sherman himself, taken from his memoirs.     He spoke to Secretary of war Cameron in Louisville, KY on what he considered the woeful unpreparedness of the Union line in the center, which Sherman commanded from that state.     He laid out a map of the country in front of Cameron, and showed that in the East, General McClellan was given 100,000 men to hold a line 100 miles across the front. In the far west, Fremont had 60,000 men to hold a line also about 100 miles across. Meanwhile, Sherman had only 18,000 men to hold a line 300 miles across.     He argued that for defense alone, to force the rebels out of Kentucky, he required 60,000 men, and if the Union was to take the offensive, that figure would need to be at least 200,000. This incident was the source for the later claims that he was insane.     As Sherman describes the sequence of events,   > \u201cOn reaching Washington, Mr. Cameron called on General Thomas, as he himself afterward told me, to submit his memorandum of events during his absence, and in that memorandum was mentioned my *insane* request for 200,000 men. By some newspaper man this was seen and published, and, before I had the least conception of it, I was universally published throughout the country as \u201cinsane, crazy,\u201d etc.\u201d    From there, the rumor twisted and spread across the country as newspapers all rushed to report it as fact, and no one if Sherman\u2019s superiors raised any effort to countermand it.    > \u201cAbout this time my attention was drawn to the publication in all the Eastern papers, which of course was copied to the West, of the report that I was \u201ccrazy, insane, and mad,\u201d that \u201cI had demanded two hundred thousand men for the defense of Kentucky;\u201d and the author given for this report was stated to be the Secretary of War himself, Mr. Cameron, who never, to my knowledge, took pains to affirm or deny it.\u201d   Sherman bitterly suffered through these insults for a few months, and he regards how during this time, he resented the suspicion with which his own junior officers regarded his every order as a result. The coming battle of Shiloh however proved Sherman correct in his estimation of the war.   I won\u2019t go too much into the battle itself, but the rebel offensive unfolded exactly as Sherman had feared and predicted. 40,000 confederate troops, under the command of Albert Sydney Johnston, sensed the weakness of the Union line in the center, and fell upon Union forces camped out along the Tennessee River. This had been precisely the portion of the western theater Sherman had held, Tennessee being due south of Kentucky, and had asked to be relieved of commanding as a result of the rumors, and the effect they had both on his own mental health and his confidence in the men under his command to carry out their orders.   Despite the public perception of him, however, which even when he returned to the army saw Sherman placed in rear echelon positions of logistics and supply, Ulysses S. Grant still had faith in Sherman\u2019s abilities as a war commander, and Sherman was placed under his command at Shiloh. The events of Shiloh resulted in over 20,000 casualties and gave Sherman the chance to not only prove his estimation of the war\u2019s requirements in manpower absolutely correct, but also the chance to distinguish himself on the battlefield as a commanding general.   After the battle, both Sherman\u2019s superior officers and the country as a whole realized he had been correct all along, and the war was going to be a long and costly one, redeeming himself in the public eye and causing the rumors to quietly disappear on their own.   Sherman includes in his memoirs a letter written to the public after the war by General Thomas Wood, then in command of the Military District of Vicksburg, regarding the meeting which had prompted the rumors in the first place and the events that followed. Emphasis mine.    > \u201cFor the purpose of expelling the rebels from Kentucky, General Sherman said that at least sixty thousand soldiers were necessary. Considering that the means of accomplishment must always be proportional to the end to be achieved, and bearing in mind the array of rebel forces then in Kentucky, **every sensible man must admit that the estimate of the force given by General Sherman, for driving the rebels out of Kentucky, was a very low one. The truth is that, before the rebels were driven from Kentucky, many more that sixty thousand soldiers were sent into the state.**    > Ascending from the consideration of the narrow question of the political and military situation in Kentucky, and the extent of the force necessary to redeem the State from rebel thralldom...General Sherman expressed the opinion that, to carry the war to the Gulf of Mexico, and destroy all armed opposition to the government in the entire Mississippi valley, at least two hundred thousand men were absolutely requisite.    > \u2026\u2026.   > A short time after the council was held\u2026an imperfect narrative of it appeared in the New York Tribune. This account announced to the public the conclusion uttered by General Sherman in the council, without giving the reasons on which his conclusions were based. **The unfairness of this course to General Sherman needs no comment.

It really depends on what you mean by 'elite'. On one hand you could mean the biggest, strongest and smartest soldiers deployed for particularly difficult tasks, or you could mean forces employed for special tasks which required specific skills outside of the chain of command, like the special forces of today, who are 'force multipliers' rather than super hard as nails fighting men.One example is the Macedonian pages under Philip, who could be selected for special tasks like creeping around at night and waving signal torches at the discretion of the king, or so forth. What we may regard as special forces are known to have been around in various functions within Roman forces, such as the 'speculatores' who could be called upon to perform special tasks such as gathering information rather than just the ordinary foot-slogging of the legions proper, [similar to the functions fulfilled by modern special forces](_URL_1_).The Spartan 'krypteia' can be regarded as some branch of special operations, though academia is divided over exactly what it was (it may have been more than one thing).

There is no TL/DR, because this isn't Buzzfeed, and you're a fucking adult.I imagine there's a lot of you who aren't familiar with the TU-144, even if you've heard of the Concorde. Let's do a quick recap. Back in the 1950s and 1960s, aeronautical engineering was caught up in the spirit of \"faster, farther, higher.\" Engineers and the public were interested in the next leap forward in aviation and space. They wanted aircraft that would press the limits of the cutting edge. Mundane things like passenger comfort, fuel efficiency and economics were considered rarely, if at all.In the late 1950s, the United States, the Soviet Union and European nations independently began projects to develop a supersonic airliner. The American model was the Boeing 2707; it never flew. The Soviet Union announced its plans quietly at the start of 1962. Owing to the high cost of designing and building a supersonic transport, the British and French governments agreed to cooperate. In the spirit of cooperation, they agreed to name their aircraft *Concorde*, the French equivalent of the English word \"concord,\" meaning agreement.Through the 1960s, the Soviet, American and European teams advanced their designs. On Dec. 31, 1968, the Soviets wheeled out their prototype, the Tupolev-144, for its maiden flight. The first flight was conducted with no announcement -- the Soviets wanted to be able to conceal it if it failed. It didn't fail. The Tu-144 made three passes over its airfield in a flight lasting 28 minutes, and pictures of the Soviet aircraft were flashed around the world, trumpeting the Soviet technological triumph.Where the Soviet aircraft had been developed quietly, the Concorde had been developed in public, and even before its maiden flight in March 1969, its distinctive shape was well known. Thus, when images of the Soviet aircraft were released and [compared to that of the Concorde](_URL_1_), it was no wonder that the Tu-144 soon became nicknamed the \"Concordski.\"While they looked similar on the surface, the Concorde and Tu-144 had their differences. Though they both had a drooped nose and delta wing (and indeed, so did the Boeing 2707), the Tupolev's wing was less sculpted. Its engine pod was beneath the cabin, not the wings. Its cockpit instrumentation, cooling system and internal structure was different.For the next four years, both the Concorde and the Tu-144 were tested and refined. The Tupolev had problems with control at low speed, so engineers added a swinging set of canard wings, tiny flaps just behind the cockpit that could be extended to aid control at low speed. The Tupolev landed faster than the Concorde, but it was faster in the air. It could carry more passengers and more cargo. With the cancellation of the Boeing 2707 project in 1971, there were open questions about whether the Concorde or the Tu-144 would dominate the future of air travel.The 1973 Paris Air Show was poised to be the showdown.The annual air show is an impromptu aircraft showroom for buyers and sellers. It brings together the airlines and air manufacturers. In the past, it's been used as a venue for attempts to set airspeed or altitude records. It's also a huge tourist attraction and viewed by millions of people who travel to Paris just for this event.The Concorde performed its demonstration flight first, and it did so flawlessly. The Tu-144 taxied into position, and the French suddenly radioed that its demonstration time would be cut in half -- a last-ditch attempt to shame the Soviet aircraft against its half-French competitor.[What came next changed aviation history.](_URL_0_)After the crash of the Tu-144 in Paris, the two aircraft had markedly different histories. The Concorde went on to limited commercial success, serving trans-oceanic flights until 2003. The Tu-144 was a commercial flop, making only 55 scheduled passenger flights. It later became a testbed for supersonic flight (including NASA-run missions), and that may be its biggest success.But I haven't answered your question yet. For that, you'll have to move on to the next comment, because I've run out of space ...", "label": 0}, {"content": "The TU-144 was a Soviet supersonic airliner that was developed in the late 1960s.

Apathy and a non-caring attitude was. It sounds like a bit of a trite clich\u00e9 but the thing is that in order for genocide like the Holocaust to succeed, it is not necessary to have a population the majority of which is willing to slaughter millions of people. What you need is a population, the majority of which is apathetic towards the fate of their neighbors. Who is willing to stand by and do nothing while their neighbors are arrested, taken away, and killed.The boycott was a failure because it relied too heavily on large swaths of the population being involved, especially in the urban centers where a lot of Jews lived and because a variety of stores and chains that were very convenient in those urban centers were also declared as targets of the boycott such as Woolworth (Woolworth was and is not a \"Jewish store\", even by Nazi standards).Historian Janosch Steuwer has focused his research on diaries written in the years between 1933 and 1939 in his book *Ein Drittes Reich wie ich es auffasste* (A Third Reich how I perceived it) and based on these studies Steuwer writes that for the Nazi regime, their policy of social transformation through the collaboration of vast swaths of said society was heavily dependent on individual actions or rather non-actions. The Nazis' policy of course aimed for active involvement but was happy enough with apathy and a non-caring attitude that focused on an individual's lack of options or lack of care. The boycott represented a crucial learning experience in that regard.The boycott was a flop because to many a German it represented a major inconvenience, not because an overall opposition to anti-Jewish measure. Something that the Nazis soon realized over the course of the boycott is that many Germans who were not opposed to their policies on principle or on ideological grounds still would retain the idea of their own \"good Jew\". Meaning that for many a German, they would go along with ideas such as Judeo-Bolshevism being a problem that needed to be fought by the new government but old Mr. Goldziegel where they bought their groceries was not related to that problem to them. They acknowledged that Jews were \"bad\" in principle with the whole world conspiracy thing and Bolshevism but to them, their grocer Goldziegel or their shoemaker Rosenstein had nothing to do with that. They were \"good Jews\" after all.The very core of the Nazi social project was called the \"Volksgemeinschaft\" (people's / racial community). It represented the idea of a coherent racial national community in which all categories that divided the Germans from each other (class, Catholic and Protestant denomination etc.) would be abolished to form one harmonious community of the people. One of the main obstacles to this utopian community of all Germans living under the guidance of the F\u00fchrer were those who did not belong: Jews, socialists, communists, so-called asocials and so forth. To achieve \"Volksgemeinschaft\" it was both necessary to do what essentially boils down to community building but always coupled with the explicit necessity of \"cleansing\" the community from the \"foreign\" and the other.Through community measures, from enabling people who otherwise were unable to drive cars in the NSKK, to organizing Sunday meals with the NS-Frauenschaft, to collective sports, to enabling people to go on holidays through the KdF to hundreds of similar activities, the Nazis build a consensus among the Germans that the regime was good to them and therefore would at least go quietly along with the exclusion of the various others from the community. In 1933, expecting people to boycott their grocer whom they had known for years was, as the regime noted, a bridge too far. But by 1938 when during the November pogrom members of the SA and SS burned down stores and arrested people en masse, what had occured was that the regime had fostered a popular attitude of \"the Nazis are doing good stuff for us, so how bad could they be?\"This consent was manufactured through community activities, popular measures by the regime such as arresting communists, political successes such as the re-militarization of the Rhineland and from profiting from the end of the world economic crisis. I have talked about [framing before here](_URL_0_) and the central issue is that via propagating the Volksgemeinschaft, doing community building geared paired with the explicit need of the need to get rid of outsiders, the social and thereby individual frame of what was acceptable to the German population moved towards harsher and more radical measure being at least accepted if people didn't start to participate outright.The push towards cruelty and criminality was always paired with measure positive for the majority population and clad in a language of necessity and also often security. If Jews were arrested and imprisoned by the Nazis, it was because they were criminals or communists. If they were deported, people told themselves that was because they were going to the East to be resettled despite in many cases knowing better. If an ordinary Wehrmacht soldier was ordered to shoot women and children, kill people by using them as living mine probes, and so forth it was because these people were Partisans, because they were dangerous to the Germans by their mere presence, because it was lawful as he was told.In 1933/34 when the boycott was called, vast swaths of society were still not ready to forsake something convienent to them for political reasons. The process of moving the frame, of re-framing these actions, of changing individual behavior at large takes time and is largely achieved through measures considered in some way positive to those parts of the population not affected by these measures of exclusion and also by constructing an atmosphere of fear and danger. Bolshevism, for example, was something that represented danger to most Germans, especially those who had lived through the end of WWI and had seen revolution. By constantly associating Jews with Bolsheviks and highlighting how other, un-German, and so forth they were, this atmosphere of fear and danger was created. But at the same time the regime would institute measure beneficial and positive to the majority population because they needed both in order to convince people of the larger concept of the Volksgemeinschaft that was so instrumental on moving individual and social frames of behavior.In creating a claim to empowerment by actively working towards the Volksgemeinschaft, individual Germans became willing to commit crimes on a massive scale or at least ignore them or be apathetic towards them.Sources:* Janosch Steuwer: Ein Drittes Reich wie ich es auffasste.* Michael Wildt: Volksgemeinschaft als Selbsterm\u00e4chtigung.

Franz Ferdinand, Austria-Hungary, and the Eastern Front in general are totally disregarded when it comes to the First World War. By most popular accounts, Franz Ferdinand was shot and killed, and that's all he was ever good for. In my opinion, however, he's one of the most important figures in pre-War Austrian military history.Archduke Franz Ferdinand was the heir apparent of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His uncle, Franz Josef, had come to power after his uncle abdicated in 1848, among the violent social upheavals which occurred all across Europe, and certainly within Austria-Hungary. Franz Josef had risen to the throne at age 18; by the time Franz Ferdinand would be assassinated, the man was 84 years old. The Archduke was 50 himself. Franz Josef was a hard worker by all accounts, though perhaps a bit uncreative and \"stuck in his ways.\" Geoffrey Wawro, whose recent work on Austria-Hungary before and during the War is an excellent read, claims that Franz Josef \"refused to take his job seriously.\" I for one don't buy it, but there are two sides to every coin in history, especially when dealing with personalities like those of Franzes Josef and Ferdinand. Some called for Franz Josef to abdicate in favor of his nephew, but Franz Josef refused, perhaps due to the infamous dislike he held for his newphew, the Crown Prince.Both men were intensely involved with the military. This is important, as Austria-Hungary's military preparedness for the First World War - from weaponry to tactics to leadership - was lacking. This is not to say that neither one tried. Franz Josef came to power in 1848, when Hungarian and Italian separatists threatened to disembowel his new Empire. The army, under the command of Feldmaraschall Radetzky, kept the Empire together. Franz Josef knew he owed his very throne to the Army and sort of took it under his wing. Indeed, for the rest of his life, Franz Josef would wear a military uniform instead of a civilian one.Annnnyyyyways, Franz Ferdinand is appointed Army Inspector. This is where things get messy. The military high command in the Austro-Hungarian Empire was a constant battle of cliques and intrigues. Both FJ, as Emperor and Commander-in-Chief, *and* FF, as heir-apparent and Army Inspector, had their favorite generals and their own cliques. They also disagreed widely on issues of strategy and politics. Franz Josef, like I've said, came to power in 1848, and subsequently lost Austria's Italian territories, as well as it's influence on German politics, in two wars, one against the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont and one against Prussia. After two embarassing military defeats, Franz Josef was content to sit on his throne and keep the territories he still had intact - no more, no less. Franz Ferdinand, on the other and, had muuuucccchhhh bigger plans.Necessary detour into Austro-Hungarian internal politics. Much has been made of A-H's multi-ethnic makeup, and rightly so. Check out this [map](_URL_0_) of Austria-Hungary's many different ethnic groups. As the second largest and most powerful behind the German-Austrians, the Hungarians successfully bargained for a two-state empire united by one Emperor. This is super complex political stuff, so if you'd like more explanation, let me know in the comments and I'll give you as much information as you'd like. *Basically*, from 1867 on, the Austrian Empire was formally known as Austria-Hungary and the Hungarian Parliament had massive influence on the decision-making of Austria-Hungary. They used this influence to hamper the development of the Empire's army and keep Bosnia-Herzegovina underdeveloped (more info on that as well, if you'd like). Franz Josef was content to let the Hungarians be; Franz Ferdinand wasn't so easily put off. He claimed that Austria-Hungary's main foe wasn't other Great Powers, but \"\u201cinternal enemy\u2014Jews, Freemasons, Socialists and Hungarians.\u201d He even sat down with his uncle, the Emperor, and demanded that a plan be drawn up for an eventual invasion of Hungary aimed at putting the Hungarians back in their proper place, that is, firmly under the heel of German Austria. His favorite General was Conrad von Hotzendorf, an interesting man. Some called him an armchair general who \"fought with pen and ink.\" If he was an armchair general, he was certainly one of the best there ever was, writing prolifically on strategy. As an actual battlefield commander, however, he left much to be desired. Hotzendorf and Franz Ferdiand favored pre-emptive wars against the Serbs and especially the Italians.Franz Ferdinand, tired of his uncle's punctiliousness, established his own apparatus for army administration to parallel that of the official High Command. This was headquartered at the Belvedere Palace in Vienna. It's incredibly absurd, but he had appointed his own ministers of war, foreign deputies and internal affairs. It was basically a shadow government which often went afoul of the official bodies of government. As military inspector, however, Franz Ferdinand meant to modernize the imperial army. He replaced all of the corps commanders of the Austrian military, all without the approval of his uncle, the Emperor. By the time he was murdered, politicians in Vienna were complaining that they not only had two Parliaments (Austrian and Hungarian) but two Emperors (FJ and FF).Franz Ferdinand was hugely important because he was a \"heartbeat away\" as they say, from being the Emperor of Austria-Hungary. He was set on policies of \"putting the Hungarians in their place\" and modernizing the army, which he attempted, but was often hampered by Austria's poor finances and muddled internal politics. Franz Ferdinand and his pet, von Hotzendorf, were huge proponents of using the army as a tool of internal politics as well as external aggrandizement. Franz Ferdinand never got to the throne, as he was murdered, but if he had, the entire history of Europe might have been different. He didn't *do* much but he held and propagated ideas which were opposite or different than those the Empire ultimately took under Franz Josef. Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he made his fatal final visit, was to be \"Austrianized\" and serve as an outpost from which to unite Europe's southern Slavic population against Germany, Russia, *Hungary*, etc. This would have been at the expense of the other state eyeing Bosnia,: the new Kingdom of Serbia. Gavrilo Princip shot and killed not only the visiting Habsburg prince, but the leading proponent of an active and aggressive policy against Serbian expansion in the Balkans.As for the man he was and how well people of his time knew him... By most accounts he wasn't a very likeable guy. His wife was very religious and this made him somewhat \"preachy\" - the opposite of the quietly devout Franz Josef. He was brusque and didn't laugh a lot. But he was energetic and had big plans for the Empire.He also caused a stir by marrying out of royalty. He begged his uncle, the Emperor, to allow him to marry Sophie Chotek, a Czech aristocrat who was, nevertheless, far below the rank of a Habsburg Emperor-to-be. Franz Josef eventually allowed them to have a Morganatic marriage, in which he acknowledged that she would never be styled \"Empress of Austria-Hungary\" and that his children by her would never inherit the title of Emperor.Sorry to ramble, but this is one of my favorite topics; I'm actually in Vienna right now doing research on the Habsburg Army at the Austrian Archives and I was literally *just* at the Belvedere Palace this morning. Plus, no one ever really cares about Austria in World War I. Austria-Hungary and the Eastern Front are really the forgotten topics of the First World War (though with the 100th centennial, lots of new works are coming out). I could go on and on about this, so if you want more information or some clarification on some complex points, just ask in the comments.

Here are some most obvious differences to consider; 1) the Romans did not always account technological advancement as much to the efforts of a line of human inventors, but saw it as a divine process which was influenced by gods and Nature; and 2) the Romans would not have separated 'technological' progress from other arts and science (literature, philosophy, theatre, poetry, astronomy...) as strictly as we do; and finally 3) the Romans did not see technological advancement as a purely positive thing: it had a corrupting effect on morals. Ancient Romans, like all advanced societies, realized they had once been simpler. The Roman authors often examined the process by which their standard of living had improved. But, when historical sources are absent, logic, emotion, and religion become rational sources of explanation. Sometimes the ancients can assign a certain invention to a historical figure, but sometimes inventions (especially the most ancient and fundamental ones) are pictured as gifts from gods; e.g. Philostratus on painting: > For the person wishing to devise cleverly, the discovery of painting comes from the gods - observe that the *Horai* ['Seasons'] paint the meadows on the earth and the displays in the sky\u2014but for the person seeking the origin of art, imitation is the eldest invention and the most related to nature; the wise invented it, calling it now painting, now plastic art.   > Philostratus, Imagines 1.1 (294.5\u201312)Elder Pliny, writing during the early Empire, devices a list of where all the different innovations of the army came from. As you can see, he does not separate the purely technological advancement from the abstract, and he indeed believes that truces and treaties were invented by one historical person. Also, although looks like he might be right on some things e.g. that ballistas came from the Phoenicians, we should probably be a bit sceptic about whether Mars\u2019 son developed the spear or whether the Centaurs invented cavalry tactics\u2026  >  The Africans were the first to use clubs \u2014 they call them \u201cstaves\u201d \u2014when they battled the Egyptians. Shields were invented, if not by Chalcus son of Athamas, then by Proetus and Aerisius while they were campaigning against each other. Midias of Messene invented the breastplate. The helmet, sword, and spear were inventions of the Spartans, and greaves and crests for helmets came from the Carians. Some say Jupiter\u2019s son Scythes invented the bow and arrow, though others attribute the latter to Perseus\u2019 son Perses. Lances were developed by the Aetolians, the spear with a throwing strap by Aetolus, Mars\u2019 son, the light skirmishing spears by Tyrrenus, likewise the heavy javelin, the battle-axe by Penthesilea the Amazon. Pisaeus is credited with hunting spears and the version of missile-throwers called the scorpion, while the Cretans invented the catapult and the Phoenicians the ballista and sling. > The bronze war-trumpet came from Tyrrenus\u2019 son Pisaeus, the *testudo* from Artemon of Clazomenae, and, from Epius while at Troy, the style of siege-engine called the \u201chorse,\u201d now the \u201cram.\u201d Bellerophon invented horse riding, Pelethronius reins and saddles, and the Centaurs \u2014 Thessalians who lived beside Mt. Peleus \u2014 cavalry tactics. The Phrygian race was the first to harness two horses to a chariot, and it was Erichthonius who added two more. During the Trojan War Palamedes invented military formation, the password, tokens for recognition, and sentinels; Sinon in the same war invented signalling from watchtowers. Truces and treaties were invented by Lycaon and Theseus respectively.   > the Elder Pliny, Natural History 7.200\u20132The ancients believed that the inspiration for technological advancement came from the Nature. The gods had given people the skills of deliberation, speech, social organization etc. over other animals, and these skills produced strife, jealousy, and rivalry that resulted in technological and economic innovations, as humans strived to find tools to rise above animals and each other. Nature was thus the spark that drove people to build and invent; some ancients, like the Roman Republican architect Vitruvius, also believed that even the most artificial mechanisms could also ultimately be found in Nature, and human invention was simply imitation of Nature: >  All mechanisms are created by nature and founded on the revolution of the universe, our guide and teacher. For example let us first contemplate and examine the continuous motion of the sun, moon, and the five planets. Unless they revolved by natural means, we would not have had alternating light [and dark] nor would fruits ripen. Thus when our ancestors had realized that this was so, they took their examples from nature, and by imitating natural examples they were borne onward by divine truths which they adapted to their way of living. As a result they discovered that some things were more easily done with machines [*machina*] and their revolutions, some others with instruments [*organum*]. Thus they took care to improve gradually by their learning all those things which they believed useful for research, for the arts, and for established traditions.   > Vitruvius, On Architecture 10.1.4\u20136 This is not the case with all ancients though, and e.g. Aristotle had in Classical Athens specifically seen machines and devices as a sign of people rising ABOVE nature; Vitruvius is probably influenced by the Hellenistic school of Stoic philosophy. But, both Aristotle and Vitruvius believed that because nature was the main source for human advancement, climate and geographical location had an effect on the progress of a society. Aristotle says that cold climates are \"lacking in intelligence and art\" but have too much spirit, reducing their people to a level of impulsive barbarians, whereas Greece is ideally located to have all the spirit, intelligence and art. The Roman architect Vitruvius similarly believed that Italy was ideally located for an advanced, civilized and innovative people.Consequently, the Romans did not really use Greece (as the OP mentioned ancient Troy) as a measuring stick for their technological advancement. After all, the Greeks were also a civilized and sophisticated people who possessed *humanitas*, and all Roman intellectuals read Greek texts. There are passages that say something to the effect \u2018we Romans build baths and aqueducts and roads which the Greeks did not\u2019, but it does not make the Romans *superior* to the Greeks. Again and again Roman writers like Cato, Columella, Frontinus, and Pliny the Elder stress the practicality of Roman culture over the Greeks that manifests in Roman agriculture, administration, and military, but because the Romans considered the Greeks more advanced in their language, literature, and arts, the Roman did not see themselves as more advanced than the Greeks. The Romans did, however, spent a lot of time comparing themselves to the 'simple and unadvanced barbarians' around them, and very much believed that civilizing other peoples was part of their imperial enterprise; not always to a positive effect, as Tacitus believes (he\u2019s talking about his father-in-law\u2019s campaign in Britain):  > The following winter [A.D. 79] was spent in very beneficial consultations. For in order that the scattered and barbaric Britons, a people ready for war, might be accustomed to pleasure by means of peace and relaxation, Agricola, by praising the enthusiastic and scolding the lazy, urged on individuals and assisted communities to construct temples, market places, and homes\u2026 Gradually the Britons yielded to the enticing vices: the covered porticoes, the baths, and the elegance of banquets. And this condition was called \u201ccivilization\u201d among simple Britons, although it was part of their slavery.   >  Tacitus, Agricola 21 This Tacitean passage reveals another Roman attitude towards technological progress; it is in fact not always good. The  Romans believed that long time ago, their people had lead a very primitive existence of early humans, a time in which society was too simple to create its own technological inventions, where life was all about family, simple pastoral and strictly religious life style, and war. These earlier Romans were also morally superior to the contemporary Romans. Baths, games, luxuries, riches, and machines had corrupted the virtues of family, piety, respect, frugality, and masculinity that the Roman society had once had. The Romans loved dwelling in this sort of golden-hazed nostalgia towards their imagined, mythohistorical past. The Romans placed the historical Troy and Trojan wars to this period of heroic and glorious past. So, although the Romans might have recognized that they now had weapons that the archaic Greeks did not have, they would have never considered their society superior to that of the Troy of ancient heroes. The Romans did not see technological advancement as the the most important criterion for the well-being and sophistication of a society the same way that we moderns might do.

One of the wealthiest businessmen in New Zealand, Thomas Russell, made a fortune during the goldrush by selling shiploads of onions to San Francisco, seeing that the large number of new arrivals to the city would require food. His father and brothers had travelled to California themselves, hoping to make their fortunes on the goldfields. There is plenty of evidence to suggest regular travel between the two regions was possible.A major cause of migration during the 1800s was a desire to make one's fortune. New Zealand had been populated by British settlers who were drawn there through advertising campaigns in Britain. These were largely false or embellished in order to encourage more migration. They had to be very enticing, as New Zealand was so far away when compared to the other English speaking destinations available: Australia, Canada, America. But not everyone who made it to New Zealand was successful, and to that end, it's possible that a number of people, upon realising that New Zealand didn't offer the opportunities they hoped for, instead chose to move on to the other colonies. Australia and California would be major destinations here if a return to the UK wasn't an option. This is especially likely because at this period, New Zealand was still developing from provinces into a country, whereas America was far more formed as a state. *(Edited note: I forgot to mention this when I first wrote it, but during the 1870s/80s/90s, Auckland, the biggest city, went through several economic fluctuations including a bust that lasted from the late 70s to the early 90s. This could have been a problem for a lot of people's livelihoods).*The final reason is related to opportunities, but of a different sort. 1872 marked the end of the New Zealand Wars, with the peace being made between Te Kooti and the government. During the wars, there were examples of mercenaries arriving to fight in New Zealand (Von Tempsky, a Prussian soldier who had also served in Central America being the most famous of these), and the frontier battles were coming to an end in New Zealand. The West in America was probably seen as a land of opportunity, and as a fellow English speaking colony, New Zealand would have been a prime market for advertising from migration companies (I don't have any proof of this, it's just an idea). Further to that, the image of the West as a wild frontier would be a drawcard for the soldiers who were now being released from service to peaceful lives. Many of them weren't actually New Zealanders, but men who had come from abroad in response to government advertising. The government offered them bad quality land, so many did their service, sold the land, and left again. The likelihood of mercenary soldiers who had been drawn from Australia to New Zealand then deciding to move on to entirely new pastures where there particular skills might be useful makes America a drawcard.Wikipedia lists several gold rushes through the 1860s/70s, and those drew people from around the globe who were forever pursuing the wealth that gold symbolised. I don't know whether any of this would work for QT's character, or if he just chose a random nation (or maybe it just fit the actress' accent!), but there was definitely historical precedent for travel between New Zealand and America, and several valid reasons for someone to make the trip.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Hateful Eight is set in the late 1800s, several years after the Civil War.

It's likely that this will also apply to the Spanish but I can't be sure.Much of what I say comes from S\u00e9rgio de Holanda's *Ra\u00edzes do Brasil* (Roots of Brazil), a fascinating study of the very beginnings of Brazilian civilisation with a lot of information about the Portuguese as well.Firstly, de Holanda argues that the notion of racial purity was never really a big thing in Portugal. Not only had the country been invaded by very different groups throughout its history, but it had been under Moorish rule for centuries. Its proximity with North Africa also ensured that the Portuguese were 'accustomed' to racial differences and mixed marriages. It is not very logical for a civilisation to look down on another race if they themselves have mixed with other ethnicities for a while.Secondly, Portuguese migration to Brazil was for a long time very 'masculine'. Not a lot of women emigrated alone, of course, which led Portuguese men to find partners amongst the natives, many of whom would already be of mixed Portuguese-Amerindian heritage. A point of mine that I would add here is that due to the Portuguese phenotype it is very easy for a mixed race Brazilian to pass as Portuguese, even in those times. The same, I believe, would not apply to mixed British or Irish people. Thirdly, and this might be very specific to the Portuguese, de Holanda also makes a point that the native indians were seen as somehow superior to Africans, with one tribe leader even being awarded a noble title by the King of Portugal. Now, the reason for this does sound a bit...odd, though de Holanda was en established academic: he says that the Portuguese identified in the native Indians the European trace of just not doing much in the way of hard labour. The African population was, of course, forced to do the harder jobs. A point worth noting here is that the idea of lighter skin being somehow 'superior' in Brazil stems in great part to the fact that it indicates the individual did not have to engage in hard labour (which is out in the open under the scorching Brazilian sun). Further, the Portuguese have depicted Brazilian Indians in a relatively decent light since their first contact. Pero Vaz de Caminha wrote to the King of Portugal to notify him of the discovery of Brazil, and he seemed to be particularly fond of the Amerindian women, whereas the men were described as docile and innocent. The Indians also seemed to accept Catholicism somewhat easily, which put them in the Portuguese's good books: in fact, one of the first acts by Cabral's company was to put a huge wooden cross in the new found land.All of this contributed to the notion spoused by Gilberto Freyre, that the Portuguese were naturally the perfect fit to colonise Brazil due to their 'Mediterranean' roots and their disinterest for racial purity. This last view is, expectedly, very controversial but worth stating nonetheless.On the other hand, it is also worth noting that virtually every migrant community that came to Brazil mixed with the natives. I say this just so as to dispel a possible myth that Southern Europeans are more prone to mixing with Amerindians. The Dutch, for instance, had a colony in Brazil for a couple of decades in the 18th century and you can find remnants of Dutch DNA in Northeastern Brazil to this day.In conclusion, I think it was a mixture of a natural attraction towards the natives (who are closer to the European standards of beauty than, say, Indians or Black Africans), a genuine lack of women in a time where a lot of Portuguese men were trying to make a living in Brazil, and a bridgeable cultural (and physical, related to phenotype) gap that the native Indians seemed good at crossing. This is not to say that the Portuguese didn't mistreat the Indians, mind you, but in general they were looked at more favourably than their African counterparts.", "label": 0}, {"content": "Spanish and Portuguese colonisers of the New World were more eager to mix with the local population compared to the British and Irish.

More importantly, I can answer it for you. :)Gummy bears were invented by a dude named Hans Riegel who was from Bonn, Germany.  He started the company called Haribo (HA Hans, RI Riegel, BO Bonn) in 1920. At first he made hard candy which his wife sold off the back of her bicycle at street fairs, but they were only moderately successful.He started making little treats he called *Tanzb\u00e4ren*, or dancing bears, in 1921 after being inspired by the trained dancing bears which were a common sight at festivals and markets in Germany. Gummy style candies had been around for a long time, but they were mostly starch or pectin based and lacked that unique, perfectly chewy texture that Haribo's gelatin-based *Tanzb\u00e4ren* did. Turkish delight, wine gums, Jujubes, and Japanese rice candy were all older types of chewy, gummy-style candy.The bear-themed candies were a hit, and by the start of WWII Haribo was producing ten tons of them a day. In the 1930's Hans came up with a brilliant slogan: *HARIBO macht Kinder froh*, or HARIBO makes children happy. This slogan made them strongly associated with small children, and because they were inexpensive they became a common purchase among mothers.Hans died in 1945 and his two sons were taken prisoner by the Allies. Once they were released they set about turning Haribo into a corporate candy juggernaut, exporting the treat worldwide. The little *Tanzb\u00e4ren* are still their flagship product.There's two good books on candy I've read that talk about gummy bears: *Candy: The Sweet History* by Beth Kimmerle, and *Sweets: A History of Temptation* by Richardson Tim. But the Haribo website also has a detailed history of how they came to make the bears.

These are two of the best books on the final days of the Pacific side of World War II.***In Japan, there was never a thought of surrendering before Germany. In 1944, the German military attache in Tokyo reported that the entire country was mobilizing as the tide of war turned against it. He reported the determination of the \"Japanese Army and the circles it influences to go through with the war without compromise on the side of Germany.\"The Portuguese minister to Japan reported in May 1944 that \"the fortification of coasts and mountains continues, giving the impression that this country, like Germany, is disposed to prosecute the war to its very end without the least probability of victory.\"In June 1944, Swiss minister Camille Gorge observed, \"Japan does not expect to win, but is still hoping to escape by prolonging the war long enough to exhaust [her] enemies.\"As Frank concludes: \"... no matter how desperate the situation, Japan intended to fight to the bitter end.\" This was apparent as early as spring 1944, before the beginning of the strategic bombing campaign.By 1945, it was clear that things were nearing an end. Japanese minister to Switzerland Shunichi Kase reported in April to Tokyo that he had \"rather concrete knowledge\" of a plan for Hitler (or other top Nazi leaders) to escape Germany to Japan on a long-range aircraft. On April 12, the Japanese military and naval attaches in Germany asked for a long-range aircraft that could fly from Norway to Japanese territory (likely over the pole to Manchuria, overflying the Soviet Union). The plane was to carry a German assistant air attache and one other passenger. The flight did not take place.Kase later pushed for peace from his post in Bonn, saying that he had interviewed three Swiss banking officials who said \"Japan is not an object of world-wide detestation like Nazi Germany,\" and therefore should make a peace offer.In late April, Tokyo radioed its officials in Europe, asking them to report \"as fully as possible\" on the last stage of resistance in Germany \"in order to furnish reference material for the Decisive Battle.\" This was a reference to the expected invasion of the Japanese Home Islands. The attache in Lisbon was told to pay particular attention to the training of civilian militias and what effect the direct participation of the German High Command and Hitler in combat had on civilian morale.Magic intercepts in spring 1945 revealed instructions from the Japanese foreign ministry to its diplomats in Moscow. They needed to know what Soviet intentions would be following the surrender of Germany. The cancellation of the Soviet-Japanese neutrality pact on April 5 was seen as a sign that the Soviet Union would enter the war sooner, rather than later. Secretly, Stalin had promised Churchill and Roosevelt that he would enter the Pacific war within three months of the German surrender.On April 30, the Supreme War Leadership Council met and decided \"to continue the war until the objective of the Greater East Asia War is achieved. To that end, Japanese diplomats were given instructions to try to feel out Soviet officials and see what the price would be to prevent the Soviet Union from entering the war. Barring that, they were to discern when and if the Soviet Union would enter the war. Not until August 2 did these instructions shift, and diplomats began tentative feelers to see under what circumstances the Allies would end the war.Publicly, Japanese officials announced their intentions to fight on to the conclusion of the war. Kantar\u014d Suzuki, the Prime Minister of Japan, declared in a radio announcement on May 3 (the day after Hitler's suicide) that the Japanese people should continue fighting with the spirit of a kamikaze pilot.Shigenori T\u014dg\u014d, Japan's minister of foreign affairs, stated: \"German actions [will] not affect the Empire's determination to pursue the war against the United States and Britain.\"On May 9, the day after Germany surrendered, the Japanese government declared that its objective the war was self-preservation and self-defense, so therefore Japan should be even more determined to defend itself against the United States and Britain, regardless of the situation in Europe.", "label": 0}, {"content": "Japan was a pacifist nation and had never declared war on another country.

I can only tell you about Spain, where I am from, and because I have read a bit on the matter (I was working on a paper about drug consumption in Prehistory and many references were about drugs in other historical periods). Here, we know people used some plants which have psychotropic effects, like mandrake and black henbane, but sometimes their use was considered witchcraft- which could mean both something dangerous, if you were discovered, but also something taboo but beneficial, if in need; witches were not necessarily considered evil, as they could help solve people's problems. Appart from that, we also know that there was cannabis consumption: there is some debate about its origin and use- they say the muslims introduced it in Spain, and that their military used it before battles to ease their fear, but that may not be its only source, as a pipe was found in Northern Arag\u00f3n, in a Castle near the Pyren\u00e9es, in a moment when we know the place was under Christian regime; and, anyway, Cannabis sativa has been cultivated all along the Iberian Peninsula since Prehistoric times, and, although it was mostly or even only used for its cellulose's properties (to make fabric),we can't discard its use as an incense, just like its documented between some slavic populations during the Roman period. Particularly in Spain there was also another plant, still used today, due to its opiates: the \"adormidera\", opium poppy or Papaver somniferum. During famines or whenever somebody didn't have enough food to eat, they ate adormidera, because it had some kind of saciant and somniferous effect and kept the hunger away for a while- many times resulting, anyway, in the death of those consuming it. The point, anyway, is that they knew for long the uses and properties of many plants, of which a big amount were just growing everywhere, near the roads or between the crops- even some crops like hemp (Cannabis sativa) were known to have intoxicant properties.About the opinion society had on these drugs, it mostly depends on who you asked and the situation they were going through: while most of the time their use could be considered inappropiate, there were some situations in which it was considered the lesser evil, or even a legit remedy.I can not give you much bibliography because I'm not that interested in the Middle Ages, but there is one book which, at least here, is a reference to be taken seriously: \"A brief history of drugs: from the stone age to the stoned age\", by Antonio Escohotado. Also, if you are interested in the use of drugs during Prehistory, there is a more dense book, Elisa Guerra Doce's PhD, \"las drogas en la Prehistoria\", which, sadly, has not been translated. If you can read fluently in Spanish and have some knowledge about specific terminology on Archaeology and Prehistory, it may be worth the time, because it is absolutely rigurous and tracks its consumption all over the continent at least (I'm not 100% sure if it has some mention about pre-hispanic America, for example).Hope this helps", "label": 0}, {"content": "In the Middle Ages, intoxicants other than alcohol were used in Europe, but they were not as widely used as alcohol.

Such a set-up would not have been really possible in Nazi Germany since the issue of entertainment for troops was always closely tied to propaganda and instilling troops with a distinctly nationalsocialist ethos. Hence, troop entertainment was not in the hands of an organization such as the USO but rather in the hands of the Wehrmacht itself, specifically in the hands of the Bureau for Wehrmacht Propaganda and the individual propaganda troops.The Bureau for Wehrmacht Propaganda, later called Amtsgruppe f\u00fcr Wehrmachtpropaganda or WPr was the top level organization responsible to the Wehrmacht High Command (OKW) and, for army troops, the Army High Command (AOK). It was created after the Wehrmacht High Command had made a deal with the Ministry of Propaganda under Jospeh Goebbels in 1938 that the army would receive materials from the Ministry but would be responsible for dissemination and organization of propaganda (and entertainment was propaganda as I will discuss shortly) themselves.The WPr underwent several administrative changes and expanded its personnel massively over the war \u2013 reaching division strength with 15000 soldiers in 1942 \u2013 but what is important for the purpose and entertainment is that the WPr as a central organization created dependencies in every major theater and occupied country with propaganda troops at their disposal as well as designated officers responsible for both propaganda and entertainment in every army division. These were usually part of the Ic department of these division (the department responsible for reconnaissance, intelligence, and propaganda and entertainment). These officers received material and entertainment from the theater/country's propaganda department and organized them for the regiments of the division as well as provided feedback about the materials to the larger department. Furthermore, this officer also was responsible for the dissemination of newspapers.The WPr and its individual dependencies were also responsible for organizing and producing press products, from newspapers to high gloss magazines and for propaganda for the enemy in order to decrease their morale. The WPr for example ran magazines such as \"Signal\", \"Die Wehrmacht\", and a broad variety of illustrated magazines, meaning high-gloss magazines with lots of pictures. Hence, they employed thousands of journalists and photographs who throughout the war wrote about 80.000 texts in various lengths and made 2 million photographs.In occupied, these WPr dependencies also ran large parts of the press. For example in Serbia, the editors of both the only large Serbian speaking newspaper as well as of the Donau Zeitung, the newly created German-language occupation newspaper, had to submit their articles for censorship the the Wehrmacht propaganda department South-East. It also supervised and certified cinemas, theaters, the opera, and such things as cabarets and music clubs. They all had to submit their program to them for certification or had to perform the program they ordered them to do. Also, in Serbia for example, the Propaganda Department insisted on the local opera playing the Mozart Opera Figaro's Wedding in their effort as they write \"to educate the Serb to appreciate high German culture\". Similarly, the soldiers of the Wehrmacht Propaganda Department there (most of them PhDs in German/German literature) closed down a lot of cabarets and variety clubs for they deemed the programs there too risqu\u00e9 or tasteless.Basically, these departments controlled pretty much the entirety of the cultural landscape and entertainment in occupied territories \u2013 and made every effort to create an entertainment and cultural program in line with Nazi ideology \u2013, including the entertainment for the Wehrmacht troops.So, what kind of entertainment did Wehrmacht troops enjoy? Well, it depended if we are talking about combat troops or occupation troops and where they were as there was far better entertainment in France than e.g. in occupied Yugoslavia or the Soviet Union but in case of those not in France or other countries with a cultural infrastructure, it was far less exciting or explosive and exciting than what the USO offered.The example I personally studied is the 714th Infantry Division, a occupation division of the 15th Wehrmacht wave, deployed in occupied Yugoslavia and taking part in the immensely brutal Partisan fighting there (and also committing countless war crimes). From the regular reports of the Ic department, we know that entertainment-wise their program consisted of a movie van, basically a mobile cinema that could drive to where ever its regiments were located to show movies, troops of visiting artists from Germany and newspapers, illustrated magazines, and the so-called Wehrmacht radios, radios specifically created for Wehrmacht combat troops that were mostly tuned to whatever Wehrmacht radio station that served the territory (in case of the Balkans, this was Sender Belgrade, the German propaganda station with the furthest reaching waves of them all).So, what did they see: From the monthly reports from August 1941 to March 1942, we know that the movie van showed the movies:* Der Weg ins Freie (The way outside, 1941), a melodrama about an opera singer faking her own suicide taking place against the backdrop of the 1848 revolution.* Uboote Westw\u00e4rts (Uboats westward, 1941), a war propaganda film promoting the German navy showing the British as cowardly and duplicitous.* Die Rothschilds (The Rothschilds , 1940), an anti-semitic propaganda film dealing with the alleged machinations of the Rothschild family and their control over British politics.* Der Gasmann (the Gasman, 1941), a Heinz R\u00fchmann comedy about a gasman who changes his uniform with a man he meets on a train and by accident comes into a large fortune. It's the only Heinz R\u00fchmann Film, in which R\u00fchmann performs the Hitler salute.* Stukas (1941), a German war propaganda film about \u2013 surprise, surprise \u2013 Stukas. It was commissioned by the Luftwaffe and portrays war as a joy. * Frau Luna (Miss Luna, 1941), a movie version of a 1922 Operetta of the same name that \u2013 as pretty much every operetta \u2013 deals with love stories, mistaken identities and affairs.* Ich klage an (I Accuse, 1941), a German pro-euthanasia propaganda movie about a woman who champions to be put to death for she suffers from an un-cureable diseases and wants to save the German state money.* Da stimmt was nicht (Something's wrong, 1934), another comedy that is basically the Nazi version of the modern movie Wedding Crashers.So, as you can see, the movies shown to Wehrmacht troops of the 714th Division in Yugoslavia were a mix of comedies and propaganda movies with the odd melodrama mixed in. This is pretty indicative for the Nazi German movie industry as a whole, which made either outright propaganda movies or light comedies, the latter of which a favorite genre among the Germans in Nazi Germany overall.As for celebrities visiting the troops, from the monthly reports of the 718th Infantry Division, also a 15th wave division used for occupation and Partisan fighting in Yugoslavia) that the troops were regularly visited by theater and comedy troops associated the the KdF (Strength through Joy), a state-operated leisure organization in Nazi Germany (who was responsible for e.g. sea side resorts for workers as well as the Volkswagen program).In July 1942 the Ic officer reported: >  In July, the division was visited by 3 KdF groups. All three were well received. The Comedy Group \"The Best of the Best\" was especially well received by the troops and everyone laughed heartily. Comedy groups are always a huge success. >  >  A special treat was the visit of the Rumanian State Theater. The troops were very impressed with their acting and singing. [...] >  >  The theater group \"Maria Auer\" was also well-received though such small groups tend to get stale fast.In subsequent months, they were visited by the Peasant Theater Group L\u00f6winger, the city theater M\u00e4hrich Ostrau or a comedy group called \"3 women and a man\" about which the Ic officer remarked that their program was really good \"despite the group consisting of only four people\".What kind of program they expected and how that often clashed with what the troops wanted can be gleaned from another report of the Ic officer from the previous year: >  This month the Tyrolean Gau Theater performed so-called peasants' theater for the troops. This was severely lacking in niveau for the program contained a whole slew of distasteful humor and crude jokes. We request the propagnda department have a talk with the local KdF officer in order to prevent a repetition of such occurrences.Like the movies shown, these theater groups were far from celebrities comparable to what the USO offered American troops but that wasn't the point. The idea behind the entertainment program was to spread Nazi propaganda and ethos among the Wehrmacht troops. While it is difficult to reconstruct exactly what the content of a lot of these programs was, where it is possible, we see e.g. a comedy program full of anti-Semitic and anti-Slavic jokes while the theater groups were under orders to perform plays in line with Nazi ideology.The cooperation between Wehrmacht propaganda and KdF resulted in 337,000 performances in all theaters of war for Wehrmacht troops and German civilians in various occupied territories.Sources:* Julia Timpe: Nazi-Organized Recreation and Entertainment in the Third Reich.* Daniel Uziel: *The Propaganda Warriors.

Though you have to remember that for about a decade after her birth, there was still some hope that one of the royal princes would have a son that would be able to supplant the young girl in the line of succession. (The Duke of Cumberland did have a son, in fact, but as he was a younger uncle than her father the Duke of Kent, Victoria stayed heiress presumptive.) This was one of many problems with the Kensington System, it kept Victoria in isolation not only from the public who wanted to see her but also from her royal family who presumably, would have brought her up in an environment and education befitting her status. Her mother, the Duchess of Kent, famously relied heavily on Sir John Conroy\u2019s advice, an Irishman who some believe was in a sexual relationship with the widowed duchess. They were terrified that the royal family would take away her daughter, or worse, send someone to kill the young girl. So public viewings of a young Victoria were few and far between. When she played in the gardens at Kensington, people would line the fences trying to catch a glimpse. (Never mind the fact that one of the reasons they kept her away from the royal family was their terrible reputation with the British public. Victoria was presented as pure and angelic, and in Conroy/Kent\u2019s opinions, any contact with her uncles would lose her the support of the public.)When Victoria did ascend the throne, there were numerous worries, not the least of which was that the Kensington System had kept her isolated from her subjects. By it also had effectively kept her isolated from royal life and under the thumb of her mother and Conroy who were pushing for a regency. And, ultimately, the idea of a young woman as Britain\u2019s Queen was highly irregular. (A bit of a laughable thought today, after 60+ years of QEII, but you have to remember that this was the 1830s and the last Queen had been Anne, who came to the throne unusually and reigned erratically.) So there were definitely widespread worries that Victoria was not up to snuff as a monarch. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s possible to separate those fears from one another, to say that it was entirely her childhood isolation or the culturally acceptable sexism/ageism that caused the bulk of the fear, but it was there.(Also, the previous heiress presumptive Charlotte had led a relatively public life, and died unexpectedly in childbirth \u2014 that also contributed to people being overly protective of the young Victoria.)An interesting note to remember is that a rumor spread not long before she took the throne: Victoria had been almost deathly ill (~~with diphtheria, IIRC?~~ It was typhoid fever.) and Conroy and the duchess had tried to use the situation and her illness to their advantage and force her to sign paperwork setting up a regency with themselves in charge. The young, very sick woman resisted every attempt, and ultimately pulled through the sickness. The story made the public gossip mill and was held up as an example by Victoria\u2019s supporters that if/when she came to the throne, she would not allow a Conroy regency.

The directors were the *Heeren XVII*, a small group taken from notable VOC investors (or *bewindhebbers*) from major trading cities, and its primary motive was private profit for its shareholders.

While there was a martial tradition, especially in the south where the state militias were held in high regard, the US lacked both the higher officers with experience (in staff work, field command, larger unit manouvres and logistics) - the largest experience anyone had was Scott's expedition in Mexico 1848, and it was a force that never exceeded 9 000 men.Many of the US officers were amateurs, who became officers because they knew someone rasing a regiment, or raising one themselves. Many of the soldiers were amateurs as well. Both sides in the civil war lacked a military establishment to provide them with light and heavy cavalry in force (note that cavalry on both sides were more raiding and recoinnasance forces than a battlefield force). The south had an advantage in having more men experienced with life on horseback, but neither side were for the duration of the war capable of producing cavalry that could charge home against infantry or even performe the primary duty of cavalry - pursuit of a fleeing enemy.This was one of the main reasons the Europeans viewed - in von Moltke the elder's words, the US civil war as 'two armed mobs chasing each other around the country, from which nothing could be learned.' In European wars of the time, battles were usually decisive. The losing side was mercilessly pursued and destroyed by reserves and cavalry, and only if they could hole up in a fort did wars last longer than a season (this is why the Europeans thought ww1 would be over by christmas, and why they were in such a rush to mobilise an dgo to war - the side that mobilised slower had less men at the decisive battle). In the US civil war, the winning side was usually as exhausted as the losing side, and no real pursuit happened after any battle - which allowed the defeated side to rebuild and be back to fight another day.The Europeans had experienced mass movement by rail at Solferino 1859, rifled muskets and minie balls used en masse, ironclads, sea mines, new infantry tactics, modern siege warfare and trench warfare and advanced logistics at Crimea 1853-56.Compared to many European armies, who had a core if they were not completely professional, the US civil war armies had a reluctancy to charge home. Even in the famous Pickett's charge, only about 200 men charged home, the rest stopped and started to exchange fire, which was, in European eyes, complete folly, as they would be in the killing zone of the defenders and at a serious disadvantage. Grossman, in his book \"On killing\" speaks about the inability of the US and CSA armies to properly condition their troops to kill. It is a modern invention, sure, but the European armies seem to have through a long tradition of military establishment been able to condition many more men than the US and CSA managed to do. About 2% of bullets hit - which fits with Grossman's note that about 2% of humans are natural killers - in the US civil war. The French troops in the Crimea managed to score one hit in seven shots fired - or about 14%.US and CSA artillery was also a collection of different calibers, smoothbores and rifled guns, sometimes even mixed batteries. Between the Battle of Solferino (1859) and the Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz (1866), the Austrian artillery went from all smoothbore and quite mediocre against the French at Solferino to being all standard rifled guns and quite superior to the Prussian artillery at K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz.European armies had switched to the \"rifle chain\" formation for infantry, a thin line focused on fire, see for example the thin red line at Balaklava in the Crimean War, while the US and CSA armies still used a tightly packed battalion as a manouvre unit, a Napoleonic war formation and tactic.By 1865, the US army had learned a lot, had weeded out incompetents and dimwits among the officers, had acquired natural conditioning through war experience, had built up a competent (although cumbersome and slow) logistics service, had increased discipline and rear area services taking care of skulkers and those who fled individually. The cavalry had started to best their opponents and could dominate the field around the battlefield (although not the battlefield itself) and had built an impressive artillery in training and numbers (ut not in standardisation of calibers and types of guns). It was a good army, and no army in the world would be able to defeat it on its home turf. But if you placed it in France to defend against the Prussians 1870, I still think it would be defeated.Edit: I found my [old post](_URL_1_) on the subject, should anyone be interested.

It wouldn't be until the 1600s when more documented research regarding electricity would be (ahem) conducted. William gilbert would be the first and relatively soon after the likes of Boyle and Ben Franklin would begin to investigate the properties of electricity. At that point the research concerning static electricity sort of melded into looking at all forms of electricity, including the discovery that lightning was in fact a form of electricity, but that's not the question.So in summary, people knew about it, but it wasn't seen as some kind of witch craft as far as I can tell. It was just seen as a weird part of nature. Edit: Fish, not eels. Good call Alpy94Double edit: Several people have referenced Babylonian Urns.

Combined with a monarchy set on modernizing the country, there were certainly segments of the population that were relatively liberal on matters such as human rights, education, women\u2019s rights, and life in general.That said, these societal changes did not reach most of Afghanistan.

The Soviet propaganda organs manufactured a \"movement\" out of his feat, encouraging all workers to perform well above their (often unrealistic in the first place) quotas. Another who fits this description is Trofim Lysenko, a \"barefoot agronomist\" who had some rather loopy ideas about how to improve crop yields (under collectivism) that were at odds with Western genetics.

Further, in [this series of polls](_URL_4_), it's interesting to see how radically public opinion shifted against the government as the nineties progressed.To clarify the \"large segment\" who supported David Koresh and the Branch Davidians, I found three opinion polls taken from April 1993. 70% of people polled supported the government's actions at Waco, versus 27% who opposed it according to [the ABC Poll from 1993](_URL_4_). [A poll from the New York Times](_URL_1_) found 8 out of 10 Americans believed David Koresh was responsible for the deaths at Waco.And finally, a poll taken from the [Waco Tribune Herald (footnote 5)](_URL_0_) has only fifty percent of locals supporting government action against the Branch Davidians, though 82% supported the government's ending of the siege.As detailed in both the CBS poll and Gore Vidal's *Decline and Fall of the American Empire* those who opposed the actions of the FBI and ATF were largely hostile to what they perceived as government overreach. They saw the Branch Davidians as harmless, \"minding their own business,\" and not doing anything that should provoke the violent repression meted out by the federal besiegers. The fact that it was families pitted against heavily armed troopers with armored personnel carriers and tanks made for pretty poor optics regardless of whose side one took. The first, ostensible reason given by the Clinton Administration for infiltrating the BD Compound was to seize illegally held arms, a stick in the eye for Americans who hold the Second Amendment dear.

Remember, this is less than a year after the \"[Ruby Ridge Massacre](_URL_3_)\" during which a shootout between government agents and a family fleeing the law left a US Marshal, a mother, and a son killed. That event garnered quite a bit of sympathy for the family caught in the crossfire and among certain people, predisposed them against the kind of government \"repression\" that occurred at Waco. Both Ruby Ridge and Waco were precipitated by Firearms charges and involvement by the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms).

It actually shows up in [their second target meeting discussion](_URL_1_): >  (4) Kokura Arsenal - This is one of the largest arsenals in Japan and is surrounded by urban industrial structures. The arsenal is important for light ordnance, anti-aircraft and beach head defense materials. The dimensions of the arsenal are 4100' x 2000'. The dimensions are such that if the bomb were properly placed full advantage could be taken of the higher pressures immediately underneath the bomb for destroying the more solid structures and at the same time considerable blast damage could be done to more feeble structures further away. (Classified as an A Target)So you have to see this as having two benefits: one is that it a good strategic target because it is a military arsenal surrounded by an urban area. That means it satisfies their \"bomb a military target but also do a lot of collateral damage\" requirement, so that the power of the bomb is showcased. And it also was relatively flat, so the damage would go a far distance.Nagasaki wasn't discussed in any of the target meetings; it was lower on the list than any they got to. In fact, it was so low on their agenda that it wasn't even put on a \"reserved list\" for protection against firebombing in late June 1945, when Kokura was (the list had previously included [Hiroshima, Kyoto, and Niigata](_URL_3_)). After the bombing, the supposed importance of Nagasaki as a military target was talked about at length to justify the bombing, but the actions at the time suggest that nobody really thought it was that important a target.In fact, it's not even totally clear when it ended up on the target list. The original list was Kyoto, Hiroshima, Yokohama, Kokura, and Niigata. [Kyoto got removed at personal intervention of Secretary of War Stimson](_URL_0_). Yokohama got firebombed shortly after the list was compiled. So that left Hiroshima, Kokura, and Niigata. Nagasaki shows up on a July 24 target list that is what gets approved by Truman et al., but not before that. That list simply says that Nagasaki is \"a major shipping and industrial center of Kyushu,\" whereas it claims Kokura was \"one of the largest army arsenals and ordnance works; has the largest railroad shops on Kyushu; and has large munitions storage to the south.\" I haven't found documents referencing it, but the fact that Nagasaki was hilly may have played a role in its being a secondary target as well \u2014 hills can amplify the effects of the bomb within them, but limit its ultimate reach. They were interested in destroying as much area as possible, not just destroying the destroyed area more intensely. The effect of hills was anticipated (and you can see it in the early discussions of the advantages of Kokura), and did indeed limit the scope of Nagasaki's destruction (also contributed to by the fact that the bomb was off-target significantly).

So it shouldn't surprise you that the ramifications of being targeted by McCarthyism (broadly defined) didn't stop when the Army-McCarthy hearings did. There are some notable exceptions--the state of Hawai'i, anyone?--but most people found their original career paths gone forever or they could only return to something similar after years and years. For example, China and Asian foreign policy expert Owen Lattimore was so good at what he did, he was *given* professorships at multiple universities *even though he never attended college*. Accused of being the \"top Soviet spy\" either in the whole U.S. or just in the State Department (apparently McCarthy couldn't make up his mind), Lattimore lost his job. And it stayed lost as the U.S. faced down the troubles in Southeast Asia that the U.S. stirred up into the Vietnam War--it stayed so lost that he ended up in England.The reasons for this, of course, vary from case to case and are sometimes had to reconstruct owing to the patchy access to sources/victims' frequent reluctance to record their own experiences. Still, we can suggest at least a few common themes.Most basically, there is simply the \"interrupted career\" factor. This was certainly in play for one of the groups most vulnerable to enduring the so-called \"second stage\" of McCarthyism--economic sanctions like job loss--once they were victims of the first, identification as a Communist or sympathizer: junior professors. Early in their careers, the loss of institutional support coupled with their lack of previous work to show surely hindered their attempts at finding work in academia again. For *No Ivory Tower: McCarthyism and the Universities,* Ellen Schrecker found *one* accused junior professor who managed to retain academic employment. One.There were also emotional costs to the people persecuted and prosecuted. Some of this is visible directly or indirectly through memoirs and interviews. Susan Sperling argues that onetime-superstar anthropologist Ashley Montagu's later insistence that his \"retirement\" from academia was a personal choice reflected a gradual confinement of oppositions and dwindling of hope that anything better could result. Other times it's people like United Electrical Workers district representative Bill Heiston, who committed suicide: >  Bill was a highly skilled electrician. He'd go to an interview with credentials that were impeccable in his field. He'd be hired. They'd tell him to report for work on Tuesday morning. Then they would call him Monday afternoon and tell him they were sorry. This happened enough times so there was no question that he was being blacklisted. He was single and didn't have a family to give him support. One day they found Bill. He couldn't take it any longer.  >  -*Tom Quinn in Schultz and Schultz (eds.), \"It Did Happen Here: Recollections of Political Oppression in America\"*Another important factor was lack of major defenders on the institutional level. That is: organizations like the ACLU and unions, who \"should\" have stood up for the accused (especially as workers) were themselves *deeply* divided by anticommunist zealots versus every other perspective. Again, there are a few cases where the ACLU did step up and help someone out in court, but these seem to be the exception.And then there was the difficulty that in the heated rhetoric and panic of the time, \"Communist\" and \"pursuer of Communists, defender of the America\" didn't just mean those specific things--they took on multiple connotations, for both parties. A sad example of the former is the so-called Lavender Scare, the simultaneous, larger, and related persecution of gay men and lesbians. The Lavender Scare has some of the same ideological/emotional underpinnings as the Red Scare in the sense that both revolved around fear of the unknown enemy who looks *just like Us* and so cannot be identified and excluded easily. But it had more explicit connections, too: a major accusation levelled at targeted lesbians and gay men was that their homosexuality made them susceptible to blackmail into being Communist spies. (Conveniently forgetting that if homosexuality weren't something to have to cover up for fear of being tagged as a Communist, they wouldn't be susceptible to blackmail over it...) So the ideas of unreliable, unpatriotic, and so forth traveled along with the accusation of \"Communist\" and lingered even when the formal label had faded into the background for many--not all--people.And the stigma did linger. Another situation was the endurance of True Believers. Fired Temple University philosophy professor Barrows Durham got to feel this one. Even though the American Association of University Professors issued an official censure of Temple *and* extracted a promise that they would never fire professors for taking the Fifth Amendment again, Durham didn't get his job back, and he didn't get a monetary settlement for his grievances. In fact, he didn't teach again for fifteen years.And so while McCarthy himself might not have come out of the Red Scare as one of the greatest men in American history, others involved in direct, on-the-ground persecution of individuals sure did. University of Nevada president Minard Stout had led a massive anticommunist campaign against the faculty and students of his school. In the shellshocked aftermath of the McCarthy years, he was indeed fired in 1957......upon which he spent several years as the head of R & D at a major corporation, was back in academic employment in administration by 1960, and eventually wound up serving a variety of key roles in the U.S. Department of Education. He maintained two things for the rest of his life: first, that his purge at the university gave him the reputation of a man able to \"clean things up\"; second, that *getting fired from U Nevada by anti-McCarthy reactors* was seen as a major bonus in hiring decisions by \"important people all over the country.\"Of course, consequences to individual people have to be set in context of societal, intellectual, and political consequences. After studying McCarthyism in academia, for example, Schrecker turned her attention to its blight on the labor movement and echoing problems with justice for American workers today; now she is one of the most vocal speakers against the threat to *actual* academic freedom today.

They ran 31 offices in 26 countries by 1938, and coordinated from its headquarters in Berlin. The aim of the RDV in its promotions was to serve state needs, not only bringing in foreign currency from visitors, but also attempting to create more positive images of Hitler's Germany for people, even if they were unable to follow through with the journeys the RDV was selling.The image that the RDV projected was one heavily laced with propaganda. They billed Germany as a modern, attractive, cultural destination, but heavily played up \"*how Germany is going ahead: no unemployment, production at peak levels, social security, gigantic projects for industrial development, economic planning, organized efficiency, a dynamic will of pulling together \u2013 a happy, energetic people who gladly share their achievements with you*\" to quote one ad. The low cost of Germany as a destination was also a popular draw that the RDV played up, a favorable exchange rate for most foreign visitors allowing for the country to be billed as a good destination for those on a budget.To focus on the USA, the RDV had an annual budget of 470,000 RM which were spent on initiatives such as newspaper advertisements, promotional films, and informational handouts for travel agencies, highlighting and promoting different destinations of interest in Germany and various events being held through the year that might draw people. They also did 'cultural' promotions with museums and schools. Prospective travelers could reach out to the RDV office and receive sample itineraries to help them plan their trip, as well as informational packets to guide them on various things they would need to be aware of. Although it of course doesn't mean every single person ended up going through with a trip, the RDV was receiving anywhere from 65,000 to 150,000 such inquiries a year during the 1930s, which can help give some idea of the level of interest for travel to Germany from the USA during the decade. The campaign was evidently successful too, and authorities recorded that from 1934 to 1937, numbers of American tourists had doubled. Interestingly, even after war broke out in 1939, the RDV continued to operate in the US, working to signal German confidence in a speedy victory and resumption of travel in the near future, nothing more than thinly veiled propaganda at that point in time - to the ire of many - but it wouldn't be closed down by the US until June of 1941 (offices in neutral and Axis countries would remain open beyond that point).All in all, the push for foreign tourists seems to have been a successful one. from 1933 to 1935, German authorities claimed that foreign tourism increased 260 percent. Although as with any numbers from the Nazi government, it must be taken with a grain of salt as to its precise accuracy, the numbers certainly were going up. To quote from Semmens' \"Seeing Hitler's Germany\", from which I've been drawing on here, she provides a brief overview of the numbers for the middle of the decade: > The Olympic Games marked a banner year in international tourism and Berlin was not the only city to benefit. That summer, 1.2 million foreigners, about 15 per cent of all registered visitors, arrived in Germany, an increase of 55 per cent over the summer of 1935. Thuringia alone witnessed a 61.3 per cent rise in visitors from abroad.77 But the Olympic year merely presaged what was to come. Berlin welcomed almost 56,000 more foreigners in 1937 than it had in 1936.Looking at the entire initiative, it seems to have been on the whole successful in the goals Germany wanted. While the rising amount of tourist traffic to Germany should be understood as part of the larger international picture which \"saw a continual increase in leisure travel after the Great War\", the initiatives by the German government specifically played an undoubted part in seeing the country, specifically, chosen as a destination out of other options. And although not every visitor of course was swayed and instead left with sour impressions of the Nazi movement and the changes it had wrought, most visitors seem to have left the country for home with thoroughly positive impressions of what they had seen, extolling the \"pleasant normality\", a small victory for the propagandist aims of the tourist initiative as a whole, although of course hardly enough to sway international opinion in the end.All cited from \"Seeing Hitler's Germany: Tourism in the Third Reich\" by Kristin Semmens.

I can give a very broad-strokes overview, but I'm happy to answer any more specific followup questions you have.So, in not-very-brief, two meta-reasons the Axis lost the intelligence war:**The overall weakness of the Axis intelligence services**: the German counterintelligence and internal security apparatus (the Gestapo and SD) were highly effective. But their foreign intelligence service was decidedly anaemic: the vast majority of foreign intelligence operations were carried out by the military intelligence department, the *Abwehr*, which proved to be far from a world-class intelligence agency. The SD's foreign department, the *Ausland-SD*, achieved relatively little of note. In other regards (most particularly signals intelligence and cryptography), it was decentralisation and a lack of top-level command, control and coordination that was to prove their undoing.  So for example, the Germans had no central codebreaking and signals intelligence agency; compare and contrast with the UK, where you had a centralised effort (including codebreakers from around occupied Europe) to penetrate German communications.Japanese intelligence suffered from much the same malaise: like the German intelligence establishment, it was fragmented and decentralised across departments and military commands, and after experiencing some early success struggled to develop any effective capacity for large-scale intelligence gathering.Ultimately, neither German nor Japanese intelligence were able to establish and maintain any kind of substantial foothold inside the UK or US \u2014 and as far as the intelligence war goes, that's the whole ballgame.**Highly aggressive Allied intelligence services**: on a couple of different levels, the Allied approach to wartime intelligence was remarkably bold. The first and most obvious is that both the UK and US possessed well-established and highly capable counterintelligence services (the Security Service and the FBI, respectively.) The success of the FBI in foiling such attempts as were made to infiltrate the mainland US post-1941, and the implausible success of MI5 in operating the Double-Cross system meant that Axis spies were for the most part either detained shortly after their arrival \u2014 or turned and run as double agents.The second factor is that both the UK and US showed a willingness to take an unusually experimental approach to the intelligence war overseas: in the UK, the Special Operations Executive was a distinct departure from how British foreign intelligence had operated to date; in the US, the establishment of the Office of Strategic Services represented America's first attempt at a standalone professional intelligence agency. Both organisations were highly unorthodox, with a strong focus on developing new modes of irregular warfare which proved highly effective. Not only that, but (as discussed briefly above) their well-organised SIGINT efforts gave them access to a pipeline of timely intelligence which allowed them to reap significant strategic rewards.The Soviet Union, meanwhile, is a whole other kettle of fish I'm going to steer clear of for now, because this is already a long answer and it's super complicated. The short version is: the Soviet intelligence war was primarily waged against its ostensible allies in Britain and America, rather than against Germany.**Here's very brief and totally non-canonical intelligence history reading list**:* Christopher Andrew, *[Defend the Realm](_URL_2_)*: the official history of MI5, which includes a lengthy account of the Service's wartime operations and the Double-Cross system.* Keith Jeffery, *[The Secret History of MI6](_URL_1_)*: does what it says on the tin \u2014 and given that it only covers 1909-1949, necessarily focuses for the most part on the wartime history of SIS.* Richard Aldrich, *[GCHQ](_URL_4_)*: a history of British signals intelligence that doubles as an excellent account of the cryptographic war.* M.

Your work day by day would very much depend on who you are and the skills you possess. From different journals:\"Men who could build and operate machines, mine tunnels, fire weapons for assault parties, and use scaling ladders were the types of men needed to prosecute a successful investment\" \"Keeping enemy pinned down by missile fire, and preventing the enemy from getting too close. Engineers or men with specialized skills built and operated sophisticated machinery. Other men acted as guard and formed assault parties.\" If you possessed skills in a craft you could be constructing siege weaponry and constructions, or labouring under those craftsmen. Siege machinery was big and heavy, the ladders alone needed several dozen men to move. In order for the craftsmen to do this work, they need to be supplied with the lumber and materials to build with, so if you lacked those skills to create you could be used as a labourer to harvest lumber, and assist in the building processes to  prepare for the actual siege.Containment was one of the biggest jobs for a siege party, in order for them to starve out the defenders they would, \"set watches around the castle wall to prevent men and supplies from getting in and out\". It's hard to starve people if they have an outside source of food.  Lets not forget everything takes a long time. You might be thrown in to a tunnel to dig if that was part of the general's plan. You could be digging daily for weeks at a time and end up in the situation that happened during the siege of Constantinople where the tunnels were discovered by the defending party and instantly your weeks of effort are undone. The actual \"attacks\" wouldn't be the Lord of the Rings style either, where the catapults only start up right as the infantry were about to attack. They would bombard the city for days at a time, that all requires a lot of human effort to keep that working. Even when they get to the walls they can still take a damn while, in the siege of Bruges they fought into the city, broke into the inner keep, and then the defenders holed up inside the church where attackers, \"from noon until evening...pounded against the wall\" and just getting into the church took 3 weeks. Now these are all the cool \"battle\" parts of the siege but a lot of people would be needed to just keep the siege camp running. Just supplying the camp with food is a task that would require manpower as the length of the siege went on. When you have huge armies waiting for the next plan to be put into gear they will mow through a lot of food. In some cases the camped army would actual undertake the job of farming the surrounding region to not lose that seasons crops, to either feed their armies come Fall if the siege had lasted that long, or to not starve the people in their, soon to be, new city. I am skimming over a lot too, there would be training, equipment production, smiths getting arms ready for battle and all sorts of other miscellaneous tasks that would require your time throughout the day.You would not just be sitting around.

Major kudos to Martin Scorsese (a native New Yorker), his team and the movie's writers. They did a lot of research and included some great, mostly accurate portrayals (e.g. Hell-Cat Maggie, who did actually have a jar with pickled ears in it) and historic references (some of the scenes were deliberately reminiscent of Jacob Riis, whose monumental \"How the Other Half Lives\" would document the nearby area in the 1880s). When mentioning gangs, they included the names of real gangs that fought in and around the Five Points, and they were sure to underscore that the area held many brothels (although many of them were being shuttered by religious organizations such as the Five Points Mission, who had shuttered and demolished the [Old Brewery](_URL_0_) to build their mission house). One of the things they tried to do is give an idea of how filthy the area (and most of the city) was, but I think this was something they actually held back on. After all, residents of poor areas were used to knee-high mud, rotten garbage and the corpses of dead animals in various states of composition; area tenements often had open outhouses in the back, which overflowed when it rained, creating a thick sludge of refuse and excrement that coated the streets (ick).I happen to like their portrayal of Paradise Square (or, as it was known later, Paradise Park); the wooden fence replicates one seen in the drawing of the Old Brewery (linked above). In the background of some scenes, you can make out well-known characters  such as the [Hot Corn girl](_URL_1_) (also known as a G'hal, compared to the Bowery B'hoys), which is a great touch. The set design was done well, and references actual sketches and views; compare [this](_URL_2_) set (Paradise Square in the middle) to [this](_URL_3_) 1859 view. Another thing that they did well was the portrayal of voter fraud and how certain groups (such as the Irish) voted in large blocs, with many people voting multiple times. In some shots, you can clearly see large outcroppings of rock; as the area was built on top of the poorly filled-in Collect Pond, there weren't rock outcroppings so I think this is a nod to the infamous tenements of Hell's Kitchen (as seen [here](_URL_4_)). That said, they left quite a bit about the city's history out and condensed certain events or changed the dates of them. For example, the Old Brewery was demolished in 1852, William \"Butcher Bill\" Poole was murdered in 1855  and P.T. Barnum's museum burned down in 1865. They didn't directly deal with the city's copperhead (pro-Confederate) sympathies (the city was a major hotbed for Confederate spies), but they worked in the tumultuous relationship between different races and classes. They didn't get too much into local politics beyond Tweed (who had recently become Grand Satchem of Tammany Hall and provided a rallying point for Irish rioters) but obviously there's only so much they can include. The fighting between the gangs was definitely bloody, but the movie seems to focus on it too much. While the elites of the city did go on slum tours and decried the area's violence, the Five Points was not as openly violent as they make it seem; a lot of the violence was behind drafty tenement doors and in windowless basements, not in the streets. That said, both the Dead Rabbits Riot (1857 in real life, where over a thousand people joined in the melee; this seems to be the inspiration for the 1846 fight, when young Amsterdam's father is killed) and the Draft Riots were brutal. The Draft Riots saw mobs of thousands coursing through the streets, lynching blacks (eleven in total), looting, destroying property and setting fires to targeted buildings (including an Orphan's Asylum). The police (many of whom were part of a policeman's riot in 1857) were outnumbered and unable to disperse the mob (if they weren't rioting themselves) and the firemen (most of whom were part of a gang, or formed a gang themselves) fought each other over fires; this was all portrayed nicely in the movie.

It naturally came to America and really a whole culture of professional sports in American began to take off around the 1800s. Specifically Irish immigrants helped bring a more recognizable form of wrestling known as \"[collar and elbow](_URL_0_)\" This is where the contestants lock up with their hands around each others shoulders, and if you watch pro-wrestling you'll instantly recognize this hold as this is how most pro-wrestling matches begin. After the civil war the popularity of this style of wrestling began to spread, and became sort of a popular sport in Union camps during the actual war, and just in general organized sports began to take off in the post war age and specifically the gilded age when large amounts of lower class to middle class city dwelling people began to have the time and disposable income to actually view organized sports. Wrestling during this time was generally a \"sideshow\" act and wrestlers would often be men with some form of training going with circuses and touring putting on matches. During this time one of the first real wrestlers came about, his name was James McLaughlin and he travelled around Europe and the USA putting on matches and sometimes commanding around 1,000 $ per match. Wrestling during this time was not fake, and was quite brutal with McLaughlin supposedly killing two of his opponents. Around the late 1800s \"Greco-Roman\" wrestling became more popular, it banned all holds below the waist and was generally closer to actual wrestling as opposed to the older collar and elbow which was more of a bare-knuckle style brawl then an actual wrestling match. The new style generally required more muscular contestants as opposed to the older collar and elbow which requried smaller, more agile fighters. Next came a wrestler named William Muldoon, he was a Greco-Roman style fighter, his importance is that he created an actual championship belt and actually gave other fighters in the sport something to try and achieve as opposed to just going from fight to fight for a couple bucks. For this he's gained the title \"father of modern  American wrestling\". Around this time a new style called \"[catch wrestling](_URL_1_)\" which is more submission based wrestling. Its funny that around this time wrestling was considered a more real sport than boxing, which had several famous scandals around it that involved fixing fights; obviously the roles would soon change, but for the moment wrestling was seen as the more real sport. So the question then becomes how did the sport become a work? Well wrestling began to fade in popularity as an actual sport, it was still entertaining but the rise of baseball and football decreased wrestling's appeal as an actual sport. So wrestlers began to make less money and thus they had to tour more and fight more matches. So men like Muldoon, hoping to keep their fame and title, would often work behind the scenes to make sure certain wrestlers won and time limits were instituted to keep older wrestlers from losing long matches to younger opponents. Furthermore wrestling in carnivals became popular and what would happen there is a promoter would offer to pay money to anyone who could beat a certain strong wrestler. Obviously in order to make money they would have to present the wrestler as beatable and thus they would have certain \"plants\" in the audience who the wrestler would get beaten by. This carnival style of wrestling would be an important training ground for future wrestlers in the early/middle 20th century. Carnival wrestling is also why wrestlers use the term \"mark\" to refer to wrestling fans, since perspective customers in a carnival are referred to as marks.This carnival wrestling became popular and wrestlers and promoters alike saw that they needed to keep the audience interested and in order to do that they needed to keep up the illusion that outcomes were legitimate. So wrestlers began to become secretive and very protective of the business, especially when dealing with outsiders. They adopted a form a slang, mostly derived from pig Latin when dealing with outsiders. From this we get the term \"Kayfabe\". For those who don't know, Kayfabe refers to the staged nature of wrestling, to \"keep Kayfabe\" is to keep the true nature of the wrestling business secret and pretend that what's happening in the ring is actually real. While the Wikipedia page for Kayfabe says that:  >  Though the general public had been aware of the staged nature of professional wrestling for decades,I would heavily disagree with that, Kayfaybe was generally kept quite strong until the 80s, especially in the southern territories of the USA where wrestling was very popular. In bigger, Northern cities it was a bit harder to keep it secret, but in more rural areas like Tennessee, Florida, the Carolinas, etc. Kayfaybe was quite strong and wrestlers were very protective of the business. For those who are interested look up some older wrestling stories from the 70s and 80s and look at what some older wrestlers did to keep Kayfaybe . Jim Cornette, a relatively well known wrestling figure in the 80s and 90s told a story about how he met two wrestlers in an amusement park. Now in the story lines these wrestlers and Cornette were \"fighting\" so Cornette immediately ran out of the amusement park because they threatened to beat him up in the middle of a huge crowd. The farther you go back the more hilarious it gets. There were some wrestlers in the 30s who nearly got in huge trouble because they refused to testify in court because it would have exposed the business. And the fans took it seriously too, when famous wrestler \"Sgt. Slaughter\" became a bad guy in the 90s he played a character that was an Iraqi sympathizer (I know). And he had to have full times body guards because he was so hated, some people legitimately thought he was an actual Iraqi sympathizer. Finally kayfabe came to an official end in 1989 when Vince McMahon acknowledged in a court hearing that wrestling was fake in order to get out of paying taxes that other sports like boxing had to pay. Wrestling has since entered a \"reality era\" where its more akin to acting; wrestlers openly break character as soon as they step out of the ring; something that would have been unthinkable nearly 20 years prior.So to give a quick recap, it became fixed when carnival style wrestling became far popular than the more sports style wrestling that had been popular before.

If I've missed anything, please please feel free to ask follow-up questions. I'm happy to answer them or suggest further reading. I'm happy to also clarify anything I've written.The 1945 general election saw the biggest party swing (12 per cent) from the Conservatives to Labour in British electoral history. Labour gained nearly 250 seats from its opponents, giving the party its first ever majority. This massive swing might initially seem shocking in hindsight; after all, Churchill was widely considered the man who won the war. But looking at the election more closely, this result was not quite so surprising. This was not a reaction against Churchill specifically, or a case of burnout. In understanding why Labour won, we must look at the Labour party's efforts to portray itself as a responsible party able to plan for the future, Conservative failures, and, above all, public experience of the Second World War.**A shock? The Polls, the Press, the Politicians**According to the Gallup Polls, broadly representative of public opinion, the election result really should not be considered a surprise. Had there not even been a campaign, Labour would have won convincingly (and perhaps by an even greater landslide). In February of 1945, the Conservatives enjoyed the support of just 24 per cent of one sample polled; Labour sat, quite securely, on 42 per cent. During the campaign this gap narrowed; by June, the gap was just 12 per cent.^1 By polling day in July, the gap had narrowed to just 8 per cent; and the actual election results showed an 11.5 per cent voting difference between the two parties - not too dissimilar to those that the polls had predicted.The press was broadly agreed that Labour would not win, even on the eve of the election; journalists instead debated the predicted size of the Conservative majority. Gallup Polls were broadly ignored (even by those papers who published them). But we shouldn\u2019t see this as a demonstration of wilful ignorance \u2013 mass opinion polling was very much a novelty in 1945, and people at the time were highly cynical about their results. Some Tories feared, though not publicly, that they were to lose the election. Broadly, though, the Conservatives were confident in an electoral victory. Younger Conservatives like Macmillan and Butler appreciated the need for strong policy on social issues if it were to appeal to the mass electorate, but beyond this there was little intention to adapt Conservative policy as there was post-1945. The Conservatives strongly believed that their wartime record was sufficient for a substantial victory. Labour leaders believed the same. John Bew's recent book *Citizen Clem*, for example, highlights that Clement Attlee was convinced that Churchill must, as the face of resistance to the Nazi menace, win the election.**Churchill**On why Labour won: Let's start with Churchill. There is little doubt that, outside the armed forces, Churchill as an individual remained domestically popular. By the end of the war Gallup polls show he continued to command an 80 per cent approval rating. But he was considered a *great war leader*, and in many respects his public persona was somewhat separated from the qualities of the Conservative party. Such an image did not lend well to an era of postwar reconstruction, where the qualities of a great wartime leader were not especially valuable. Labour propaganda even played upon what we now perceive as Churchill's strengths, portraying him as a warmonger and a man unsuited for peace. Labour's rhetoric continued through into the 1950s, such as the famous [Whose Finger?](_URL_3_) poster in the 1951 election. Churchill continued to be perceived favourably by the public, but his leadership was not seen as one suited to an *era beyond the Second World War*.Fundamentally, the victory in 1945 must be considered in this context; of a nation emerging from a period of devastating warfare. The Conservative party itself was tarnished by its association with the \"guilty men\"; those who were responsible for the policy of appeasement in the late 1930s, and those who underestimated the German threat and took Britain into the war. On top of this, though, by 1945 the electorate's perceptions of the Conservative's interwar record was changed dramatically. The experience of near-full employment during the war contrasted heavily with extremely high levels of unemployment in the late 1920s and under the Conservative-dominated National Governments from 1931, suggesting the Conservatives had been wilfully negligent and even indifferent to high rates of unemployment. Working-class voters in particular distrusted the Conservative government's domestic record, and feared Conservative association with unemployment.^2[Take a look at the Daily Mirror, a left-leaning paper, on the day of the election](_URL_0_): \"Short-lived prosperity gave way to long, tragic years of poverty and unemployment. Make sure that history does not repeat itself\". **Labour's reforms**Labour, similarly, was no longer seen as the party it had been in the 1920s. Recent historiography from historians like Jon Lawrence^2 and Andrew Thorpe stress the extent to which Labour had transformed itself into a party which could genuinely be seen as representing the nation, and a responsible party well-suited to implementing reforms and reconstruction in a post-war environment. Since the party's collapse in 1931, Labour had rethought its vague and anaemic policies; in the 1920s there was no clear plan for creating a socialist commonwealth. But by [1935](_URL_1_) and especially well-demonstrated by Labour's *Immediate Programme* in 1937 (I can't find a free version of this, sorry!), the party had constructed better-defined plans for bringing about socialism.^4 Such plans were very well-suited to a postwar environment in 1945, where \"planning\" was a crucial buzzword. People and politicians sought answers as to how Britain should reconstruct society and economy as it emerged from six years of war, and Labour had already gone some way to providing answers to such questions.Labour was massively more credible because of its crucial role in the wartime coalition government under Churchill. Labour's leader, Clement Attlee, was well-known due to his role in the war, and Labour ministers broadly respected for their domestic roles in the coalition government. The Labour parties of the 1920s under MacDonald, its aims unclear, its socialism ill-defined, and popularly seen as a sectional party seeking purely to further the interests of a unionised working class, was a thing of the past. Attlee's party by 1945 was a responsible and broadly credible party. One must also not forget that Churchill himself quite seriously misjudged the tone of the 1945 election campaign, playing on common tropes of Labour as a sectional party seeking socialist reforms. Churchill thus ignored the fact that the Labour party had truly transformed. This is probably best highlighted by his misguided [\"Gestapo\" election broadcast](_URL_2_), accusing Labour's socialism as being a threat literally equivalent to the Nazis that Britain had just defeated. Such accusations made very little sense; for the last five years Churchill himself had worked closely with Labour ministers in administering a wartime coalition government! Attlee's calm response the following day only highlighted the extent to which Labour could be trusted as a responsible party to govern in the national interest.**Social reform and socialism**Enthusiasm for social reform in a postwar context, which the Labour party was well-suited to implement, is also really worth stressing. Historians such as P. Addison have claimed that the public was \"radicalised\" in its experience of warfare, and heavily favoured a programme of radical social reform. But in more recent years historians have qualified such assertions (including, even, Addison himself). The public may not have been radicalised; but there was broader support for social reform; for full employment, some extent of nationalisation, and housing in particular (though Labour widely failed in housing policy, admittedly). Playing on fears of socialism and Labour's \"sectional\" interests worked well, extremely well in the 1930s; especially after Labour's swing to the left post-1931. But by 1945, both socialism and trade unionism had lost much of their negative associations. After all, the USSR's \"socialism\" was not just blatantly anti-facist; it had also been a fundamental part of its resistance against the Nazi threat. Moreover, by 1945, being anti-socialist was also in many ways seen as being anti-reform. In the wartime coalition it was *Labour* ministers who were placed in domestic posts (with the exception of Rab Butler as Minister of Education), and thus Labour's socialist ideology provided many of the blueprints for economic and social planning. Many of the elements of Labour's socialism were therefore considered a fundamental part of any plan for postwar reconstruction: nationalisation to promote efficiency in industry, full employment, the construction of a welfare state.

The Savings and Loans crisis of the the 1980's resulted in many regulatory reforms.  There are many books on the subject but a good start from its impacts on regulatory reform is \"Savings and Loans Crisis: Lessons of a Regulatory Failure\" (**ISBN-10:** 1402078714).  For the purposes of this discussion, you just need to know that among the regulatory reforms was the desire to bring real estate appraising under universal standards.  The [Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council](_URL_4_), which is a federal government interagency board, created the [Appraisal Subcommittee](_URL_0_) in 1989, which in turn created a non-profit organization called the [Appraisal Foundation](_URL_3_), also in 1989.  The Appraisal Foundation's stated purpose is to, > ...set the Congressionally-authorized\u00a0standards and qualifications for real estate appraisers, and provides voluntary guidance on recognized valuation methods and techniques for all valuation professionals. This work advances the profession by ensuring that appraisals are independent, consistent,\u00a0and objective.You can read more about the Appraisal Foundation's history [here](_URL_1_).  One of the many standards that was adopted is how real estate appraisers measure a structure.  Specifically [ANSI Z765 (Square Footage - Method for Calculating)](_URL_2_).  One of the quirks of ANSI Z765 is that it divides finished areas into two categories \"above grade\" and \"below grade\".  Also, the URAR (Uniform Residential Appraisal Report), which is the most commonly used appraisal report form, includes the Gross Living Area (or GLA)  which only includes finished areas that are above grade.  So in other words, imagine a house that is on a slope and at the back of the house the slope comes 12\" up the back wall.  According to ANSI, the entirety of that level of the house can not be included in the GLA.  In addition, real estate agents when listing properties on the Multiple Listing Service, are supposed to differentiate between the GLA and finished below grade areas.  You can probably see where this is going.  In the typical split level home, that means almost a third of the finished area is not going to be listed in the same section with the rest of the finished area.  In fact, even if the lower section of the split level is only sunken a couple of feet, it is going to be listed in the same section as a house with a completely underground finished basement, despite having windows.So in 1989 with the adoption of these standard, people that have always believed they were living in a 1500 square foot house, suddenly were getting appraisals back that showed on Page 1 of their appraisal that they were living in a 1000 square foot house.  Of course, they didn't lose 500 square feet, rather it simply was being listed in a different part of the report.  However from a marketing standpoint for home builders this was horrible.

The answer is, as always, it depends. It depends upon a lot of factors, such as when in the 19th century you are settling the \"west.\"For example, the settlers who came to the Northwest Territory ( what would be Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and such) often brought lots of tools with them. As did those who traveled the famous ( or infamous) Oregon Trail. That's not to say that they brought everything, but some basics like nails, saws, hammers, axes, and the like would have been indispensible. Settler's buiding skills also would have varied too, with neighbors relying upon each other for manpower and skillsets. Early houses were little more sophisticated than log cabins: (Harrison campaigned on being a frontier child, \"born in a log cabin,\" long before Lincoln for example) or made out of whatever material was close to hand.Later western expansion benefited from advances in technology and trade. Settlers to the Oregon territory in the mid- to late(ish) 19th century would enjoy supplies grom British and American (and other) traders. Whereas early settlers were mostly trappers and traders who made friends with (or married into) native tribes to have that help they seperately needed, by the 1850s and later, trade would have brought supplies, and expertise, by sea. By the end of the 19th century, settling was not nearly so tough. As trains serviced more areas, and telegraphs made communication faster, it was entirely possible to mail order everything you needed from house plans ( complete with supplies and instructions; thank you Montgomery Ward and Sears  &  Roebuck!) to a bride. Granted, it took days or weeks to get what you needed, but it wasn't as onerous as in previous decades.

However, there was no all-encompassing rule; different combinations of personal and political banners could be used, and different captains might even change their standards over the course of campaigns as alliances and allegiances shifted. An example is Giovanni de' Medici: although he was active during the early modern era, he stands out for having painted his banners black after the death of his uncle and employer, Pope Leo X. Giovanni had been in Lombardy as part of a Papal Army commanded by Prospero Colonna: the Papacy had sided with Charles V in a plot to expel the French occupiers from the Duchy of Milan and prop Francesco II Sforza (incidentally Giovanni's maternal cousin). Although Francesco was successfully propped up in Milan, Giovanni refused to return to Rome, and instead his company stayed in Lombardy to help his half-sister, the widowed Countess of San Secondo, assert her right to her late husband's fief against the claims of an ambitious relative. Even though Giovanni would later return to serve under the Papacy, he would forever thereafter be known as Giovanni *Dalle Bande Nere*, meaning Giovanni of the Black Banners. Some employers, notably the Republic of Venice, made a big ceremony of empowering commanders with banners, which in Italy were called \"*Gonfalone*\" (or, more accurately, in the plural form: *Gonfaloni*). This was particularly marked even at the individual company level, because the Venetian army was slightly less dependent on individual captains to raise fighting men: in times of war Venetian cities could be tasked with raising companies who would usually fight under their city banner (sometimes also conducting similar ceremonies to that in Venice) in addition to whatever units were raised by individual *condottieri*. However, here too there was no all-encompassing rule; although a Captain-General presented with a city's banner might be appointed to oversee that individual city's contribution to the Venetian war effort, that city might also delegate raising companies to individual captains who have their own banners. At the end of the day, a banner or pennant needs to serve as a rallying point; a reference point for fighting men so they can keep good order. How that reference point was constructed could depend on the needs of the time, the dynamic of the particular army in question, and the whims of individual commanders. **Edit**: All this is, of course, with definitional problems regarding mercenaries set aside.

A fun series and a good writer, but he takes a number of artistic decisions for the sake of story telling.Generally speaking this sounds unlikely, being as Mongol families often accompanied the army on campaign, so there would not be a 'returning,' in quite that context. And when the sources are discussing the spoiled or lazy nature of Mongol rulers, one of the examples they often give is that they spent more time hunting than ruling. For instance, to depict Jochi (eldest son of Chinggis Khan) as lazy and to discredit his successors, after the fall of Gurganj in 1221 he said to have spent the rest of his life hunting in pro-Toluid sources (see Atwood, \"Jochi and the Early Campaigns,\" for more on this matter.) And Kublai Khan was famed for his hunting trips wherein he would sit on the back of four elephants lashed together (his gout being so bad, and him so obese that horse riding was likely very difficult for him as he aged) and shoot at animals released infront of him, as recorded in Marco Polo.After Temujin, the young Chinggis Khan, lost his father to Tatars and was abandoned by his tribe, he and his family were forced to survive *exclusively* hunting and gathering what they could, eating such things as mice, dogs, birds or even fishing. That sort of hunting was looked down upon by the Mongols, but generally had positive connotations and was an important means to sustain themselves alongside their herds.Further, the Mongols and their successors never took to living, except part time, in palaces, commonly setting up *gers* (yurts in Turkish) in palace gardens or outside of the city. Ogedai Khaan, Chinggis Khan's successor, despite being famed for the construction of Karakorum in Mongolia spent little time living in the city itself, and such customs for the conquerors and their families continued well into the time of Timur and his descendant Babur. Which is not to say they never lived in palaces, but during the height of the united Mongol Empire (1206-1260) palace building and construction never common in Mongolia (though did take place, as not only Karakorum but a number of other small cities and palace like complexes were constructed by Chinggisids, particularly in the Orkhon area). However, there was, particularly as the 13th century wore on, problems with 'spoiled' princes, but our sources depict this more in line with alcoholism and greed than growing up with fine things.  It is notable that the maxims of Chinggis Khan which survive in the sources often relate to limiting alcohol consumption.In the Yuan Dynasty (the Mongol Khanate in China and Mongolia ruled by Kublai Khan and his successors) the ruling court in Dadu (Khanbaliq, modern Beijing) was rather infamous for hedonism, the final Yuan ruler in China often said to have spent his long 3 decade reign distracted by women, alcohol and effectively everything but ruling, though its been shown that this was exaggerated to a large degree by later Chinese writers, and efforts to contrast them with the new Ming Dynastic founder, the Hongwu Emperor. Hongwu wanted to be shown as just, firm, not distracted by worldly distractions as the final Yuan rulers were. We also see throughout the Yuan Dynasty conflict between whether the Mongols should maintain their steppe customs and focus of the empire, using China's wealth for expanding the empire -associated with hunting, herding, livings in *gers* and the military- or adopt sedentary customs and focus on ruling the Chinese -associated with living in palaces, living in China. This was a serious conflict which often turned to armed violence and coups, and few Yuan emperors died natural deaths.Iggulden's (if this was in fact from him, I do apologize if this is wrong, but I can't access my copies of his books right now) depiction of Mongol reactions to children spoiled by sedentary (generally, Chinese) customs does in fact reflect a serious problem which the Mongols faced being a softer life with sedentary aspects, or the leaner world of the steppe. But hunting as punishment seems unlikely. When we are in the period of Mongols being ''returning' from their campaigns to Mongolia (so, the period from 1209-1260), those sons were in all possibility on campaign alongside their fathers (conscription for military service started around 15), or taking roles in the maintenance of the herds and production of arms and armour for the warriors, which even with the influx of slaves and goods from the conquests still needed to be done.

He subscribes to the theory that that plague in particular came from Africa, but the concept is the same. Basically, plague (*Y. pestis*) exists in several natural \"reservoirs\" around the world. These reservoirs consist of rodents such as wild gerbils that are: a) highly resistant to the effects of *Y. pestis* but nonetheless propagate the disease and b) are solitary and do not often come into contact with other susceptible rodents and/or primates.    The spreading of the disease of course comes from the fleas, who become infected when they feed on the infected members of the reservoir. Worse, the effect of the plague on fleas is that they can't process food properly, so they panic and feed on everything in sight, hastening the spread of the disease.    So how do outbreaks happen? Well, during periods of extreme weather, the territory of these reservoir gerbils (or whatever) can be pushed into new areas. This may cause the spread of the disease to a more invasive species, like the black rat. Rats have no problem infringing on human living spaces, so when rats hitch a ride along trade routes, such as with goods coming from Africa to the Byzantine Empire during the time of Justinian, you see the spread of the disease to areas other than the source of the plague reservoirs themselves. To make matters worse, Justinian was working to reconquer the lost Western Roman Empire, and also dealing with the Persians under Khusrau at the same time, so that particular plague spread to those areas, too.

This particular set of grievances is noted by Siegfried Hoyer and Peter Blickle for its strong and \"interesting\" anticlericalism. (Looking to a religious lord--the bishop of Augsburg--instead of a secular one may have had something to do with that, but this was absolutely not a prerequisite for expressions of anticlericalism in the 1520s.)

In fact, the English phrasing seems even stronger than the German, a pattern that appears with several of the other articles as well.To provide a little context for this claim, two points are helpful. First, for medieval Christians burial in consecrated ground was *critical*. The geography of the dead represented belonging in the Christian community in heaven as well as on earth. Preacher/theologian John Mirk's views on the burial of women who died while pregnant show just how strongly medieval people could feel about consecrated versus unconsecrated ground. Mirk argued that pregnant women who died before delivery should be denied burial until their lifeless fetus could be cut out of their stomach--because the baby was unbaptized, already in hell, and no Christian at all. Mirk's view was not universal, but it was common. (Unsurprisingly, shrines had sprung up that specialized in temporary revival of stillborn children...just long enough for baptism to occur.) In late medieval England, parish guilds were known to raise money to pay for the burial of a member fallen on hard times--burial fees were indeed a burden.(Death dues, banned by article #12, were more like an estate tax on property upon someone's death, if they had any, rather than a service fee for burial.)Second, over the course of the fifteenth century, scholars have noticed a pattern in burial fees. Even where the fees themselves stayed flat, from the point of view of the deceased person's family, the percentage of the fee filling the personal coffer of the graveyard church's clerical overseer increased a little or a lot. Priests and deacons were benefiting as people, rather than (from medieval people's view) the Church receiving a donation for prayers and souls.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Peasants War was a conflict between the English Crown and the English peasantry in the early 16th century.

The British still had a great deal of investment in the **economy** of North America and sought to influence the development of the continent **politically** as well. It's somewhat difficult to separate these aspects, though, so I'll go through the decades after the War for Independence chronologically.**1783 - 1791**The Treaty of Paris left several issues between the US and Great Britain unresolved. One of these was the question of debt. American courts, to make a very complicated story more streamlined, often weighed in favor of American debtors in issues of debts owed to *British* interests. This was a problem large enough that the British, though stipulated by the treaty, refused to remove British soldiers from fur trade posts in the Great Lakes region, meaning that not only were soldiers literally occupying American territory, but because of their location - at Detroit, Mackinac Island, and elsewhere - the British were still largely in control of the North American fur trade, which was as close to a booming industry in the borderlands as there was prior to the industrial revolution. Not only did the British position themselves to take all the fees, duties, taxes, and other revenue from the trade, but it also, and possibly more importantly, positioned them to exert an unquantifiable influence over the region's native groups. As we'll see in a moment, the Great Lakes native groups were still a powerful factor in North America that could not be discounted.Methods of dealing with the issue of debt were *eventually* somewhat set aside by Hamilton's financial plan, as the plan allowed the US government to absorb the debt of individual debtors owed to British debt-holders and roll them into its own national debt. It helped to mollify this particular post-war issue, but even after the plan slowly rolled out and came into use (around 1790-91), the British still obstinately kept troops in and around the Great Lakes.**1791-1796**Their position allowed them to, as Americans saw it, \"stir up\" hostilities between the United States and the various native groups in the area. There is *some *degree of truth to this. British Indian agents, like long-timer Matthew Elliot, not only promised aid and political protection to Natives friendly to the British, but also supplied arms and, in at least one occasion, men to aid attacks against Americans.But the British were not driving the bus of Native resistance. Ill-treatment from Americans, general dishonesty and a failure to own up to the stipulations of old treaties had been driving Indian animosity to the Americans since *before* the War for Independence, and many Natives still saw the British as their allies in an ongoing conflict with Americans.By the end of the 1780s, a complicated confederacy of Northwest Natives was forming under no clear, stand-out leader, though individuals like Blue Jacket, Black Hoof, and Little Turtle were influential warleaders. Tribes all along the Wabash River and elsewhere were uniting, albeit temporarily, in their resistance to the increased encroachment of American settlers into treaty territory, and by 1790, they were large, aggressive, and organized enough that the Americans perceived them as a threat.There were several attempts to deal with the Wabash Confederacy, but the effort disintegrated after a battle so utterly disastrous to American forces that it was dubbed \"St. Clair's Defeat.\" General Arthur St. Clair and his army were attacked in camp in November, 1791, in modern-day Ohio, and were utterly and stupendously crushed by forces under Blue Jacket and Little Turtle. *632* soldiers were *killed*, and more than 200 wounded. Additionally, more than 200 civilians, auxiliaries to the army and camp-followers, were also killed. In terms of scale, with respect to the size of the US army at the time, this was the *largest defeat of an American army in history*, and set the Indian War back another two years at least.While the British had supplied aid and support, politically and in materiel, this was not *their* war. It was a Native struggle on Native terms and with Native goals. This was proved years later, after the United States hastily assembled another army under Anthony Wayne, which slowly advanced into Indian territory, fort by fort, and eventually defeated the Confederacy at the Battle of Fallen Timbers.Historians debate the effect of the battle, but regardless of its outcome, many Native minds were made to end resistance when Native forces retreated from the battle to nearby Fort Miamis, a British fort on the Miami River and the British, against their earlier promises of support, shut their doors to their apparent allies.This was done, according to the British, because of the Americans' willingness to fire on the fort, which would pull the British into a North American war they did not want. Wayne exchanged letters with the British commander, Major William Campbell, and both showed a willingness to fire on the other given provocation. Campbell wrote a message to Wayne after spotting Wayne's army encamping nearby, more or less stating that \"you have been here a day and we see you, what is your intention?\" Wayne's response speaks for itself: >  Without questioning the Authority or the propriety Sir, of your interrogatory, I think I may without breach of decorum observe to you, that were you entitled to an Answer, the most full and satisfactory one was announced to you, from the Muzzels of my small Arms yesterday morning in the Action against the hoard of Savages in the Vicinity of your Post, which terminated Gloriously to the American Arms - but had it continued until the Indians  & c were drove under the influence of the Post and Guns you mention - they would not have much impeded the progress of the Victorious Army under my command, as no such Post was Established at the Commencement of the present War, between the Indians and the United States.In other words, \"we see you too, we'd happily vanquish you like we vanquished the Indians, and you shouldn't be here anyway, so who are you to ask?\"It took a couple of days for Campbell to answer, and those days were full of provocative insults and tensely guarded weapons. Wayne was apparently willing to allow his messenger to be killed, so that he could \"massacre the damn lot of them.\" Campbell's response made sure to mention that any retaliation on his part would be retaliation against *Wayne* and not in a general sense against the United States as a whole. Even at *this* point, the British were neither prepared nor interested in reconquering the United States. The Northwest Indian War ended when the Treaty of Greenville set back the Amero-Indian border back a few hundred miles and allowed settlement into the Ohio territory.More or less simultaneously, American diplomats along with John Jay agreed on settlement terms to withdraw British influence from the Great Lakes in the Jay Treaty, and in 1796 American forces - often under the command of officers and subalterns of Wayne's \"Legion of the United States\" moved in and took over Great Lakes posts, ending a thirteen-year question mark over the hegemony of that region.I have to run real quick, but part 2 and sources later tonight!", "label": 0}, {"content": "After the American Revolutionary War, the British government remained committed to reclaiming the American colonies.

Last Halloween in fact I posted a selection of spooky Roman ghost stories that often seem *very* similar to modern ones, so I'll reproduce it here. But if you are interested in the topic, I would recommend Daniel Ogden's *magic, Witchcraft and Ghosts in the Greek and Roman World*. He actually makes the interesting case that Greco-Roman magic in general was based around necromancy and communication with ghosts, although I don't find his argument entirely convincing. Anyway I'm happy to answer specific questions but in general I think the best place to start is just read the stories:The first from Pliny the Younger VII, letter 27: > There was at Athens a large and spacious, but ill reputed and pestilential house. In the dead of the night a noise, resembling the clashing of iron, was frequently heard, which, if you listened more attentively, sounded like the rattling of fetters; at first it seemed at a distance, but approached nearer by degrees; immediately afterward a phantom appeared in the form of an old man, extremely meager and squalid, with a long beard and bristling hair; rattling the gyves on his feet and hands. The poor inhabitants consequently passed sleepless nights under the most dismal terrors imaginable. > This, as it broke their rest, threw them into distempers, which, as their horrors of mind increased, proved in the end fatal to their lives. For even in the day time, though the specter did not appear, yet the remembrance of it made such a strong impression on their imaginations that it still seemed before their eyes, and their terror remained when the cause of it was gone. By this means the house was at last deserted, as being judged by everybody to be absolutely uninhabitable; so that it was now entirely abandoned to the ghost. However, in hopes that some tenant might be found who was ignorant of this great calamity which attended it, a bill was put up, giving notice that it was either to be let or sold.      > It happened that Athenodorus the philosopher came to Athens at this time, and reading the bill ascertained the price. The extraordinary cheapness raised his suspicion; nevertheless, when he heard the whole story, he was so far from being discouraged, that he was more strongly inclined to hire it, and, in short, actually did so. When it grew towards evening, he ordered a couch to be prepared for him in the fore part of the house, and after calling for a light, together with his pen and tablets, he directed all his people to retire within. But that his mind might not, for want of employment, be open to the vain terrors of imaginary noises and apparitions, he applied himself to writing with all his faculties. > The first part of the night passed with usual silence, then began the clanking of iron fetters; however, he neither lifted up his eyes, nor laid down his pen, but closed his ears by concentrating his attention. The noise increased and advanced nearer, till it seemed at the door, and at last in the chamber. He looked round and saw the apparition exactly as it had been described to him: it stood before him, beckoning with the finger. Athenodorus made a sign with his hand that it should wait a little, and bent again to his writing, but the ghost rattling its chains over his head as he wrote, he looked round and saw it beckoning as before. Upon this he immediately took up his lamp and followed it. The ghost slowly stalked along, as if encumbered with its chains; and having turned into the courtyard of the house, suddenly vanished. Athenodorus being thus deserted, marked the spot with a handful of grass and leaves. The next day he went to the magistrates, and advised them to order that spot to be dug up. There they found bones commingled and intertwined with chains; for the body had mouldered away by long lying in the ground, leaving them bare, and corroded by the fetters. The bones were collected, and buried at the public expense; and after the ghost was thus duly laid the house was haunted no more.What I love about this story is that if you changed the philosopher to a schoolteacher, it could easily be set in Savannah. It is a classic tale.The other one is from Plutarch's \"Life of Cimon\", and it goes to show that ghost stories have always been used to talk about social issues: > There was left one orphan of this house, called Damon, surnamed Peripoltas, in beauty and greatness of spirit surpassing all of his age, but rude and undisciplined in temper. A Roman captain of a company that wintered in Chaeronea became passionately fond of this youth, who was now pretty nearly grown a man. And finding all his approaches, his gifts, his entreaties, alike repulsed, he showed violent inclinations to assault Damon. Our native Chaeronea was then in a distressed condition, too small and too poor to meet with anything but neglect. Damon, being sensible of this, and looking upon himself as injured already, resolved to inflict punishment. Accordingly, he and sixteen of his companions conspired against the captain; but that the design might be managed without any danger of being discovered, they all daubed their faces at night with soot. Thus disguised and inflamed with wine, they set upon him by break of day, as he was sacrificing in the market-place; and having killed him, and several others that were with him, they fled out of the city, which was extremely alarmed and troubled at the murder. > The council assembled immediately, and pronounced sentence of death against Damon and his accomplices. This they did to justify the city to the Romans. But that evening, as the magistrates were at supper together, according to the custom, Damon and his confederates, breaking into the hall, killed them, and then fled again out of the town. About this time, Lucius Lucullus chanced to be passing that way with a body of troops, upon some expedition, and this disaster having but recently happened, he stayed to examine the matter. Upon inquiry, he found the city was in no wise faulty, but rather that they themselves had suffered; therefore he drew out the soldiers, and carried them away with him. Yet Damon continuing to ravage the country all about, the citizens, by messages and decrees, in appearance favourable, enticed him into the city, and upon his return, made him Gymnasiarch; but afterwards as he was anointing himself in the vapour baths, they set upon him and killed him. > For a long while after apparitions continuing to be seen, and groans to be heard in that place, so our fathers have told us, they ordered the gates of the baths to be built up; and even to this day those who live in the neighbourhood believe that they sometimes see spectres and hear alarming sounds. The posterity of Damon, of whom some still remain, mostly in Phocis, near the town of Stiris, are called Asbolomeni, that is, in the Aeolian idiom, men daubed with soot: because Damon was thus besmeared when he committed this murder.And finally, did you know that Augustus' childhood home was haunted? From Suetonius, \"Life of Augustus\" 6: > His nursery is shown to this clay, in a villa belonging to the family, in the suburbs of Velitrae; being a very small place, and much like a pantry. An opinion prevails in the neighbourhood, that he was also born there. Into this place no person presumes to enter, unless upon necessity, and with great devotion, from a belief, for a long time prevalent, that such as rashly enter it are seized with great horror and consternation, which a short while since was confirmed by a remarkable incident. For when a new inhabitant of the house had, either by mere chance, or to try the truth of the report, taken up his lodging in that apartment, in the course of the night, a few hours afterwards, he was thrown out by some sudden violence, he knew not how, and was found in a state of stupefaction, with the coverlet of his bed, before the door of the chamber.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Romans believed in ghosts, but they were not the same as our modern ghosts.

This was often explicitly stated in treaties. These could be overruled at the whim of the Romans, particularly when local laws contradicted an imperial policy, but sometimes an Emperor even allowed a local law to be enforced if it went against Roman wishes.  One of our best examples of this is from the Emperor Trajan. We have some of his correspondence with Pliny, who was governor of Pontus, what is now northern Turkey.The Amiseni wanted to establish a charitable society, but were rather careful because Rome tended to frown upon such associations because they could be breeding grounds of rebellion or dissent. They, being good subjects, petitioned Pliny to make sure it was okay. Pliny, being a good governor, doublechecked with Trajan. The Emperor replied: >  If the petition of the Amiseni which you have transmitted to me, concerning the establishment of a charitable society, be agreeable to their own laws, which by the articles of alliance it is stipulated they shall enjoy, I shall not oppose it; especially if these contributions are employed, not for the purpose of riot and faction, but for the support of the indigent. In other cities, however, which are subject to our laws, I would have all assemblies of this nature prohibited.Trajan says the same thing in other letters, such as laws about the recovery of debts and the fee to be admitted to local senates. In each case, he tells Pliny to follow the local laws.This was actually an extremely long-standing policy of Rome as they expanded and consolidated. They wanted obedience, manpower and taxes from the people and lands they conquered. Other than that, they didn\u2019t care that much what the provinces did. Some places had their own laws, own calendars, own currency, own languages and own traditions \u2013 all while under the subjugation of Rome.Note this mainly applied to areas which already had an established governance structure, such as in the developed cities and territories of the Greek East. This also was contingent upon how they fell under Roman control \u2013 like how Trajan mentions the \u2018article of alliance\u2019. Some areas didn\u2019t have this legal right to follow their own laws. And if they had ever rebelled, you can be sure that the right to follow their own laws would probably have been revoked.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Roman Republic allowed the subjugated people to carry out their own justice based on their laws and customs.

French authors indulged in a great deal of composition with Arthurian themes, but they were not necessarily the source of Arthurian tradition - including the legends told of Arthur and his court. In fact, Arthur was (and is) so intimately tied to Britain, that one could ask why French authors were attracted to this body of folklore, rather than why the English embraced the tradition.Arthurian folklore has deep roots in Wales and Cornwall. If we accept the controversial conclusions of O.J. Padel, Geoffrey of Monmouth (c.1095\u20131155), author of The History of the Kings of Britain, came from Cornwall and Cornish folklore was also behind the Tristan cycle of Arthurian literature: Geoffrey of Monmouth is one of the first authors to write extensively about Arthur. We can add to this the late fourteenth-century \"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\", which demonstrates that by the medieval period, England had also embraced Arthur and his court.The question, then, is more about how the Arthurian tradition spread to French writers - and to other authors (for it was also popular in the Germanies and elsewhere). One can look to Brittany with its close ties and common language with Cornwall as a possible path for Arthurian tradition to reach France, but one must keep in mind that until fairly late, parts of France were held by the King of England. That resulted, of course, in considerable conflict - notably to the Hundred Years War (1337-1453), but all that was in response to those close ties, so it is not surprising to see shared traditions and literature.Sources: O.J.

Evidence from British and American vessels suggests that it was fairly common. However, it definitely varied from ship to ship. One important thing to remember is that the rape of enslaved women existed within a certain set of existing power relationships. A captain had absolute power within a ship, and was able to prevent his crew from raping enslaved women if he desired. When a British parliamentary investigation asked a slave ship captain \"Is there any Care taken to prevent any Intercourse between White Men and the Black Women?\" a captain responded, \"Orders are generally issued for that Purpose by the Commanding Officer.\" Most commonly, the captain allowed officers to rape the captive women without limitation, while ordinary sailors might be punished for doing so. A British surgeon named Alexander Falconbridge wrote, > on board some ships, the common sailors are allowed to have intercourse with such of the black women whose consent they can procure... [whereas the officers] are permitted to indulge their passions among them at pleasure, and sometimes are guilty of such brutal excesses as disgrace human nature.A reverend remembered,  > the Captain and Officers still indulge their desires unrestrained, and the common sailors are allowed to take for the voyage any female Negro whose consent they can obtain.The idea of consent is undoubtedly a difficult one in this context. After all, in a slave ship, there was no way for an enslaved woman to be on an equal level of power with a white sailor. However, the sailors clearly understood a distinction between raping slaves and some form of sex that was somehow less than rape (possibly a situation in which a captive woman submitted to a white man's sexual advances with the understanding that it would improve her conditions on the ship). I've taken this information and the analysis from Marcus Rediker's *The Slave Ship* (2007) (pp. 242-243).

These were: Eastern Lunda kingdom under the Kazembe dynasty; the Bemba or Wemba under the successors to King Chiti; the Lozi or Barotse kingdom under Lewanyika that managed to maintain a great deal of autonomy even under the BSAC; and the multinational Chewa complex whom I know much less about, although its Phiri clan was prominent among educated Zambians at independence.None of these four are what I would term matriarchial or strictly matrilineal.  They were kingdoms where male lineage was the crucial element of temporal authority.  However, women's power in these societies was still enormous; matrilocality and matriclans were vital in power struggles and succession, women had major advisory roles and could have local political power in certain areas, and women could exercise certain kinds of social and political power (especially connected to spirituality) that men could not.  That, indeed, was diminished if not dismissed by Europeans, who assumed that true authority was male all the way up and down.Insofar as women's power was diminished with the coming of the BSAC, it had to do with the Company's support of male authorities against women who had wielded checks on their power--a common element of rule that skewed the gender dynamics in African societies and became naturalized by the end of the colonial era.  So if the \"majority of traditional leadership\" means all levels, within a society, even if that society is centered on kingship and chiefship which are male, it's possible to make the statement that much traditional leadership did accrue to women, and it's undeniable that women's power in political matters collapsed under colonial rule. So there's some truth in the statement, but not all of it; I'd be interested to hear details about precisely which societies were considered led by women.  I was looking for a sign of this in BJ Phiri's recent *Political History of Zambia*, but he really starts with the Company.  It's not handled systematically in Vansina, Curtin, et al., in any case.[edit: I should point out that men connected to chiefship and kingship in the colonial era have another reason to blame the British and BSAC for the gender disparity--it diverts attention from their own role in accepting that shift and prospering by it.  It's a cynical way to look at the thing, but I see it operating in the discussion over so-called traditional leadership and its power in South Africa today as well, as a way of muddying the issue of the exclusion of women's voices in rural communities.]", "label": 0}, {"content": "The British were not the only ones to have a problem with women in leadership positions.

Unfortunately, I cannot provide a broad answer to this question, but what I can give is one case illustrating the interaction between the US military and Mafia bosses during WWII. Lucky Luciano was a high level figure in the Italian American Mafia in New York in the 1930s, heavily involved in prostitution, gambling, and a variety of other extra-legal trades. In 1936, he was given a 30-50 year sentence for involuntary prostitution.In 1946, however, Lucky had his sentence commuted. He was released from prison, under the condition that he return to his native Italy. Of course, after his release, he more or less continued business as usual, though run from outside the US, and actually made it to Havana for a bit, at which point he helped establish the American Mob in Cuba. But that's a different (though even more interesting) story. Where Lucky's story relates to the question comes in that stretch between getting arrested, and getting paroled after doing ten years on a 30-50 year sentence. According to multiple sources from within the US Navy (as reported by newspapers at the time), Lucky assisted US war efforts against Germany and Italy throughout WWII. According to these sources, he provided intelligence regarding collaborators on the New York City waterfront, where he still held considerable sway.Now, as soon as he was paroled, the entire case blew up in the public imagination in a firestorm of rumor and intrigue, with various newspapers at the time painting lurid pictures of the close relationship between Lucky and the Navy, and the Navy desperately denying that Lucky had had anything to do with them, as can be expected.I've done a fair amount of primary source work on this topic, mostly looking at FBI surveillance records released under FOIA, regarding the multi-decade surveillance of Luciano. It is my opinion, based on these primary sources, that Luciano did in fact collaborate with the Navy during the war, which secured his post-war release.While this is just one case, the nature of the way in which it was exposed to the public, and the degree to which it was dogmatically denied by the powers that be, allow us to extrapolate a little bit. It is quite likely that, if one mob boss was used for intelligence, this was a strategy that was at least explored regarding other bosses. At the same time, the fury that the collaboration between Lucky and the Navy (not to mention Lucky's subsequent parole) was regarded with suggests that open Mafia support of the US war effort did not really exist. Sources: My knowledge on this topic actually comes from a paper I wrote on FBI surveillance of American mob bosses in Cuba in the 1950s, so my secondary sources tend to be geared towards that side of things, but they do provide some interesting information on this subject nonetheless: Rovner, E.S. *The Cuban Connection: Drug Trafficking, Smuggling, and Gambling in Cuba from the 1920s to the Revolution* (2008)English, T.J. *Havana Nocturne How the Mob Owned Cuba... and then Lost it to the Revolution* (2008)Schwartz, Rosalie, *Pleasure Island: Tourism and Temptation in Cuba* (1997)However, far and away the best sources on this are the FBI's own surveillance records. You can search for them in academic databases under the title:\"Mafia in Florida and Cuba: FBI Surveillance of Meyer Lansky and Santo Trafficante, Jr\"The files with information on Lucky and his actions during WWII are referenced with the name and number:Charles \"Lucky\" Luciano, NY 62-8768, 1.

Rome slowly but surely made its allies part of its system, for every defeat of a neighbouring village Rome allowed the defeated village to become a part of the Roman system. Subdued foes fought for it as part of the Roman army, and while subdued elites were not Senators and didn't have citizenship they still very much formed part of the Roman system and reaped the rewards from being part of it. This gave the Romans a huge pool of manpower to play with compared to other states. Especially when Rome started to be willing to hand out citizenship.Carthage on the other hand was a city state, it relied on a couple of field armies led by a small core if its citizens and never made any particular attempt to expand its citizenship or rights to its subjects. Allies served as just allies for the campaign or war they were involved in. Foreign elites were bribed and given gifts but never really integrated. Soldiers were hired as soldiers rather than serving as part and parcel of an integrated army. Its also worth noting that territory is not equal to resources. Lets take the Second Punic War as an example: While on paper Carthage was larger in the Second Punic War you need to examine which bits were under actual control and how long that was the case. Carthage controlled much of North Africa and Spain, however only a chunk of North Africa was actually Carthaginian territory by itself, the rest of it was held by subject Numidians who had a frequently antagonistic relationship with Carthage. Meanwhile in Spain it was Hannibals father who had done much of the legwork in turning it into \"Carthaginian territory\" if we look at Spain at the time though it was made of a plethora of tribes and villages who were locked into a raiding and prestige lifestyle. Again this ensured the territory was in no way actually Carthaginian. These people were fighters, they fought for honour and for money with each other and against the Carthaginians. As long as the Carthaginians could give them money and show they were strong they would fight for them, the minute weakness was shown then there would be no incentive to fight, which is just what happened when the Romans started to make inroads to the area. Compare this to Italy where Rome controlled a much more dense web of allies in the Latin states immediately around it, these areas where very much part of the system and willingly sent men to fight for Rome and kept on doing so throughout the dark days of Hannibal right until there were literally no more men to send. Its in the South where Hannibal made some gains amongst the former Greek city-states but even then surprisingly few of them turned and none of them were especially useful at reinforcing Hannibal when they did turn. In a way they crippled him because the more defected the more Hannibal had to protect and he had only a single army to do that with. Rome could very much grind him down and take city after city and leave him with no good choices to make. Couple that with the crippling logistics issues with trying to get Carthage to actually reinforce him and you see why he couldn't win. On that note we'll move onto logistics and politics. Now logistically sailing in the ancient world relied on access to food and water for the crews, any attempt to reinforce Hannibal in Italy would rely on sailing for several days via hostile territory and in the face of enemy resistance and landed a few thousand more troops. Not exactly the easiest thing to do... Politically there was also the clear difference between the Roman and Carthaginian senate. Each year the Romans could and did give clear priorities to one theatre or another and allocate resources for the entire state, this was light years ahead of the Carthaginian effort which only seemingly knew what Hannibal was about to do when the Romans arrived and asked to them to ensure he didn't cross the Ebro and attack Roman allies. There was a distinct level of infighting and not knowing what the left hand was doing compared to the Roman method of clear allocation and command responsibilities in the war effort.

Their generalship was weak, and completely outclassed by the British in North Africa. However, a lot of other factors contributed to the crushing defeat at the beginning of that campaign. The Italians had no real military tradition, and their officer corps was not only spread thin but poorly trained. Their equipment was abysmal at the start of the war; their tanks and armored cars completely unreliable. Not only did they have a ghastly shortage of tanks; but the heaviest hitter they had at the start of that campaign was the M11/39, which was not only outgunned and outperformed by the British cruiser tanks, but also was designed in such a way that the main gun could basically only shoot forward. And the British already had the Matilda, whose armor literally could not be pierced by anything in the Italian arsenal at the time.Anyway, I digress. They had a shortage of tanks, which were already poor. The rest of the equipment was similarly torrid; the Italian industry base was small compared to the German or British one, and they simply could not keep up with the demands of a military that Mussolini saw conquering the entire Mediterranean. They were poorly equipped and poorly trained, which led to a few quick defeats at the hands of a vastly outnumber British force. Having been defeated in such a manner was obviously crushing to morale, so that compounded the problem.But, after the early disasters, Rommel arrived with German reinforcements, and Italy also sent more troops. Under the German command, Italian soldiers performed more than admirably, even when still supplied with updated yet thoroughly inferior equipment. This has been noted in memoirs of many Germans who fought alongside them, including Rommel, who has praised the Italians many times. Just on Wikiquote, there are two sourced quotes by Rommel on the quality of Italian soldiers. \"Good soldiers, bad officers; however don't forget that without them we would not have any Civilization.\", and about the Italian elite light infantry: \"The German soldier has impressed the world, however the Italian *Bersagliere* soldier has impressed the German soldier.\"The lack of success for Italy's military can be attributed to just about everything except the quality of Italy's men. The same goes for the French defeat, where a fault of military doctrine has now placed a huge black mark on French military prowess for years to come.

He was a prolific satirist, a style exemplified by his essay *A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Poor People From Being a Burden to Their Parents or Country, and for Making Them Beneficial to the Public*, as it is fully titled. For those unfamiliar with the work, the crux of Swift's satire lies in the following excerpt, as taken from [University College Cork](_URL_2_): > I am assured by our merchants, that a boy or a girl before twelve years old is no salable commodity; and even when they come to this age they will not yield above \u00a33, or \u00a33, 2s. 6d. at most, on the exchange; which cannot turn to account either to the parents or kingdom, the charge of nutriment and rags having been at least four times that value. > I shall now therefore humbly propose my own thoughts, which I hope will not be liable to the least objection. > I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London, that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious, nourishing, and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee or a ragout.A stinging counter to the Establishment perceptions of the native Irish, Swift parodied the endemic 'popular'  solutions to the 'problem' of Ireland, by suggesting that they simply *eat the poor*, or rather their infant children. It [*may have*](_URL_1_) been seen as a rebuke to anti-Irish sentiment, exemplified by [Edmund Spenser](_URL_6_) and his truly vile [*A Veue of the Present State of Irelande*](_URL_4_), an unreadable work I will not paraphrase such is my distaste for it.But that is not the question you asked, is it?Public can be read in several ways, though I take it to mean here that you are asking what the common *volk*, which in Ireland would be the Catholic underclass, thought in regards to *A Modest Proposal*. Though this is a common sort of question, I would caution that you may not be satisfied in this regard, as the 'official' record of History is not always particularly concerned with the common people generally, for a variety of reasons.

Nevertheless, there are very enterprising scholars here so if such documents do exist, I've no doubt they will produce them!But... as I am a folklorist I will, as is my habit, detour into the oral tradition and what it has to say of Swift. As I've said many times the oral tradition is enormously conservative and is a useful tool for illuminating cultural perceptions... Yet temper your expectations, as the tradition is shaped by the priorities of the *people who produce it* rather than ours. Jonathan Swift is indeed a prominent figure in folk tradition: Despite being a first generation Anglo-Irish member of the Protestant upper class and an Anglican Cleric, he was very popular with the native Irish in no small part due to his satirical work targeting the English establishment. However much like the [D\u00f3nall \u00d3 Conaill of folk memory] (_URL_0_) the folk tradition surrounding Swift is less concerned with history or the politics of the period, rather it largely consists of humorous anecdotes of Swift and his apocryphal servant, who is often called 'Jack'. These stories tend to show while Swift was clever, his 'common' servant could be cleverer still; and indeed this was a trait that has peerless value in Irish folklore, and is reflected in figures ranging from the aforementioned D\u00f3nall \u00d3 Conaill to the legendary Fionn mac Cumhaill.For instance, one story relates how Jack came to be employed by Swift:     >  Three applicants answered his advertisement for a servant, and the learned clergyman decided to test their memories. He therefore told them to repeat after him the words 'Lamb of God, who takest away the sins of the world, have mercy on us', and to return to him a year later and repeat the sentence. The year passed, and at the appointed time the first two applicants came to the dean and repeated the sentence. The third fellow, however, had altered the words to 'sheep of God' and, when the dean queried this, stated that what was a lamb a year ago would be fully grown by now. The dean was amazed at his wit, and gave the position to him. This was the redoubtable Jack.Once employed, Jack is in every way a match and better for the cleverness of his Master: >  In order to teach him a lesson, Swift locks him into the kitchen with no meat and orders him to cook meat for a meal. Jack takes the leather from the Dean's walking boots, cooks this and serves it up as tripe. Swift is very pleased with the meal, but when he looks for his boots later, he realizes what has happened. He flies into a rage, and tells Jack that as punishment he will be allowed nothing to eat until he sees 'water running against a hill'. Then the dean goes riding, with Jack running alongside the horse. When they stop to let the horse drink, Jack remarks that this is water running uphill.The most popular story concerns Jack preparing goose for Swift: >  Jack is hungry and eats a leg of the goose before he serves it at table. When Swift queries this, Jack says that geese have only one leg. Later when they go riding, they see a flock of wild geese with one leg under their wings, and Jack points this out as proof of his earlier assertion. Swift claps his hands and says 'Whoosh!' with the result that the geese put down both legs and fly away. Jack, however, counters this by asking why he had not said 'whoosh' to the cooked goose.All of these are examples of tale motifs that have been adapted to Swift, and there are dozens of such stories of Swift and his servant. This is not wholly a concoction of the oral tradition however, as Swift was well known for his 'tomfoolery' and penned a tract called [*Directions to Servants*](_URL_8_), of which a brief excerpt gives a further insight into his view of authority and power structure as much as his wit and personality: >  When your Master or Lady call a Servant by Name, if that Servant be not in the Way, none of you are to answer, for then there will be no End of your Drudgery: And Masters themselves allow, that if a Servant comes when he is called, it is sufficient. >  When you have done a Fault, be always pert and insolent, and behave your self as if you were the injured Person; this will immediately put your Master or Lady off their Mettle. >  If you see your Master wronged by any of your Fellow-servants, be sure to conceal it, for fear of being called a Tell-tale: However, there is one Exception, in case of a favourite Servant, who is justly hated by the whole Family; you are therefore bound in Prudence to lay all the Faults you can upon the Favourite.The tradition ran more contrary to Swift's own life in several other cases, for instance anecdotes of Swift and his supposed wife, though Swift himself [never married](_URL_7_). Likewise there was a widespread Catholic perception of Swift, the Dean of Saint Patrick's mind you, as secretly inclined towards the Roman faith. This is demonstrative again of the oral tradition serving the needs and beliefs of its participants rather than its subjects. We *might* infer a popular perception of Swift as favored friend to the Irish Catholic, which may have informed whatever perception of his work there may have been in that contemporary period, but that would be speculation.I apologize I'm not able to address your question directly, but I hope this can provide some context to it generally.Much of this material is drawn from the collected works of the great D\u00e1th\u00ed \u00d3 h\u00d3g\u00e1in, and all of this can be considered the product of his research.

From all the information that I gathered on this very peculiar election, Harrison' health wasn't a significant issue during the campaign. His age could have been, and the Democrats kinda tried to make it one when one of them said that Harrison would be better off staying in a log cabin, thinking about life and such, like a retirement thing. Note  that on this point, the focus wasn't specially on Harrison age but it could have been interpreted that way. Anyway, it was a communication failure since the Whigs span the whole \"log cabin\" thing into a way to make Harrison \"a man of the people\", using imagery and story-telling to create a likable character from scratch. So to answer your question, as far as I know, I don't recall any instance of big debates and discussion about Harrison health and/or age. But then again, I only focus on the campaign communication aspect and am at the beginning of this research of mine, so maybe some historians could go more in depth on the topic.

We can see especially in accounts of warfare that sexual violence was indeed a deep concern for medieval women themselves, and certainly it was a preoccupation for medieval clerics frequently more concerned with women's chastity than women themselves were--but no, women were not worrying about the duke sweeping them off to the castle for a fortnight or a lifetime.First, from a religious-legal and hence moral perspective, both Christian canon law (which regulated sex and marriage) and Islamic law prohibited either rape or additional marriage. Canon law barred sex outside marriage as well as multiple spouses, and was very very restrictive on opportunities for divorce. There are cases in early medieval Italy of lords practicing bigamy or keeping official concubines, and surely there were plenty of *unofficial* ones elsewhere and in later years, but neither rape or kidnapping someone else's wife were approved practices. Islamic law limits sex to either marriage or a master with his own female slave, in which case she accrues special protection. (And the law limits this practice to slaves the man, specifically, owns--even his wife's personal slaves are off limits). While men can have multiple wives, the reverse is not true. So Islamic lords in al-Andalus are also not plucking random peasant wives for themselves. (Muslims cannot be *made* slaves by other Muslims, legally, so that's not a loophole).Second, the question of marriage. No, a lord is not going to marry a random peasant. Marriage among the medieval nobility was a political institution first and foremost, however the Church tried to promote it (and make no mistake, the Church's interest in marriage was *because* it was such a political force--ranking medieval clerics were all nobles themselves, and they wanted a say in who got married, reproduced, and had either money or children to donate to the Church). Generally, parents either had potential spouses for their children picked out long in advance--the Church set a lower bound on *betrothal* age to 7, but it was basically ignored--or had to conduct extensive diplomatic campaigns to find a good political match...to whom the child was not already related.Nevertheless, the *idea* that a lord could and would seduce/rape a lowly born woman was a mainstay of medieval literary imagination, as well as our picture of the Middle Ages today. The medieval lyric genre of pastourelles, popularized by the troubadour poets in 12th century France but with enduring popularity throughout western Europe, offered a counterpart to the (ideally) unconsummated courtly love tradition of noble lovers who (ideally) cannot physically demonstrate their love.In pastourelles, a knight or other aristocratic character traveling across the countryside happens upon a country girl, prototypically a shepherdess. Verbal sparring ensues. Sometimes she proves the superior wit and he passes on his way; sometimes she consents and they have sex; sometimes she refuses and he rapes her. Just as courtly romances teased the lure of the forbidden--the king's queen, the other knight's wife that you mustn't dare touch--pastourelles played upon the same thrill of the unfulfilled-by-its-audience forbidden.Today, we are more familiar with the *jus primae noctis* or the more picturesque French term *droit de cuissage*, \"right to the thigh\", above all from that most accurate of medieval documentaries *Braveheart*. In this schema, medieval lords had the perfectly legal and ecclesiastically-approved right to have sex with any serf woman on her wedding night (the \"first night\" or prima nox). As noted above, this was in fact not legal or moral. So how did we get here?There are some 14th century sources from the Low Countries to the effect that if a male serf chooses to marry a woman from another lord's dominion, and consequently bring her to live with him, *his* lord must compensate the other lord for the loss of her labor. This makes reasonable sense as an actual medieval practice.But by 1500, this has become canon lawyer Nicolas Boyer's exquisite phrase, \"the lords of Gascony had the right to place a bare leg across the newlyweds\u2019 bed.\" In other 16th century references, the \"right\" is claimed by lords in different parts of France, pertains to male or female serfs variously, and--tellingly--is noted as \"obscene\" with the specific mention that such a practice has now, in a more civilized age, been replaced with lavish feasting.We still turn to this myth today, with works from Braveheart to (sadly, because it's an amazing book) Pillars of the Earth using *droit de cuissage* as a way to denote the shocking brutality and evilness of certain characters--and by extension, the era that permits their actions. But in that way, anchoring the practice of this form of systematized violence against women so firmly in the *past* has allowed us us--from the age that saw themselves as the *renaissance* of civilization, to today--to step back and say, We are not like that. We are better; we are civilized.", "label": 0}, {"content": "In medieval Europe, a serf was a person who worked for a landowner in exchange for a small plot of land.

It reads smoothly and is forgiving if you're new to the subject. For this answer, I'm also going to draw upon Holzer's *Lincoln at Cooper Union*, the new version of *How We Elected Lincoln* by Dittenhoefer and University of Pennsylvania Press, and various other papers. The book that most directly answers your question would probably be Mark Neely's *The Boundaries of American Political Culture in the Civil War Era,* but I unfortunately don't have a copy handy, so I have to do without.I'm also going to focus specifically on the election of 1860 and largely disregard 1864, a wartime election unlike any other in American history.But to answer your question, Lincoln's campaign was funded not dissimilarly to campaigns today. **It was underwritten in almost total part by wealthy Republicans and the party establishment. Lincoln also benefitted personally from speaking fees.** Lincoln's campaign also benefitted (to what degree is in question) from the activities of the \"Wide Awakes,\" tens of thousands of young, white men who contributed small amounts to one particular side campaign that I will explain later. The vast majority of campaign contributions, Neely asserts, were performed in-kind, rather than financial.With regard to the party establishment, keep in mind that being a Republican office holder (or office holder of any party, for that matter), tended to come with obligations to contribute to the campaigns of other party figures. Republican governors in 1860, for example, were *encouraged* to contribute to the Lincoln campaign. In 1864, for example, members of Lincoln's cabinet were required to pay $250 apiece for the printing of presidential campaign documents, Neely writes.There were no organized political action committees, and Lincoln made only one speech during the campaign season \u2500 on Aug. 8, 1860 in Springfield, Illinois \u2500 but Lincoln's campaign manager, David Davis, used many of the tricks you'd be familiar with. He squeezed Republican donors, underwrote reporting trips by newspapers and freelance writers, paid for parades and conventions, and organized a series of speakers to travel the country and promote Lincoln.Davis, whom Egerton describes as a \"land baron,\" was supported by Thurlow Weed, the New York City political boss. Weed had supported Seward as the Republican candidate, but when that man dropped out of the race, he threw his support behind Lincoln starting in late May 1860. Where Davis had connections in the West (today's Midwest), Weed was connected in the East.As Egerton writes on page 182: > \"The two fired off requests for financial assistance to Republican governors and philanthropists. Davis then funneled the cash into closely contested states. Although some of the missives directed to Lincoln himself asked for money, the candidate passed them along to Davis, so Lincoln never saw budgets, expense vouchers, or even explanations of where the cash was going. When Caleb B. Smith of Indianapolis complained to Davis about the likelihood of illegal voting in Kentucky, the judge contacted an old friend and former Whig congressman, John Goodrich of Massachusetts, who responded with a grant of ten thousand dollars to combat the alleged fraud.\"At the Springfield speech in August, Davis organized special trains that funneled more than 50,000 people into the city. The parade he organized was a gala affair, with a series of log cabins on wheels, pulled by oxen. When Lincoln arrived at the stage, the enthusiasm was so great that the crowd pulled Lincoln out of his carriage and carried him onto the stage. Davis made sure plenty of reporters were there to capture the scene.As Egerton writes, \"Across the North, political machines constructed in advance by Davis and Weed raised money, funded speakers, and mailed out pamphlets and biographies of Lincoln.\"Far behind in fundraising, Democratic candidate Stephen Douglas broke new ground in American presidential politics by deciding to campaign on his own behalf. He didn't have the monetary backing that Lincoln had, so he decided to hit the road and hope his stage presence would carry the day. Republicans in New England responded by posting a series of handbills seeking help for \"A Boy Lost!\"The handbills described the lost boy as \"about five feet nothing in height and answers the same in diameter the other way. Has an idea that he is a candidate for President.\"Now, let's take a look at a particular event, Lincoln's Cooper Union speech of Feb. 27, 1860. Lincoln had not yet won the Republican nomination for the presidency, but he was widely believed to be a frontrunner for the convention scheduled in May. As such, he was very much in demand as a speaker. He had been planning a trip east from Illinois to see his son, Robert Lincoln, and the organizers of the speech had promised him an honorarium of $200, according to Holzer's *Lincoln at Cooper Union.*As Holzer explains, \"Lectures offered Lincoln the opportunity to speak on a wide variety of topics, demonstrate intellectual breadth, attract new audiences, travel to places where he could enlist new political allies, and earn additional money in the bargain.\"In New York City, Lincoln was more concerned about the political capital he would earn from the Cooper Union speech, rather than the financial capital. During his time in New York, he laid the groundwork for much of his later support in the nation's wealthiest city. He visited Astor House, took a tour of Broadway, and met with important figures. There is a persistent (if questionable) story that after his Cooper Union speech that Lincoln was offered a $10,000 per year job as a corporate lawyer, but turned it down, saying that having so much money would ruin him.Lincoln, as did most presidential candidates of the time, chose to run behind the scenes, with intermediaries doing most of the work. His lecturing work (before becoming an official candidate) allowed him to implement the groundwork necessary for a political campaign.Now, we've talked about the \"big men\" side of things, so let's turn to the individual level. Lincoln's campaign was assisted by the \"Wide Awakes,\" a young, militaristic movement in the North that arose partly out of support for Republican ideals and partly as a reaction to the militia movement alive in the South during this period.As Jon Grinspan writes in a 2009 paper, \"Young Men for War\" > \"Young men from Bangor to San Francisco and from huge Philadelphia clubs to tiny Iowa troupes donned uniforms, lit torches, and \"fell in\" to pseudomilitary marching companies. They flooded every northern state and trickled into upper South cities like Baltimore, Wheeling, and St. Louis. Launched in March by \"five young dry goods clerks\" in Hartford, Connecticut, by November the Wide Awakes had developed into a nationwide grassroots movement with hundreds of thousands of members.\"While not directly supported by Lincoln's campaign (as far as we can tell), the campaign nonetheless enjoyed the support of this grassroots movement. Each member paid for his own uniform, torches and fuel (though some Democrats accused Republican officials of secretly funding the campaign) and volunteered his time for marching, games and other activities.While generally nonviolent, the Wide Awakes alarmed the South, which had long had its own militia movement to use as a military hedge against a slave rebellion or a political hedge against Northern attempts to restrict slavery. One of the particular phrases that stands out is the accusation that the Wide Awakes were a \"monster body guard\" for Lincoln.As a movement, the Wide Awakes were attractive to young men interested in politics and rejecting the status quo. The Wide Awakes were something new and interesting, a way to make friends and make a difference, they believed. College campuses, particularly those in New England, were hotbeds of activity \u2500 even radical activity. Some clubs in Massachusetts included black men. In September, Elizabeth Cady Stanton presented a banner to her local Seneca Falls Wide Awake club, which returned the favor by performing military drills as a show on her lawn. She and guest Susan B. Anthony presented lectures at local club meetings.At its peak, the New York Herald estimated some 400,000 young white men were members of Wide Awake clubs, who were connected through newsletters and activities to clubs across the North and border states. Evidence of grassroots fundraising for the campaign directly is somewhat limited. Neely points to an 1860 notice in the Philadelphia newspaper the *Public Ledger* reporting \"a host of nice young men ... running about with books, soliciting aid in sums of almost any size.\"Neely asserts that these efforts were unsystematic and unplanned, however.", "label": 0}, {"content": "In the United States, politicians in the time of Abraham Lincoln funded their campaigns through private donations.

Previously, Mac OS and Windows used bitmap fonts for all parts of the interface.Microsoft released Windows version 3.1 in 1991, which came with a slew of features which were game-changing, like OLE, the Registry, common dialogs, and TrueType fonts. On OS 7, Apple released several TrueType fonts, among which were included Times Roman, Helvetica, and Courier.

In the years immediately following the Bolshevik Revolution, there was a belief within Russia and among socialists internationally that Russia's revolution would trigger others around the world. Until the end of World War II, however, there were only two communist nations in the world: the Soviet Union and Mongolia.In 1921, Mongolia had been overrun by the Red Army and a protectorate was installed. As the Mongolian People's Republic, it became in 1924 the world's second communist state. Officially it was independent, an example of the revolution exported. In fact, it was a Soviet satellite not dissimilar to those seen in eastern Europe following WWII.From the 1920s through his death in 1952, Mongolia was ruled by Horloogiyn Choybalsan, who slavishly followed Stalin's example and earned the title \"Stalin of Mongolia.\" Mongolia was predominantly agricultural, but that didn't stop Choybalsan from instituting a series of five-year industrial plans akin to those of the Soviet Union.In 1946, in negotiations with Stalin, Chiang Kai-Shek obtained an understanding whereby China would recognize Mongolia as an independent country. It was an attempt to convince Stalin to keep Mao's communist Chinese forces in check, and internal documents reveal that it may have worked: Stalin encouraged Mao to stay in northern China and not press into the south, the better, perhaps, to create an easily controllable puppet. Mao didn't listen, of course.As an independent country rather than part of the Soviet Union, Mongolia was the Soviet Union's useful tool for trade and diplomacy. Though landlocked, it could participate in international relations and give the Soviet Union an easily controllable voice in that theater. Mongolia's largest trading partner was the Soviet Union, and some evidence of the closeness between the two countries can be found in the fact that soon after the fall of the Soviet Union, Mongolia's communist government followed suit.The last sentence of the 1979 constitution of the Mongolian People's Republic states: \"In the MPR, the guiding and directing force of society and of the state is the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, which is guided in its activities by the all-conquering theory of Marxism-Leninism.\"For more reading on this topic, see Milan Hauner's *What is Asia to Us?

Under the Englandspiel, the German intelligence service, the Abwehr were able to capture many of the agents SOE and MI6 dropped into the Netherlands, as the Abwehr was using messages sent by turned SOE agents to arrange their drop zones. This was not the first time a British intelligence operation in Holland had gone awry, as two MI6 agents had been kidnapped in the Dutch town of Venlo in 1939, as described by /u/Abrytan. The first part of the Englandspiel began in August-September 1941. An MI6 agent was captured, along with his radio set and enough coded and decoded messages for the Germans to work out the cipher system he was using. The Germans attempted to use this to set up a 'funkspiel' (radio game) to deceive the Allies, but were missing key security checks and so MI6 disregarded their messages. In February 1942, another MI6 radio operator was captured along with his radio. Under torture, he agreed to send messages to Britain for the Germans. In sending these messages, he too would omit the security codes (these were intentional mistakes inserted into messages to show the sender was not under duress) and MI6 again disregarded his messages. In March 1942, SOE radio operator Huub Lauwers was captured in the Hague. Herman Giskes, head of counter-intelligence for the Abwehr in the Netherlands, managed to persuade him to work for the Germans, using the knowledge of British codes gained from the previously captured agents, and the threat of torture. SOE agents were also instructed to work with German counter-intelligence, as long as they left out their security checks; this kept the agent alive and well, and ensured SOE was not misled. Lauwers thus sent a number of messages to SOE for the Germans, omitting the security checks. SOE, however, ignored the missing checks, believing the messages to have been garbled on reception in London, common with the low-power radios issued to SOE agents. Using this chain of communications, the Germans were able to capture a number of agents dropped into Holland to meet with Lauwers.At a similar time, the Abwehr was able to capture members of another SOE cell operating in the Netherlands. Agents from this cell would also work with the Abwehr. This essentially gave the Germans full control over SOE's activities in Holland. Both Lauwers and Jordaan (the radio operator from this cell) would attempt to warn SOE of their capture, both by using incorrect or omitted security checks and by including concealed messages about their capture in the ancillary information to their main messages. All were disregarded by SOE.The Germans used these radio channels to arrange for new agents and equipment to be dropped in the Netherlands; these were promptly captured and used to further the Abwehr control of the SOE network in Holland. Radio operators were coerced into working with the Abwehr, while radios that were supposedly for newly recruited agents were instead handed over to German operators. The vast majority of SOE agents dropped into Holland in 1942-1943 were captured by the Abwehr as a result. The Germans were also able to use their captured agents to infiltrate a number of Dutch resistance groups.In 1943, though, suspicions started to arise in London. Dutch resistance leaders began to report that SOE agents had been captured. One of the fictional agents supposedly recruited by the SOE organisation in the Netherlands was apparently a former worker for the Dutch Secret Service, but there was no record of him in London. In November 1943, two of the captured SOE agents managed to escape from captivity and return to the UK.

Let's first consider the strictest possible definition of a paper airplane: **a toy glider made *only* out of folded paper**. The technology of papermaking has its origins in East Asia, so a good place to start is examine the history of Asian paper folding. However, we run quickly run into the problem that very little research has actually been done on topic of paper folding. One of the few detailed accounts of the history of Chinese paper folding is presented in Tsien Tsuen-hsuin's *Paper and Printing*, published in 1985 as part of Joseph Needham's seminal *Science and Civilisation in China* series. According to Tsien, the practice of paper folding (*zhezhi*) emerged in the Tang dynasty at the latest. This is based on decorative folded and cut paper flowers dated to the 9th-10th centuries, which are believed to be among the oldest surviving examples of paper folding as an artform. The paper flowers were discovered by Aurel Stein at the turn of the 20th century in Dunhuang, a city in western China, and are currently held by the [British Museum](_URL_3_). However, there are no mentions made of folded paper gliders. Tsien *does* discuss other paper toys, but we'll come to that later.Then what about paper folding in Japan? While the Japanese term *origami* has come to encompass all forms of paper folding, it may come as a  surprise that research into the history of Japanese paper folding is even more lacking. Most of the research into the  origins of origami comes from hobbyists and amateurs. This includes Koshiro Hatori's \"History of Origami in the East and the West before Interfusion\" published in 2011 and Isao Honda's *The World of Origami* published in 1965. Hatori traces the origins of origami to 14th century ceremonial paper folding such as *noshi* or *ocho*-*mecho*. These were used as wrappers; *noshi* derived from *noshi-awabi* containers for abalone meat and the *ocho*-*mecho* paper butterflies were meant to adorn bottles of alcohol. It doesn't take a huge leap to imagine that one of these early origami designs was capable of gliding through the air, even if accidentally, but that was not their intended purpose.We've apparently reached dead end. So let's use a looser definition for a paper airplane: **a toy or device made of paper (but not necessarily just paper) that is capable of flight**. There are several military devices that fit this description. /u/cthulhushrugged has already discussed the *[shen huo fei ya](_URL_2_)* (\"magic-fire flying crow\"), which was a bird-shaped bomb with a body made from bamboo that was covered in paper using an adhesive. Placed under the wings of the artificial bird were arrows propelled using gunpowder.Outside of warfare, there are several pre-modern flying paper toys that are worth mentioning. Flying kites made of paper were used by the Chinese in circa 549 at the latest, when there is an account of a paper kite being used for signalling during a rescue attempt. The first mention of flying a kite as a recreational activity (and not for military or measurement purposes) comes much later in the 10th century, from a passage in the *Xun chu lu* that describes a person attaching a kite to a bamboo to produce music using moving air currents. These kites were designed with the paper covering a bamboo frame. Prior to the invention of paper, materials such as silk would have likely been used instead. There were even kites made large enough to supposedly lift a person.In China, there are also paper lanterns that fly by heating the air inside the lantern with a candle, similar to how a hot air balloon works. The history of these flying *tian deng* lanterns is murky at best, but (non-flying) paper lanterns were popular at least by the Tang dynasty. This dating is based on a book discovered in Khotan that references paper being bought for the purpose of making lanterns.But why limit ourselves to paper? We might as well adopt an even more flexible definition: **Any toys capable of flight.** /u/AshkenazeeYankee mentioned George Cayley, whose \"rotary waft\" experiments were inspired by the  \"Chinese tops\" popular in 18th century Europe. In China, these tops were made from bamboo rather than folded paper. They were \"helicopter tops\" that would fly off after spinning their axis by hand. The origins of this toy are unknown, but the connection of the helicopter top to the Mongol prayer-wheel and Chinese zoetrope has been speculated by Needham.Going back to our strict definition of paper airplanes\u2014toy gliders made of folded paper\u2014we don't *really* starting seeing literary references to these types of paper airplanes until the 19th century. /u/AshkenazeeYankee has already cited Charles Matthews' memoirs from 1860. There's also a line about a \"broker [who] cannot... innocently fling a \u2018paper dart\u2019 at a neighbour without being amerced ten dollars\" from James Knowles Medbery's *Men and Mysteries of Wall Street* from 1870. These \"paper darts\" predate the invention of airplane. However, this does not necessarily imply that there were no premodern paper airplanes that are even older; that may just be a result of the lack of research done on the history of paper folding.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The first paper airplanes were made in the early 1900s.

An idea such a truth to materials is simply something that the general public don't care about, and it's not until you consider this that the unfinished look of the concrete used starts to make sense. The 'make it new' aspect of it, as well as its utopianism (dystopianism if you don't like it, I guess) I think led to it being used in places that wanted to suggest a break with the past and a newfound modernity. It's also worth noting that it's a style that simply could not have existed without the development of new building materials in the C20th, which is also an attractive feature if you are interested in it as a Modernist form.There has been over the past few years a reappraisal of the style led by Owen Hatherley in the UK which has led to many of these buildings becoming listed and redeveloped.

Any words about what Alexander wanted are at one remove from Alexander, even at the best of times.Even in India (3-4 years before his death), there is debate about how personally ambitious Alexander was and to what extent his ambition conflicted with the desires of his army.  Most historians believe that Alexander knew that he had already conquered the Persian Empire by the time that he was passing through the Hindu Kush.  By this time, Alexander was in pursuit of the \"encircling river\", because it was only upon reaching this that he could confirm that all eastern threats had submitted.  This ambition seems fairly likely.  The fact that he stopped before finding this encircling river has suggested that upon reaching the River Beas, Alexander conceded to the demands of his fatigued and demoralised army.  Alexander took his army down the Indus river, and by 325 was set on returning to Babylon.  Yet this might not have been the end of Alexander's desires for expansion.  Waldemar Heckel has made arguments both about the trip down the Indus and about the return to Babylon.  Going down the Indus, he argues, was the best way to further pacify the region (Alexander did fight the Mallian campaign whilst travelling).  Then the arrival at Babylon was a way of centralising government so that preparations for another expedition could be as smooth as possible.  This view therefore attaches Alexander's apparent refocus upon governing with a continued, if latent, desire for campaigning.  Whichever view you find more compelling, you should also notice that this is an inconclusive and largely abstract debate about *what Alexander's personal vision was for a campaign he had been pursuing for over a decade*.  Needless to say, there was no further movements upon India, and Hellenic influence over India deteriorated very quickly.  Alexander died soon after returning to Babylon and there are two documents that claim to contain what Alexander was planning on his deathbed.  [A Last Will is recorded in the Alexander Romance \\(3.33\\)](_URL_0_).  This Will allocates satrapies, decrees reimbursement for Thebes, and establishes funeral arrangements.  The Alexander Romance is enormously suspect: it is a composite document, it is quasi-fictional, and Heckel has rejected the Will as a forgery.  [You can read the other document, the Last Plans, here.](_URL_1_)  I am not sure how credible Diodorus is as a historian of Alexander, but  Stoneman says that none of the claims here are too outrageous to be believed.  Indeed, if Alexander's \"pothos\" was undiminished after the shortcomings in India, it is not unlikely that Arabia or Carthage were next on the list.  The temples and tombs are not uncharacteristic and seem congruent with Alexander's obsession with piety and Homeric mythology.  Perhaps the most controversial is the claim that Alexander desired migration and miscegenation between east and west.  At least part of the reason that this point has been so controversial is that it appears to be the most relevant to the debate previously mentioned - over how far Alexander was going to go to secure his lands before another expedition.  But even if we accept these Last Plans as true, you should be able to see that, much like with India, even if we know the policies that Alexander had, it is very difficult to put our finger on motivations.  The migrations could have been desired because of realist security concerns, because of some idealistic \"Brotherhood of Man\", because of Alexander's \"orientalising tendency\", or perhaps even other reasons.  There really is not enough evidence to say.  It seems to me that many conclusions on this matter are made based on what seems most fitting to the historian's interpretation of Alexander's overall character, and this is something that has been noticeably fluid over the centuries.Main sources are, once again, a textbook by Richard Stoneman.  The arguments by Heckel are in a paper \"Alexander's Conquest of Asia\" and in his book \"The Last Days and Testament of Alexander the Great\".

Kenneth Woodward, in his *Making Saints*, notes that \"many cases do not succeed\" \u2013 but since judgement is rendered on an overall case, comprising many documents other than the arguments of the Devil's Advocate, and since no commentary is issued on the judgements that are rendered, it is impossible to be sure whether any cases have been rejected explicitly as a result of the Advocate's work. In addition, while the prospective candidate for sainthood has already passed several other tests by the point his case reaches the pope for final approval, and while the Advocate's material is the only explicitly negative portion of the documentation that remains, the decision is the pontiff's \u2013 and a reigning pope is perfectly entitled to take account of some other, unstated, factor not contained in the process documents in rendering a judgement.Breaking all this down a little further, it's important to recognise two things. First, the lawyer popularly known as the Devil's Advocate was not literally some evil *agent provocateur* seeking to throw a spanner in the works of the church establishment; rather, he was a key bastion of orthodoxy, whose official title was actually Promoter of the Faith, and whose role was to help ensure the worthiness of candidates for sainthood. Secondly, while the procedure created by the church to assess such cases (which was in place from 1587 until its abolition under John Paul II in 1983) was adversarial \u2013 with the Devil's Advocate debating with an advocate for the candidate for sainthood \u2013 the role of the Promoter of the Faith was only one part of a much larger process. His advocacy, moreover, was never conducted in the form of an actual trial. Rather, the two advocates pitched written arguments back and forth, often over a period of decades, seeking to hone their arguments regarding the case before them.The two advocates taking part in this stage of the canonisation process (called the Ordinary Process) were supplied with materials assembled by the local bishop, who was charged - as a first step - with collecting evidence and with determining that the candidate was not the object of a public cult. For several hundred years, the next stage in the process was for this evidence to be reviewed by censors for any evidence of unorthodox teachings or of heresy; it seems certain that far more prospective saints were disbarred as a result of these two steps than were ever failed by the work of the Devil's Advocate. One example is Jean-Jacques Olier, the 17th century French founder of the Society of Saint-Sulpice, who was proceeding slowly towards canonisation in the 19th century when a publication of his containing unorthodox views on the Virgin Mary was uncovered. Olier's process was immediately halted. Since 1940, the advocates of a candidate for sainthood also have to obtain a declaration of *nihil obstat* (\"nothing objectionable\") from Rome, which is based on a search of the files of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith \u2013 the group responsible for maintaining the well-known *Index Librorum Prohibitorum*, or list of banned books.The adversarial phase in which the Devil's Advocate participated began after these checks. It started with the selection of a \"postulator\", a lawyer who would argue the prospective saint's cause, who was selected from a group of canon lawyers (still in existence and currently around 200 strong) recognised by the Congregation. The postulator, in turn, selected his own Devil's Advocate from among a smaller group of around two dozen lawyers licensed by the Holy See to handle such cases. Both men received copies of the materials produced by the local bishop, examined them, and began to engage in a dialectic, which might, as noted above, go on for decades, but which eventually produced a printed *positio* which incorporated the materials produced by the bishop and the key arguments of both advocates. It was this *positio* that was considered by the cardinals and prelates associated with the canonisation process, and which went to the pope for approval. But this was not (and is not) the end of the process. Cases that passed this initial test went into a new \"Apostolic Process\" in which the office of the Promoter of the Faith drew up a new set of queries relating to the virtues of the candidate, which had to be considered by a new tribunal held in the candidate's diocese. This collected additional evidence - from eyewitnesses where possible - which was sent back to Rome and used in the preparation of a new document, the *informatio*, which systematically laid out the case. The Devil's Advocate and the advocate for the putative saint would again register points for and against the candidate, based this time on examination of the *informatio*, which would again be printed, and would again be studied by the Congregation; and this entire process was repeated three times, with the advocates on either side getting repeated opportunities to advance new arguments and respond to existing ones. The pope himself would take part in the third of these exchanges, and only candidates who received the final approval of the pontiff could proceed.But even that was not the end of the procedure - those candidates who survived examination of their credentials still had to go through the processes of beatification and then canonisation, meaning that between two and four miracles had to be attributed to them and accepted as genuine as a result of separate studies by the *Consulta Medica*, a tribunal of Catholic doctors tasked with assessing evidence assembled to show that a reported cure could not be anything but miraculous. In addition, beatification was subject to a final sign off which might be, and sometimes was, put on hold if the candidature was politically sensitive (for example, in the case of a martyr who had died at the hands of a regime that was still in power by the time he or she came up for consideration). Typically there has always been a further delay between beatification and canonisation, during which more miracles are required to occur. Since the late 19th century, the act of canonisation itself has been made by infallible decree of the pontiff, meaning that it is not something that can ever be reconsidered or withdrawn.Finally, it seems incontestable that the pontiff takes a key role not only in the process of canonisation, but also in the selection and acceptance of candidates, and can steamroll the entire process if he wishes \u2013 as John Paul II did in 2002 in the case of Juan Diego Cuauhlatoatzin, the main actor in the supposed visions of the Virgin Mary that took place at Guadalupe in Mexico in the early 16th century. There is considerable doubt as to whether Juan Diego actually existed at all, so his canonisation is good evidence that the elaborate process set out above is, at least in certain circumstances, more window-dressing than serious investigation in any case. So is the dramatic increase in the number of beatifications and canonisations dealt with by John Paul II, who not only abolished the devil's advocate's role but also, in the course of his 27-year reign, approved the candidacies of more people than all other popes put together since the modern system was created in the 17th century. So, arguably, is the controversial canonisation of Josemar\u00eda Escriv\u00e1, founder of [Opus Dei](_URL_0_), which was at least in part the product of the investment of significant resources in creating and arguing his case by the members of his own order.Still, all in all, the process of canonisation has been, more often than not, a very protracted one (Benedict XIV, in the 18th century, set the timescale as a minimum of 100 years, a ruling that is no longer in effect; John Paul II was canonised in 2014, only nine years after his death). It's one in which the Devil's Advocate played an important but far from central role. Candidates for sainthood might fall out of the process at any time, for a variety of reasons, and while successful objections lodged by the Promoter of the Faith are certainly one possible cause of the failure of a candidacy, such failures were never formally announced as such.**Sources**John L.

The earliest manuscript we have of the Gospel of John, the Bodmer Papyri, can be dated to around 150AD by the earliest estimates^1 and John was probably one of those composed the latest (as can be devised for example by its highly allegorical content with numerous references to the rest of the Jewish corpus, suggesting the emergence of a Christian theology, beyond a simple account of the life of Christ). It is also generally considered that Mark is the book that was composed the earliest, usually dated around 70AD^2. There are indications that most Gospels either were composed by eyewitnesses of the last years of Christ's life and teaching, or people who had known such eyewitnesses (in 66-70AD as Perkins dates Mark, there would have been such elderly eyewitnesses in early Christian communities). There are also indications of a far broader profusion of writings, of which we have kept some *apocryphal* gospels and books of revelations, between 50AD and 200AD (Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Judas, Gospel of Barnabas) with a wide spectrum of relatively orthodox (from a later point of view) writings to gnostic heterodox writings. In any case, early Christianity was from the onset based on written accounts of the life of Christ and his teachings, and developped in preexisting cultures that put an extremely high emphasis on *written* teachings, both the Jewish culture of the time, which already placed a high importance on the written world of God, and the Hellenistic culture, which, while holding specific deference for spoken rational discourse (*logos*) had an extremely refined scholarly tradition. As such, later Christians, continuing in the Middle Ages, considered Scripture as, well, something written (rather than something memorized or said) -- Scripture comes from the Latin *scribo, is, ere, ipsi, iptum*, to write, to note in written form. The Good Book, is also, importantly, called the *Bible* (from the greek *biblion*, a book in written form).On the contrary, early Islam did not emerge in a culture with such an emphasis on written teaching and scholarly comment but in a culture where a significant part of the population was nomadic, illiterate, and where most cultural transmission came orally. It is particularly telling that \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0631\u0622\u0646\u200e al-Qur\u02be\u0101n litterally means \"the recitation\" (and not the book, or anything meaning that it is supposed to be written). An important meaning of this word is in particular the \"act of reciting\", as reflected in an early Quranic passage: \"It is for Us to collect it and to recite it (qur\u02bc\u0101nahu).\" (Quran, 75:17). There are, nonetheless indications that written depictions of Muhammad's teachings were kept quite early on : tradition holds it that the first of them was composed on orders of Abu Bakr, somewhere around 650AD (within 20 years of Muhammad's death in 632), and palimpsests were found in Yemen almost as early as Muhammad^3. There is also broad consensus that around these very first early written accounts (that would become the core of the Quran) most transmission went on orally, by people who had memorized parts of the early islamic teachings and sayings of Muhammad and his companions, and kept teachings of wisdom that were (much later) compiled as Hadith. In any case, there was a greater space for oral transmission in this context : islamic tradition considers that the oral memorization by hundreds of followers was essential to retaining perfect fidelity to the revelation as given by God to Muhammad.Also do bear in mind that the Quran is composed as something relatively poetic or at least rythmic in nature, with the idea that it should be cantillated (not really sung per se, but a pattern of intonation that allows easier memorization). The gospels absolutely do not have this specificity, and would be much harder to memorize. From a purely pedagogical standground, medieval clergy did not rely on musical / rythmical methods to memorize religious texts but gave significant emphasis to spatial mnemotechniques first mentionned by Cicero in the *De Oratore* (the famous *mind palace* popularized by *Sherlock*), often using the depictions of the Temple of Jerusalem or of the Celestial Jerusalem in Revelations as the structure of their internal memories (hence why this spatial organization would be everywhere in monasteries)^4.In conclusion : Christianity does not put the same emphasis on rote memorization and recitation of holy texts, and had, much earlier, a strong emphasis on written form and commentary. The Christian Holy Books were not composed to that end, and do not have the rythmic nature which allows for memorization of islamic teachings. To add on this, Medieval Christianity did not emphasize memorization based on melodies and/or rythmic patterns as Hafiz learning would, but relied much more on spatial memorization techniques.------^1 : Herbert Hunger. \"Zur Datierung des Papyrus Bodmer II (P66),\" *Anzeiger der \u00d6sterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften philosophisch-historische Klasse 97* (1961)^2 : Perkins, Pheme (1998). *\"The Synoptic Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles: Telling the Christian Story\".

I'll concentrate on medieval armor maintenance, since that's what I'm familiar with.* Prevention- The predominant ways of preventing metal from rusting are the same (or at least broadly very similar in principle to) modern means of combating rust, coating the surface of the metal with some sort of protective layer. This could be decorative enamel/lacquer/paints, or layers of tin/cloth. Waxes and oils were most common for protecting the surfaces of metal equipment, and would have to be reapplied with use, since every scratch was a new area for rust to take hold.* Treatment- the most common way to remove rust was a sand and vinegar scrub, basically sanding. Things like mail shirts would be rolled in a barrel of the mixture, and rust on plates would be removed by hand. It's also worth noting that mail armor can be considered self cleaning if properly oiled, since it moves while worn it will scrub itself on whatever garment it's worn over. Usually a padded gambeson, the thick linen coat worn by poor foot soldiers as their primary protective gear, (besides a possible helmet) and by armored troops as protection against penetration of their metal armor, and chafing from the plate/mail.* Responsibility for treatment - rich nobles had armorers to care for their equipment, for a someone ad important as the Holy Roman Emperor, or a king like Henry VIII, that could be a whole workshop that ~~bulky~~ *built* and maintained the armor. Knights or other minor nobility would have squires and pages whose responsibilities included caring for their lord's armor, as well as their own. Squires often fought beside knights in the same fashion as heavy infantry or lance armed cavalry until they reached the status of a full knight. If you were a common foot soldier, you were likely responsible for your own equipment's upkeep, like modern soldiers in the field.

Following the disastrous defeats at Midway and Guadalcanal, the war was clearly lost for Japan.  In the US bombing raids, 67 Japanese cities suffered great damage resulting in several hundred thousand Japanese deaths and making about 5 million Japanese homeless.  Most Japanese citizens at this point understood they were losing and trusted that their leaders would give up at a reasonable point.  This sentiment is echoed in many Japanese oral histories.  What is perhaps unique about Japan is the degree in which citizens embraced the idea of sacrifice to the nation.  Housewives drilled with bamboo spears to prepare to attack any invading American forces, students were drafted to manufacture balloon bombs, which would travel in the prevailing winds to the Continental US.  Another idea that is echoed in the oral histories of these individuals is that normal citizens felt obligated to sacrifice for the nation, as the front line soldiers had it worse.  The Japanese Press was instrumental in instilling these attitudes in the Japanese people, but the Japanese were generally eager to assist the nation in whatever small, desperate way they could.  To me, Kamikaze pilots exemplified the Japanese trait of sacrificing for the nation more than any.  In interviews years later, pilots who were never sent on their suicidal attack flights noted that they were terrified of dying, but they were willing to if it meant saving Japan.The Emperor and other leaders in Japan hoped for a more advantageous peace with the US which would guarantee protections for the emperor and prevent an occupation, hopefully with the Soviet Union acting as a mediator.  After the atomic bombs dropped and the Soviet Union entered the war, this was no longer possible and Japan was forced to accept allied terms of unconditional surrender.Sources:A wonderful documentary on the Kamikaze Pilots: Wings of DefeatBix.

They were *events* in a very profound way. When the Mongols conquered Song China, it was not a matter of two armies meeting on a field, one winning, and thus becoming emperor, rather it was a decades long, titanic struggle that ranged across southern China, and was followed by further decades resistance. One might imagine great hardship suffered by those who lived in the path of the armies, as well as hardship (and opportunity!) that went along with the general breakdown of civic order. Chinese historiography had sort of conventions of describing these periods of transition, and even if we don't necessarily accept that cannibals roamed the land it is pretty clear that the events reverberated throughout society.One problem with answering the question in detail is that China is  a very large, very diverse sort of place, and when you start getting more granular in your analysis you also arguably get less representative. That aside, there is a very good work on this very topic called *Crimson Rain* by William T Rowe, which traces the history of single place, Macheng County in Hubei, throughout its history, with the bulk dedicated to the late Ming and early Qing. To start with a big picture, the fall of the Ming was not precisely a \"conquest\"--starting in the 1630s a number of peasant rebellions began springing up, mostly in the south, and grew dramatically in the 1640s, particularly under two different leaders, Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong. To make a very long story short, the Manchus only got past the wall because Wu Sangui, the commander of a key fortress, decided he preferred them to the peasant armies, and Beijing fell to Li Zicheng, not Nurhaci (likewise, it was primarily Wu's armies that defeated Li). The actual consolidation of China would not come until 1671, after decades of war and peace.Macheng was uncomfortably close to the action during the peasant revolts, and Zhang Xianzhong actually marched his army through the county (albeit with minimal depredation, as a local notable had been kind to him in the past, so the story goes). But even when the fighting was not directly in the borders, the breakdown of the imperial structure impacted daily life. In articular, the local elite turned to fortifying themselves in the hills, and the pervading social tensions of the place broke out into open conflict, including outright rebellion by bondservants (essentially serfs). In particular, banditry (which should probably be seen here as a form of social conflict rather than simply rapaciousness) became commonplace, and individual bandits formed an impressive degree of military power. The larger conflicts engulfing the empire were reflected in local conflicts, which may have had local causes and roots but took the form they did due to the greater history of the empire. And of course some places (although not many) were even worse off than Macheng. When Zhang Xianzhong found his progress stymied in central China he marched to Sichuan, where he essentially committed a genocide against the Sichuanese.EDIT: It also occurs to me that you might be thinking more long term. In Macheng's case, there was a great difference between the Ming and he Qing. During the Ming, the county was famous for being a fertile source of degree holding officials, during the Qing it was something of a backwater. Rowe speculates hat the violence of the transition and new social formation that emerged from it are at least somewhat to blame.There is a saying in China that \"the mountain is high, and the emperor far away\" which basically means that the edicts of the imperial center only go so far in local affairs, and this is true enough. But this does not mean that local life was isolated from wider events in the empire. The history of a given place may be of that place, but that doesn't mean it does not get shaped and conditioned by wars and deaths and policies of the center.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Yuan and Ming dynasties were a part of the Chinese imperial system, which was a system of government that lasted for over a thousand years.

European presence on the Cape of Good Hope goes back centuries, from the first Portuguese in the late 1400s to the Dutch and then finally the English. There were many small-scale instances of contact and, indeed, many South African tribes and nations interacted with foreigners on different timescales. By the time the British took over the Cape Colony from the Dutch, many of the Khoi peoples had already been absorbed or assimilated (becoming the precursors to the Coloured ethnic group in South Africa and the Baster ethnic group in Namibia). Then there were a series of wars between the British and the most powerful kingdoms that refused to kneel to British sovereignty -- the major ones were the Frontier Wars fought against the Xhosa (starting in 1779 and continuing for the next century or so) and the Anglo-Zulu War (circa 1879). At some instance within this time period, the nations of South Africa would have begun to get a picture of the true size of the British Empire.In my judgment, the precise moment can be pinpointed to somewhere within the 1850s. Among the Xhosa, an apocalyptic religious movement headed by the girl Nongqawuse began preaching that the British were about to get their just desserts. People long dead would return to life, the strength of the Xhosa people would be restored, and their ancestors would lead everybody in a great campaign that would smash the power of the British in South Africa forever. The catch was that in order for this to happen, the Xhosa were supposed to slaughter all of their cattle (as a sign of faith or as a sacrifice -- because the Xhosa were decentralized in their leadership, different rulers interpreted this differently). The great Xhosa cattle-killing movement ended just as you'd expect, and while there is some thought that using this as a chance to draw together a fighting force of hardened, desperate warriors would have actually proved dangerous to the British had it been actually attempted (in essence, give your men no choice but to plunder in order to survive), by the end the Xhosa nation was completely broken and those who did wage war were swiftly crushed.Mark my words, the Xhosa were by no means stupid or ill-informed -- as much as Nongqawuse would be cursed by the survivors, her words were the culmination of a broader cultural movement in Xhosa society, and for awhile it seemed like her prophecies were actually playing out like she said they would. A lot of leaders who had previously been on the fence made the decision to begin slaughtering their cattle upon hearing news of the Crimean War, which was taking place half a world away. The fact that the Xhosa were able to follow this world event marks what I believe to be a critical watershed in the global awareness of the Xhosa people, although obviously some of the news was distorted by the distance it traveled.What does the Crimean War have to do with cattle-killing or the Xhosa? Well, according to Jeff Peires (*The Dead Will Arise: Nongqawuse and the Great Xhosa Cattle-Killing Movement of 1856-7*), Nongqawuse's prophesying about the return of ancestors to fight the British was interpreted in the context of Russian victories against the British in the Crimean War. To many Xhosa, the \"Russians\" were actually the Xhosa ancestors, and their war with the British was the first stage in the liberation of the Xhosa people. Many of the cattle-killing faction were therefore awaiting the arrival of black Russians in an armed body to assist them in their fight. Belief in the \"Russians are actually our martial ancestors\" theory increased after word reached the Cape about the death of George Cathcart, who had been an unpopular governor of the Cape Colony (unpopular to the Xhosa, at least) and who was killed by the Russians in the Crimean War.So if the Xhosa were not already aware of the size and scope of the British Empire, they probably had at least general knowledge of this by the 1850s. I cannot speak in detail about the Zulu or other South African peoples (perhaps a specialist on their history could help me out) but presumably they would've eventually found out what happened to the Xhosa.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Zulu and Xhosa were aware of the British Empire, but they were not aware of the size and scope of the British Empire. The Zulu and Xhosa were aware of the British Empire, but they were not aware of the size and scope of the British Empire.", "label": 1}, {"content": "Before I answer this I need to clear up a few misconceptions.  One of the primary misconceptions in the west is that the Kama Sutra is simply a sort of manual for tantric sex.  This is totally false from both perspectives.  The first, and perhaps most obvious issue with this is that the term Tantric is wrong in and of itself and completely anachronistic.  The Tantra as a movement includes a wide variety of esoteric ritual practices ranging from asceticism to mandala to, yes, sex, but of course this sex does not resemble sex done for pleasure in most cases and informs a greater ritual practice done for various reasons.  Furthermore, the Tantra as a movement emerged in the late Gupta period, sometime between 400 and 500 CE, some 200 to 500 years after the compilation of the Kama Sutra.  The second big misconception is that the Kama Sutra is simply a manual for sex.  This is part of the orientalist zeitgeist that surrounded its \"discovery\" by Europeans in the late nineteenth century, but in reality only one part of the greater work on Kama, or pleasure, one of the lower goals of Hindu society.Of course, this does not mean that sex and eroticism aren't an integral part of the work as a whole, as it crops up all over the chapters.  Eroticism, is given an ethical component as well, being called the \"touchstone of virtue\" and seen as part of the basis for the ethical lives of Hindus.  Sensuality is seen thus as a part of the spiritual path which culminates in the path to Moksha which is practiced when one leaves youth and thus leaves the lower goals of Kama behind. The idea that it is simply a sex manual or a guide to \"tantric sex\" is absolutely false.With those out of the way, we also need to discuss the historical providence of the work.  The Kama Sutra was compiled base almost entirely on earlier material in the 2nd or 3rd century by a man called Vatsyayana.  This period was a major shift in North Indian culture as the emergence of Puranic Hinduism was taking place and the cultural norms of Brahminism became more enforced, caste became immobile and more enforced.  Thus there was a renewed interest in the Brahminical law books, Shastras.  The Kama Sutra is, in essence, a Shastra rather than a Sutra in that it details how to behave and seek pleasure as a wealthy man in Indian society.The book is thus directed at these wealthy householders, Wealthy Brahmins, Kshatriya, and even upper Vaishya.  Of course, Brahmins especially were seen as needing to eschew Kama, being a lower desire, in order to achieve the higher Dharma, but for Kshatriya and Vaishya, it was seen as an integral part of the life of a householder along with his Dharma and his Artha.  Women too were expected to pursue Kama, in part for the sake of men, but also for themselves.Now for the juicy part, did people actually utilize the sexual positions on a regular basis?  The answer is yeah, probably.  Some of the more...interesting positions were likely pretty rare, but they were probably done at some point, but most of the positions listed are actually pretty common, at least in fantasy and imagination, but they way they are worded sounds exotic.  For instance, when I say,  \"There are ten kinds of bite,  known as: discreet  [gudhaka],  impressed  [ucchunaka],  pointed  [bindu],  necklace  of dots [bindu-mala],  coral jewel  [pravalamani], necklace  of gems [manimala],  scattered clouds  [khandabhraka],  the chewing of the  wild  boar  [varaha-charvita]...\" it sounds completely bizarre, but this simply lists places and ways to bite in an erotic manner, but the discreet bite is simply a light bite that doesn't leave marks where as the impressed and pointed leave marks in different ways,  and the necklace of dots is a number of hard bites in a line around the neck or sex.  This is far more common than people think today, according to the Kinsey institute, 50% of men and 55% of women report to an erotic response to biting and since this study was done in the 50's the data may have changed with contemporary reports placing BDSM activities far higher than the Kinsey institue's reports.  Furthermore, such depictions were not uncommon in erotic poetry in India, including the contemporary poetry of the Satavahanas.Of course, there are numerous positions that probably weren't practiced often, such as the \"Impalement\" pose where a woman continuously brings her foot over her lovers head while he places himself in front of her sex, but Vatsyayana remarks that these require practice or are uncommon.  It is also notable for depicting, without much dismissal, lesbian and male homosexual acts.  There are really no reason to doubt that these are anything but factual, as they, for the most part, do not go out of their way to demean the practice, despite attitudes towards homosexuality in classical India being largely negative.There is also depictions of these positions, while not in the work itself until the Mughal era, in sculpture and in relief on temples and the like.  This gives us visual evidence of the practice, even if here it was idealized as practiced by devas and yakshas and so on.  -------------------------------------------------------------------#Works citedBanerji, Sures Chandra.

The German leadership and Army as institutions and on the level of the vast majority of their individual members embraced a deeply misogynist, sexist, chauvinist, and patriarchal world-view that was \u2013 as toxic masculinity is wont to be \u2013 threatened and challenged by the existence of female soldiers of the Red Army. In lashing out against this threat, the women of the Red Army more often than not payed with their lives in that the Wehrmacht shot most of them after taking them prisoner. And if they survived, they were in addition to becoming the victims of massive sexual violence, not treated like their male compatriots but \u2013 if they survived \u2013 taken to Concentration Camps to be imprisoned there.The term the German Army used for female soldiers of the Red Army alone speaks volumes. In official documents of the Wehrmacht, rather than refer to them as \"Soldatinnen\" (female Soldiers) or \"Rotarmistinnen\" (female members of the Red Army), by far the most common term applied to them is \"Flintenweiber\" (Rifle Broad \u2013 \"Weib\" is a pejorative German term for a woman). While the exact origin of the term is unknown and lies most likely in the one of the popular wars (Volkskriege) of the 19th century, it was massively popularized in Germany, especially in a military context through the mass of Freikorps literature, describing the murderous activities of the German Freikorps after WWI fighting in the Baltics and Poland against the Soviets and the Polish state. German sociologist Klaus Theweleit has analyzed this type of literature as well as the members of the Freikorps for his book M\u00e4nnerphantasien, Munich 2000, originally published in 1977 and translated into English as Male Fantasies. Minneapolis 1987. Theweleit using concepts borrowed from Margaret Mahler, Wilhelm Reich, Deleuze and Foucault aims in essence at establishing the fascist male consciousness. Drawing on the literature written by Free Corps members and other later Nazis, Theweleit asserts that in part due to the highly militarized male culture of the time as well as the experiences that shaped the \"fascist male\", these men formed what he called a secondary ego in form of a body armor (imagine knights and not today's soldiers), which dictates military habitus, the inability to sustain normal human relations outside of a strict hierarchical environment, and libidinous world of aggression, meaning simply put a derival of pleasure from hatred and aggression. In essence, he purports that the gender norm of the male soldier of the time destroyed the ability of the Free Corps member and Nazi to empathize.Within this chauvinist and toxically masculine world-view, the Flintenweib represents the \"anti-man\", the greatest transgression of the existing and utopian patriarchal order. Women in the view of the fascist man fall stringently within a very strict \"virgin-whore\" dichotomy, meaning women are either \"worthless whores\" to be used for one's pleasure and then discarded after or \"virtuous virgins\" to be protected against the world. The women deemed Flintenweiber violate this dichotomy for by taking up the activity of soldering, wearing a uniform, fighting in the field \u2013 all activities highly coded male \u2013 they refuse to fall into any category within the accepted dichotomy of women. Their very existence is a violation and a threat to the order of gender in the patriarchy.Additionally, this perceived \"deviance\" was seen by the Freikorps and the German military as a direct result of the evils and degeneracy of Bolshevism. As Roger Marwick and Euridice Cardon write in their book about Soviet women on the front line of WWII: >  For Nazism, the deployment of women was confirmation of the moral bankruptcy of Bolshevism: \u2018a state that could sacrifice on the battlefield its most precious goods in this dissolute form was doomed\u2019. In keeping also with Hitler\u2019s injunction that the Eastern Front was a \u2018war of extermination\u2019 in which the summary execution of Jews, Communist commissars and partisans was obligatory, no quarter was to be given to the captured \u2018cruel\u2019, \u2018Jewish riflewoman\u2019, particularly female partisans. [...] Neither the wounded nor the dead were spared vicious desecration, sexual and otherwise. Such was the visceral fear, ferocity and hatred which women warriors provoked in the Nazified Wehrmacht. To the Nazi mind, Flintenweiber were \u2018not women but monsters \u2013 Russian fanatics\u2019 that embodied the unnatural barbarism of Bolshevism.What Marwick and Cardon call \"ruthless, lethal misogyny\" began to manifest virtually immediately with the invasion of the Soviet Union. On June 29, 1941, G\u00fcnther von Kluge, commander in chief of the German 4th Army, ordered his subordinates: \"Women in uniform are to be shot\". While a confirmation request of this policy by his intelligence officer with the Command of the Army (OKH) produced an order that rescinded this policy, this OKH response did not stop further generals and units instituting a similar policy. Walther von Reichenau, commander of the 6th Army, issued an infamous order \"on the treatment of Partisans, Flintenweiber and Political Commissars\" in October 1941 that stated that \"degenerate broads made into POWs\" were to be executed on the spot. Ernst hammer, commander of the 75th Infantry Division issued a similar order around the same time stating that \"womenfolk in Russian uniforms are to be shot immediately on principle\". The 4th Panzer Division had a similar order in effect also from October 1941 that said: \"Insidious and cruel partisans as well as degenerate Flintenweiber don't belong in a POW camp but hung from the nearest tree.\"These orders were willingly made reality by the German Wehrmacht and its members. The 122nd Infantry Divison reported in July that they shot about 30 female soldiers of the Red Army after they had refused them the right to surrender. The 167. Infantry Divison simply reported after taking a village in mid-August 1941 that \"a 14-year-old Flintenweib has been shot.\" The Army Command 16 reported for November 1941 that in the last 15 days \"80 partisans, 3 commissars and 3 women\" were shot.The last passage is especially pertinent because it shows that female soldiers of the Red Army belonged in a similar category for the Germans as political commissars of the Red Army. While no overarching order for all troops of the Wehrmacht ordering the murder of female soldiers existed like it did with the commissars (rather they existed on the army or divisional level as shown above), like the commissars, they were on the whole denied treatment as POWs or legitimate combatants. When not described as Flintenweiber, they are simply called \"women in uniform\" within the official documentation. When taken into captivity by unit that was under a standing kill order for women, they were initially processed together with the male POWs and brought to the POW camps for Soviet soldiers. While this, especially in 1941 and the initial months of 1942 was also virtually a death sentence as the Wehrmacht let Soviet prisoners starve to death as a matter of established policy during that time (about half of the initially captured 3 million Soviet POWs in 1941 and early 1942 starved to death, while of the total 6 million Soviet POWs, 3 million did not survive the war), it became established policy that after some time in these initial processing camps, female soldiers would be handed over to the Reich Security Main Office to be imprisoned in Concentration Camps.No Stalags or Offlags (POW camps for soldiers/NCOs and officers respectively) for women existed in the Wehrmacht structure of administering Soviet POWs. Rather, female Soviet soldiers were sent either to the Ravensbr\u00fcck Concentration Camp \u2013 the CC established initially specifically as a women's concentration camp \u2013 or to Auschwitz-Birkenau, the other camp that had a significant and separate women's camp within its structure. The Auschwitz camp gave out numbers for 90.000 women \u2013 meaning those that survived arrival and were registered at the camp \u2013 and after Jewish women, Poles and Soviets constituted the highest numbers of prisoners, although it is impossible to find out how many of the Soviet women had been members of the Red Army as that is not listed within the entry books. In Ravensbr\u00fcck about 18.000 female Soviet prisoners are known to have been incarcerated there, a considerable part of them most likely former Red Army members. These numbers also go to establish how few of them survived initial contact with the members of the German Wehrmacht. The exact number of female soldiers taken into German captivity as well as the number of women shot immediately after capture is unknown but is regularly estimated in the high ten thousands if not low hundred thousands. Furthermore, from the German files we can reconstruct that female soldiers of the Red Army tended to fight until death or commit suicide in order to escape capture by the Germans, no doubt because they knew what awaited them was death and/or rape and sexual assault, the extent of which is also not known but is estimated to have been almost ubiquitous.

A pretty good source, Ralph Mayer's *Artists Handbook (* 3rd edition, 1970) states that it was discontinued in the 19th c.,  as artists became aware of the origin.The idea behind the pigment was rather logical, actually.  Asphaltum ( AKA tar, derived from petroleum)  produces a very nice yellow-brown tint for oil paints. But because the tar itself doesn't actually solidify and stays plastic, if used in large amounts it will make the paint unstable, liable to cracking and peeling.  Very old asphaltum  was likely thought more stable,  dryer than the stuff recently dug out of the ground. As mummies were very old,  asphaltum from them ought to be best. Mayer may be correct that artists became creeped out by the stuff, but with the advance in knowledge of geology, in the 19th c. it would also have become obvious that a few thousand years sitting in a mummy would make little difference to petroleum that already had had 65-140 million years in formation. The other component, bone ash, could be found anywhere.  Likely  combination of tar and bone ash is what was being sold as mummy, in the 1960's.As to how much paint could be derived from a mummy: maybe the Windsor and Newton Company ( founded 1838) has some actual records of cost of mummy materials in their account books. But the Egyptians mummified animals as well as humans, and one suspects that a dozen cats were probably cheaper and so  more cost effective for paint production than one Nubian princess.By the way, tar + linseed oil, tar + varnish combinations are still known, some claim it's the best way to get a golden finish on oak furniture.EDIT : It also occurs to me that something called \"Mummy\" in the 1960's could simply have been something that duplicated  the tint. Just as real Vermillon ( a mercury compound) has mostly been replaced by newer, less toxic pigments, someone could have formulated something with, say, burnt umber and chrome yellow to get Mummy.EDIT 2  Doing a little more digging, it would seem that, although  mummy merchants, apothecaries, paint-makers and artists all thought that what they were dealing with was mostly asphaltum,  the mummies themselves, especially earlier ones,  could [contain a significant amount of abietic acid, AKA pine rosin](_URL_0_).  Rosin could have been as de-stabilizing to the paint as asphaltum, but it may have oxidized over time or reacted with the bone ash to become inert.

But having read the plot, and seeing that it implies that Salameh (the \"Red Prince\") was being protected and financed by the CIA in a *quid pro quo* arrangement, I can speak to that.Salameh, who was part of \"Black September\", otherwise known as a front group for Fatah, was also the commander of Force 17, charged with protecting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The Israelis saw Salameh's involvement in Munich as proof that Arafat himself was involved in the Munich Massacre, and obviously sought to take out Salameh. Salameh was not a very subtle guy, of course; he loved to live the high life, and famously went to Disneyland and Hawaii in 1977 on a trip reportedly arranged by the CIA itself. This came, of course, a few years after the botched attempt to kill Salameh, that resulted in the death of a waiter mistaken for Salameh, a situation that sparked a diplomatic crisis (the Lillehammer Affair) between Israel and Norway. The CIA had apparently even arranged to pay for the trip. Why? Well, as far as I've been able to tell, it was truly because, as contact man for secret talks between the PLO and the US, he had arranged a guarantee that American diplomats would not be attacked.This has leaked out over the years, but it's not clear when Israeli intelligence got hold of the information. At any rate, some contend that it wasn't until the Begin government came into power in 1977 that the hunt for Salameh was resumed, following the Lillehammer Affair. The affair's story is fascinating, and the horror of the agents when they discovered they had been mistaken despite tailing the man they thought was Salameh for hours with photos of him is gripping, but I'll spare you the details and move on to how Salameh was eventually found and killed. Unlike in *Munich*, three Israelis were *not* killed during the operation and aftermath, there was *not* (as far as I know) any encounter with CIA agents, and the individuals responsible were working with Mossad, whose director had been given a fairly free hand by the new Prime Minister to hunt down Salameh. The Red Prince had been spending all of his time in Beirut, with Arafat, where the PLO would stay until the Lebanese Civil War, and Israeli intervention into it, in 1982, when they were expelled by Israeli forces to Tunisia. Israel relied on a woman named Erika Chambers to get to him; she had joined the special operations department under Michael Harari in the Mossad, and prepared to become an assassin. She had already established a fake identity, and visited numerous Palestinian orphanages, seeking to meet PLO officials who also visited them. Indeed, she apparently even befriended Salameh himself during these visits, at which point she notified Mossad that she'd found him.Other agents had set up materials for explosives, and two other Israeli agents who infiltrated Lebanon using fake passports helped Chambers set up a vehicle with explosives along a route Salameh drove along daily to get to and from his home, that they had observed him repeatedly using. It was as simple as that: they loaded up a car with a bomb, waited for him to drive by, and detonated it, killing him instantly, along with four of his bodyguards and four bystanders. The agents then evacuated, went to the sea, got onto a naval commando boat, and came back to Mossad, where she received a hero's welcome. Only problem was, she left her British passport with the name \"Erika Chambers\" (her real name) in her Beirut apartment. Eventually, she retired and went entirely off the map, changing her name and cutting all ties with her family (besides occasional mail from undisclosed locations). As far as I know, she was never really heard from again, and she gave up her entire life to remain hidden and un-noteworthy after that. The Red Prince's death was celebrated in Israel, and went unmentioned by the CIA.So while it is true that Salameh was receiving some money, perks, etc. from the CIA, it's not clear to me that they were actually *protecting* him in any way, or that they intervened in an assassination attempt.It's worth noting that a decent chunk of *Munich* showed up the way it did based on the account of Juval Aviv, someone who claimed to be involved in the assassinations and who never was, and who the former Mossad director has said was an imposter. It was the release of *Munich* that prompted Zamir, head of Mossad until 1974, to say that the movie, \"is a kind of Western, but with no connection to reality\". He also pointed out that the Israeli motivation was not \"revenge\", so much as a dissatisfaction with the way Europe had handled the Munich Massacre. Until then, Israel had assumed \"that European nations would not allow Palestinian terror to operate on their soil\", which was why Israel never went after anyone in Europe before Munich. Israel saw itself as having to mete out justice, because terrorism against Israelis launched from Europe was growing, and European governments, Zamir said, seemed to do nothing but \"arrest them, [and] after a while they were released\".

There are a lot of points either way as to why Alexander was so successful. The Achaemenid Empire at the time of Alexander was not the same seemingly implacable kingdom that it had once been. It was wracked by internal division: Egypt is able to break away from 404-343BC, the Revolt of the Satraps occurred from 372-362BC, and in 401BC Cyrus the Younger made a failed bid to overthrow his brother Artaxerxes II. During the latter conflict a force of Greek mercenaries famously known as \"The Ten Thousand\" fought for Cyrus, and following his death made a fighting withdrawal from just north of Babylon all the way to the Black Sea and then to Greece. The fact an army was able to escape Persia in such a manner was a major sign that Persia was weak and was ripe for conquest.  Alexander's father, Philip II, had built Macedon's military from the ground up. He'd changed the way they fought - professionalising his soldiers, having them adopt the *sarissa* over the shorter and more traditional *dory* spear. In addition, Philip made his phalanxes twice as deep as was typically done. As a result, Macedonian phalangites were the most formidable in Greece. With this force Philip was able to subjugate all of Greece (bar Sparta) into his League of Corinth. Having done this, Philip readied his army for an invasion of the weakened Persia, before being assassinated in 336 BC, leaving the invasion ready to proceed under Alexander's command.So in these ways, Alexander did have his work made easier for him. However, when he did invade the Achaemenid Empire, Alexander achieved miraculous victory after miraculous victory - at Granicus, at Issus, at Gaugamela. Even with his excellent army and his experienced staff, one cannot say that he was not at least a competent general. In the immediate centuries after his death he was considered a brilliant general. Although it is likely an apocryphal story, the meeting of Hannibal and Scipio relayed by Appian has both the great generals agree without argument that Alexander was the finest general in history. This shows us what the view of Alexander as a general by writers near to the time was - that he was extraordinary. So yes, in many ways he did have a lot of factors in his favour - his great army, his experienced generals, the fact that he fought a Persia relatively weaker than it once had been. But even with all these, I would say it's unfair to then discount Alexander's own talent entirely: I think it's fair to say that he was one of the greatest generals of antiquity.

It's real in the sense that it causes real suffering in those who have it - people who commit suicide because of severe depression are not pretending. But a mental illness also a product of a time and a place and a culture: a mind is, practically, all about the relationship between a person and a world, and an illness of the mind is in some way a disordering of that relationship. If that world changes - and obviously it does, or history would be quite boring indeed - mental illnesses are also quite likely to change. The upshot of this is that it's unclear whether mental illnesses described by people in the past are the same as the ones today. The modern American psychiatric diagnostic manual - which has been incredibly influential on how English speakers conceptualise mental illness in 2016 - has only existed in its current form since the release of the DSM-III in 1980. In contrast, the way that Sigmund Freud categorises mental illness in books like *Introductory Lectures On Psychoanalysis* is very different; Freud categorises the illnesses by his perception of their psychological root causes (e.g., by the childhood problems he feels caused the disorders) rather than by groupings of symptoms that often happen together (as the DSM-III does). It's therefore often difficult to accurately compare mental illnesses from even 50-60 years ago to today, as psychiatrists and psychologists 50-60 years ago were often looking for very different things when they were making diagnoses (Freud was very influential in American psychiatry in the first two-thirds of the 20th century, though his influence declined rapidly after the 1970s). Reading Freud's case studies, he goes into quite a lot of detail about his patients, but it's not always easy to diagnose his patients according to the current DSM-V, because Freud is often focused on very different stuff to what a modern psychiatrist or clinical psychologist would look for.The most vivid example of this issue is the (mostly female) mental illness that was called 'hysteria'. Freud wrote extensively about hysteria in works like *Introductory Lectures On Psychoanalysis*; reading his writing on hysteria in 2016 is interesting, because the peculiar set of symptoms that seemed to characterise hysteria (the physicalisation of psychological distress, a certain sense of over-emotionality that is still seen in the layman's meaning of the word, etc) are way less common than they seem to have been in Freud's day. In a book that it should be noted is titled *Introductory Lectures On Psychoanalysis* Freud actually doesn't bother to explain in much detail what hysteria is, and in fact clearly states that he doesn't need to - everybody already knows. Nonetheless, hysteria is not a commonly discussed mental disorder in 2016 (when's the last time there were frenzied media stories about people with 'conversion disorder', which is what psychiatrists now call it?) and seems to be much less frequent than it was. If societal conditions in Freud's day played a role in the way that its disorder manifested, it seems likely that things like women's rights and a more sexually open society changed those conditions in a way that reduced its frequency.Which is to say that it's difficult to say whether depression is more prominent today than it was in 1366 AD, because we likely have a somewhat different conception of it today than they had in 1366 AD. Even if the symptoms were similar, it might not even be quite the same mental illness in a very real sense, because of the fairly large changes in Western society in the intervening hundreds of years (a mental illness that occurs because of brain state A and social situation X may have very similar symptoms to a mental illness that requires brain state B and social situation Y, but would clearly have different causes despite the similar symptoms).With all that said: yes, many historical writers have written extensively about mental illness. In terms of thousands of years ago, the modern English word 'melancholy' comes from a Greek term 'melancholia', a word that originally meant 'black bile'. Ancient Greek writers appeared to believe that there was a causal relationship between levels of 'black bile' in your system and mental illness. It's not tremendously clear what the ancient Greek physicians meant exactly by 'melancholia' - [Stanley W. Jackson](_URL_0_) argued that the term not only included symptoms that sound to us like depression but also symptoms that come across as being indicative of schizophrenia. Whatever it meant, the term was discussed in writings attributed to Hippocrates, Aristotle, and Galen.In terms of hundreds of years ago, the English writer Robert Burton's *The Anatomy Of Melancholy*, first published in 1621 in Latin, discusses a condition that is clearly closer in definition to clinical depression than the Ancient Greek melancholia. There's [an old translation available freely on the web](_URL_1_), and [a more modern 2001 translation from the Latin currently in stock at Amazon](_URL_2_). As you might guess from there being recent translations, it's a fairly well known literary work; it's a forbiddingly lengthy book that discourses on the nature and philosophy of the mental condition - going into theology and demonology as well as theories about black bile - and quotes previous authors at length.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The first recorded case of a person suffering from depression was in the year 900 BC.

This is so because games are entangled in philosophy: because you have rules and goals that guide player actions, players end up making value judgments about what things are \"good\" strategies in the context of the game, vs. which things don't matter at all.For example, because Simcity models crime, the designers of Simcity also have to make a statement about _why_ crime occurs, what influences it, what its costs on the city are, etc. And if you were the designer of Simcity, you might incorporate different assumptions about crime and what its factors are, even after reading a lot of material on the subject. You might even decide to model crime as being beneficial in certain ways. And this decision doesn't occur in objective isolation - if crime affects more things, then it weighs itself more on the player's mind. Or you could eliminate crime altogether and bury it in a different model of happiness or civil order.Likewise, in sports games like Madden NFL where a roster of sports stars is presented to the player, the designers have to interpret each player and assign them stats. The stats are all funny numbers and can't possibly portray how a human being actually functions in playing sports, but we take them as \"believable\" based on our collective understanding of what that person is capable of.Because of this, when a game includes a huge quantity of variables and source material in its simulation, as in Paradox sims like Crusader Kings, that doesn't tell us anything about its accuracy. It makes the portrayal more detailed, but it's still based on assumptions about what's important and worth conveying to the player, and what gets blotted out into a simple assumption or a token representation, if not entirely erased. We can point to simple factual errors like transposing people or technology to the wrong time and place, but those aren't really the interesting part of discussing how games interpret history.With many games of this type(Paradox sims among them) the biases lean towards a Great Man interpretation, where leaders and their political and military dealings take precedence over other aspects of society. Besides being a familiar trope from the era of pre-computerized wargaming, this convention provides a plausible entry point for the game mechanic - you get to control the leadership in some god-like fashion, usually heavily inaccurate to how an actual leader would have to do their duties - and the goals of the leader generally align with the goals of the player, in terms of gaining more power and defeating enemies. It all works out to a neat scorecard at the end of the game measuring just how badass you were, based on the assumption that being a badass is important and the only thing that matters.One way in which Crusader Kings differs a little from the convention is in how the player sits a little bit outside the structure of being a single leader, but rather is managing an entire dynasty. In this aspect the game's viewpoint is particularly focused on internal power struggles of the medieval era, but it's not going to give you the depth that you would have if it were a game about a single leader at a particular time.

That is, to supply troops when called upon, to make sure there were useable bridges on one's land, and to maintain fortifications and defenses.The bridge obligation has a backstory rather different than the other two mentioned there (in short, it first appears much later in sources and even then only sporadically, and there was a shift in concern over time from the *building* of bridges to their *maintenance*). What's important is that, until the middle of the eleventh century, it was a universal requirement.But then it became a bargaining chip.An early eleventh-century charter transferring land from the king to the queen explicitly grants the holder of the land the right not to maintain bridges, fortification, or to levy an army. Now, this is pretty clearly a very special case given the people involved (and in fact, Aethelred also frees the land from royal taxes), but it introduces the idea that general, univeral obligations are in fact something within the king's power to levy and remit.The Normans and Angevins cultivate this innovation into a bargaining chip.After the Conquest, with the foundation of new monasteries (i.e. major landowners) and the need for older ones to reassert their legal privileges, houses received and recorded charters as the legal document guaranteeing their existence and privileges. A *lot* of these charters include the freedom from building/repairing bridges - a lot of them also happen to be forgeries, or have that particular clause added. What is noteworthy for present purposes is the maturing of a belief that the king has power over the requirement of bridge construction.When Henry I came to the throne, it was not under the most promising of military circumstances. Henry's brother Robert was challenging him for the throne and possibly looking to mount an armed invasion. Henry was a new king with no track record in an age that valued personal relationships. So how did he secure his throne? He bought the barons' loyalty - and their firepower.The so-called Coronation Charter includes the following passage: >  \u2018To knights who hold their lands by military service, I concede by myown gift that the lands of their demesne ploughs **be quit of all gelds and from all work**, so that thus relieved from such a great hardship, they provide themselves well with horses and arms, so that they are equipped and prepared to serve me and to defend my realm. *(trans. Cooper*)In other words, Henry issued a blanket immunity in exchange for soldiers (and perhaps more to the point, as a way to say \"Hey, Robert would make you keep it up. Aren't I better?\")Medieval law worked on cases and specifics, not generalities. So after the Coronation Charter, the requirement to build and keep up bridges was used as carrot and stick in the power balance between a king and a given lord, depending on very concrete circumstances of a specific time. The general public obligation had essentially been privatized, turned into just another tool under the power of the king.

The Individual Italian soldier was for the most part brave and willing to fight, but they were ineptly led,  poorly supplied, and inadequately armed. Fascist Italy never had the full support of the people when they went to war, what little Jingoism they had quickly dissipated when the British appeared of the coast of Italy and destroyed two Italian battleships. Mussolini had envisioned a \"separate war\" from Germany, but that quickly became impossible as Italy went from defeat to defeat. Mussolini, in order to enlarge the size of his army, instituted \"Binary\" infantry divisions. This means that each division only had two brigades of infantry as opposed to the three or four of other nations. So right of the bat the average Italian infantry division is going to be weaker than its counterparts. This came into play in Greece and France when stronger Greek and French infantry divisions were able to easily repel more numerous Italian infantry divisions. Italy while it had a comparatively modern air force and somewhat modern navy, had almost completely neglected armoured development. Mussolini was deeply distrustful of foreign companies and gave Italian companies like FIAT a monoply on vehicle production. This meant that the tanks Italy did produce were often inefficient and inferior to the tanks fielded by Germany, the USA, and Britain. Even the elite Italian armoured divisions like the 132nd Armoured division (nicknamed Ariete) couldn't stand up to the tank divisions of Britain. In North Africa Rommel did not trust the Italian armoured divisions for exactly this reason. While the division did fight admirably at points, its lack of decent tanks caught up to it and it was eventually destroyed at the Battle of El Alamein. Italy also had issues with mechanized transport. They had next to no mechanization. When Italy invaded British Egypt, they did so in long fighting columns that really belonged more to the 19th century than to the 20th. This lack of motorized transport would come to haunt them in Operation Compass. When a British motorized unit outflanked the retreating Italians and cut them off, taking over 100,000 prisoners. This lack of motorized transport also meant that the Italians could partake in the rapid offensive movements that their German allies did. This led to them being relegated to cannon fodder since they could not be used to achieve breakthroughs, like the German Panzer and Motorized units could.The Italian commanders were also often hamstrung by Mussolini who demanded they launch costly offensives that had little chance of success. Like in France and Greece when Mussolini demanded that his generals launch offensives into heavily defended, mountainous terrain. The Italian commander in Libya, Rodolfo Graziani, did not want to invade Egypt because he knew his army was not ready, but Mussolini forced him to.  Finally, the Italian Army was just not ready for war. Mussolini had been told that his army wouldn't be ready until at least 1943, but when the French began to collapse rapidly and Britain looked poised to do the same, he declared war expecting a short war. The Italians had no motorized divisions to speak of, the rest of their army was being modernized , and they just did not, as a country, have the ability to sustain a modern European war.Sources:Hitler's Italian Allies by Macgegor KnoxThe Fall of Mussolini by Phillip MorganMussolini by Dennis Mack Smith", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Italian Army was a rag-tag collection of poorly trained, poorly equipped, and poorly armed soldiers.

Now if you want to know \"how much\" of the issues that African countries currently face are due to colonializm, that is going to be hard to quantify. You have to remember Africa is huge, 30 million square miles and over a billion people. It has (now) 54 different countries. Many more tribal groups and languages. Clearly European influence has drastically impacted all the countries in Africa, but it is impossible to say that is responsible for all instability on the continent. It had different effects in different places. So while you can say that European influence led to Africa being the way it is, that isn't the only factor. The current state is also because of war, famine, tribal and religious tensions, the Cold War, military coups, and global ecconomic conditions. All of which had different effects in different places at different times. In short there is no ways to say something like \"78% of instability in Africa is due to colonialism.\" I hope I am not discouraging you in any way.

Fasting, it is worth emphasizing does *not* include a total reduction in the overall number of calories consumed. It's actually a bit of a joke among practicing Muslims that the iftars and suhoors can be so lavish that many actually *gain* weight during Ramadan.Because the Islamic calendar is lunar, the timing of Ramadan shifts against the solar calendar about ten days earlier each year. The timing of Ramadan is itself variable because it depends upon the sighting of the moon. There are substantial disputes between the four primary Sunni legal schools over the timing and calculation of the start of Ramadan, and between the Sunnis and other Islamic sects. These differences are arcane, legalistic, and complicated; the Encyclopaedia of Islam entry on them suggests as further reading a dozen books in five languages. Anyways, this is a bit of a digression.The shortest answer to your question is that while fasting is obligatory for all Muslims, there are categories of people exempted from the fast. These include (among others) 1. travelers, 2. soldiers on campaigns. At least in the Shafii school, those engaged in heavy physical labor should start the fast, but are permitted to break it if they must.The exemption for soldiers is made clear in the hadith, the collected sayings of the prophet, and more generally of the example set by his companions. [For example:](_URL_0_) >  Abu Sa'id al-Khudri (Allah be pleased with him) reported: >  We went out on an expedition with the Messenger of Allah (\ufdfa) during Ramadan and neither the observer of the fast was found fault with for his fasting, nor the breaker of the fast for breaking it.**Edit**: The word \"expedition\" in the Arabic is an explicitly military expedition, \"ghazw\", originally in etymology a raid, but by extension the holy raids led by Muhammad and holy conquests and expeditions more generally. The Arabic word for \"Holy Warrior\" being \"Ghazi\" which can also be an honorific title. Anyways, I digress. **[End of edit]**I'm not familiar enough with the source history of the Ottoman armies to know whether any individual soldiers or officers held their fast during Ramadan, but as I have described they were not obligated to do so.It's impossible to prove a negative, I can't say definitively that fasting or non-fasting had *no* effect on Ottoman armies, but I will point to two things:One, if there was an effect, it was of so little importance that the word \"Ramadan\" appears only once in the first three volumes (a couple thousand pages) of the Cambridge History of Turkey.Two, the modern understanding of hydration on combat effectiveness wasn't understood until the 20th century. My understanding is that most of the pioneering studies on this were conducted by the Israelis, who for somewhat obvious reasons have always been on the lookout for a competitive edge in desert combat.The point being that even if binging food and water in the pre-dawn and after-sundown hours isn't precisely the best thing for combat effectiveness, it's not as though non-Muslim opponents of the Ottomans would have any better an idea of the importance of hydration and food.That's of course leaving aside that what constituted \"effectiveness\" in pre- and early-modern combat would have looked wildly different to commanders of that era than they do to us today. This isn't exactly my area of specialty, but just look at how important many such commanders and soliders throughout history thought it was [vitally important to be drunk during battle.](_URL_1_) Whatever strictures Islam places on the consumption of alcohol, the Ottoman troops [might well have enjoyed this \"advantage\"](_URL_2_) as well.Sourcewise:Aside from the ones referenced, see the *Encyclopaedia of Islam* entry on \"Sawm\" (fasting).edit (ninja?): typoEdit (definitely not ninja): More typos.

First, I don't think that Norse people during the Viking Age would have considered seidr to be magic, any more than we consider science to be magic. It was a way of thinking about the world, and it was just as rational or irrational as any other.  In particular, it was probably a way of thinking about how human beings were related to each other, to animals, and to the natural world. The Norse don't seem to have though of themselves as belonging to a species inviolably separate from any others. Instead, people had the ability to shift species, to take on the attributes of other species, and later Norse legends record beliefs that the natural world was actually made of once-living beings, such as giants, humans, and serpents.This brings me to my second point. If we're right in assuming that seidr was a shamanistic way of thinking about the world that allowed people to shift between categories, then we shouldn't assume that it belonged to a particular gender. In fact, people that perform shaman rituals that are supposed to transgress boundaries between species, etc., often transgress gender boundaries as well. So sometimes we find women buried like men, such as with spears, or men buried like women, such as with bead necklaces.Onto my third point. Many people still performed normative gender roles during the Viking Age, and the seidr way of thinking also seems to have impacted the way they performed these male/female roles. For example, women often would brew beer or mead, which could been seen as transforming one thing into another thing, and which certainly had mythical implications, so this could be an example of seidr. Or men going into battle would often wear little icons of boars or invoke bear spirits, which could also be considered a seidr practice. So seidr was really something that could apply to both genders.That said, your impression that seidr is mostly feminine is a common impression. In part, this is because archaeological finds have turned up some very strange women's graves, which make it look like women often would perform special ritual roles in Norse cultures. But it's also because modern people\u2014that is, people used to living among religions like Christianity, Islam, or Judaism, which are often dominated by male hierarchies\u2014are very interested in asking questions about religions that might have been more feminine or more democratic.So, in sum, seidr was probably actually about transgressing boundaries, which could include gender crossing, but because it was a larger way of thinking, it could also accommodate the performance of normative gender roles. Neil Price is especially emphatic that male violence was the ugly underside of seidr. Our focus on seidr as a women's domain is more about our own cultural preoccupations than with the lived experience of the peoples of the Viking Age.* Neil S.

The Thirteenth Amendment was a bit of a group effort, largely involving the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senator John B. Henderson submitted a joint resolution to have the committee consider a constitutional amendment for abolition, kicking things off. Representatives James Mitchell Ashley and James F. Wilson offered some of the earlier versions. Other versions that were more expansive were proposed by Representative Thaddeus Stevens and Senator Charles Sumner. Sumner proposed the following language on February 8, 1864: > All persons are equal before the law, so that no person can hold another as a slave; and the Congress shall have power to make all laws necessary and proper to carry this declaration into effect everywhere in the United States.The Senate Judiciary Committee was chaired by Senator Lyman Trumbull, who wanted less expansive language and to compromise between the Radical Republicans (more liberal) and more conservative Republicans such as Lincoln who were compromise-driven. Wilson, Ashley, Henderson's proposals were incorporated into the Judiciary Committee's proposal to the Senate, which also included text from the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which created the Northwest Territories and prohibited slavery therein. This 1787 Ordinance, specifically Article 6, is where you first see the language you refer to: > Art. 6.\u00a0There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory, **otherwise than in the punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted**: Provided, always, That any person escaping into the same, from whom labor or service is lawfully claimed in any one of the original States, such fugitive may be lawfully reclaimed and conveyed to the person claiming his or her labor or service as aforesaid.Given that the Fugitive Slave Clause was to be no more, the latter bit about fugitive slaves was obviously not included. It basically incorporated everything up to the colon.Henderson's version included language changing the amendment procedure, allowing for a simple majority in both houses as well as ratification by 2/3 of the states, which was removed by the committee. The amendment would go through a year of opposition by Southern Democrats until the Republicans gained a mandate in both houses in 1864, making the pathway to passage easier. By January 1865, Lincoln was making personal appeals to members of Congress to get passage. It passed on January 31, 1865. Lincoln signed the amendment on February 1, 1865, though this was not really required (as confirmed by a Congressional Resolution passed on February 7). It then took until December 6, 1865 to get the amendment ratified by the states (the worst stragglers were South Carolina, Alabama, North Carolina, and Georgia, though New Hampshire, Connecticut, Arkansas, and Tennessee took their time too).

It represents one of the first, most basic  abstractions we encounter. It naturally leads to the invention of useful concepts like negative numbers. It's vital in the analysis of... well... everything. Part of the reason for that is that 0 captures the notion of 'doing nothing' to something, the idea of 'identity'.As far as I've learned -- it was the Indian's who invented 0 around 975CE. * The year the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic was first proved.Primes are the most important class of number, period. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic is of vital importance in number theory. I won't go into massive detail, but suffice that Multiplicative, Integer Number Theory is basically all either consequences of this theorem, or theorems in service of the proof of this theorem. It's a sort of 'theory of everything' for multiplication. It was initially proved by Euclid in *The Elements*, but I would say that Gauss' proof in 1801CE is more rigorous and more useful, and I'd use that. * The Proof of Godel's Incompleteness TheoremGodel's Incompleteness Theorem represents a sea-change in how we think about mathematics. Up until that point, Mathematics had been questioning it's foundations, and desperately seeking a fundamental set of axioms which represented a foundation for all mathematics. These efforts culminated in Russel's Type Theory, a theory so wrapped up in formalism that it took three and a half pages for it to prove `2+2=4`. Godel proved that even this best hope for a foundation of mathematics would never be sufficient to prove every possible theorem. Godel's proof shows that in any sufficiently powerful axiomatic system, there are some true theorems which are unprovable. This simple, 20ish page proof changed our motivations in mathematics. It was no longer a rush to the bottom, but rather a rush to new fields, with foundational connections seen as a tool, rather than as a target, of mathematics.Godel proved these theorems in 1931CE.-----------------------------------------------Part of my reasoning for choosing those dates is that each section represents a shift in our mathematical maturity. From the Inception of Mathematics near the dawn of civilization, we treated the entirety of mathematics in a very mechanistic, mystical way -- each question was considered on it's own, with no connection between problems that we now regard as fundamentally the same. The essence was Arithmetic without Abstraction. It served for a while, but the invention of 0 can really be seen as the invention of the first purely abstract mathematical concept. There is no 'nothing' which is concrete to hold on to. There is only the idea of nothing. We might call the time leading up to the invention of zero the 'Mathematics as Concretion' era, and the time after as 'Mathematics as Abstraction' phase.The next change is a distinction of rigor, before Gauss and the FToA, Mathematics was a discovery-oriented 'intuition'-based system. The notion of proof was there, but it was by no means designed for rigor. FToA marks the turning point where rigor becomes the name of the mathematical game, and this in turn increases the ability to be abstract -- because it doesn't matter how little intuition you can bring to bear -- it's only the logical artifacts that 'matter' in the sense of mathematics. Technically, this change started before the previous era distinction, so it's somewhat inappropriate to combine the two divisions, but if I can take the license, I'd say that this distinguishes itself from the \"Age of Mathematical Abstraction\" and becomes the \"Age of Mathematical Rigor\".Finally, Godel. Godel's proof represents the synthesis of the previous two ages. After 0 and before FToA, Mathematics was about intuition, exploration, and acquisition of new ideas and techniques. After FToA, mathematics got a bit gunshy on the exploration front. We ran back to cover ourselves from our now obvious lack of rigor. We re-built Euclidean Geometry, uncovering deficits of reason which built new subfields, but curiously in the 150 years between FToA and Incompleteness, only a handful of _brand new_ fields were really created. Most of the new systems were specifications and rigorizations of existing ideas. Algebra became a suite of systems which dealt with axiomatic structure of equations. Analysis and Number Theory became axiomatic explorations of continuity and convergence. Topology is probably the closest thing to 'new' in this period, and it is really a sort of amalgam of Algebra and Geometry and Analysis. Ultimately this 'rigor panic' lead to the idea that all mathematics must flow from one fundamental source of axioms. These were the building blocks, and if we could see them, we could somehow finally have some modicum of peace and get back to the exploring -- a hopeless dream, we knew we'd never be satisfied with any one set of axioms, no matter how obvious. Godel shot this idea out of the water. He proved, conclusively, that no finite set of axioms could ever support the weight of an infinite mathematics. He, in one stroke, told everyone what they least wanted to hear, and most needed to know -- mathematics is not perfectly rigorous, there will always need to be new blocks added to the foundation, and it was okay -- that was how mathematics had to work. His work not only saved us from a futile and endless rush to the bottom of mathematics, but also (essentially) founded the first truly new field since before FToA and the onset of the Rigorous Age. He invented Metamathematics -- a rigorous exploration of abstract mathematical systems. With this he ushered in what we might call the \"Age of Mathematical Exploration\" -- dozens of new fields popped up, and helped solve age old problems. We live in this age now, Mathematics is about exploring new things and using those old foundational tools (things like Set Theory and ~~Category Theory~~ Universal Algebra and Type Theory[1] and so on) to help translate ideas between fields, but we no longer regard those tools as the 'point' of mathematics. Godel's proof taught us that the point of mathematics was simply to explore new abstractions, ideas, and ways of thought. That's why -- if nothing else, I think his change deserves a marker in time, it's when Mathematics grew up, and arguably -- we've done more mathematics in the last 80 some-odd years then in the thousand before it.Mark my words, after the prime number signals come from the aliens, the first question they'll ask is \"Have you found a foundation for all mathematics yet?\" -- We'll say \"No, we found there can't be one\" and they'll look at us and say, \"Good, we didn't land to early then.

This largely depends on what you mean by \"voluntary.\" (edit: added subheadings for easier reading. 2nd edit: added a bit more on the Classic Period)**Sacrifice and Warfare**With a few specific exceptions, most sacrifices were captive enemy soldiers who were taken in battle. Among many Mesoamerican cultures, capturing an enemy in battle for sacrifice was a kind of \"rite of passage\" for warriors. Maya nobility, for example, would take the name of their first captive as an epithet. (e.g., So-and-so, Sacred King of City, Captor of Whats-his-face.) Capturing an enemy nobleman was of prime importance, as this altered the political relationship between the two cities, and noble blood was considered more potent. In Aztec culture, taking captives was a way for commoners to advance in society. Taking a captive in battle made you an adult, and if you could capture enough enemy soldiers for sacrifice you could be recruited into one of the prestigious military orders, and possibly even earn you a noble title.So within warfare, there was a strong incentive to take captives. While it was quite common to simply *kill* opponents on the battlefield, an ambitious soldier would try to incapacitate his opponent and take him back to his home city to be killed later. However, not *all* sacrifices were prisoners of war; some were slaves or even commoners. (And in one particularly gruesome ritual, children.) The exact criteria for which sacrifices were chosen varied depending on:* a.) The culture in question* b.) The god being honored* c.) The specific sacrificial ritualIn the case of prisoners of war, I don't think you could really call that *voluntary*, in the sense that nobody wants to get captured and sacrificed. But in a sense, it was, as the captive soldier was presumably trying to do the same thing to his opponent. When a soldier gets called to war and marches out to battle he knows that he might die. That's simply part of war. The only difference in this case is that the actual *dying* part is postponed for a while. In other cases, when sacrifices were chosen from other segments of the population (i.e., slaves), I think it would be difficult to call it a voluntary arrangement. (Slaves were typically purchased for this occasion.)**Honor in Sacrifice**As for your second question, I would say the answer is 'yes,' sacrifice was considered honorable, but the specifics vary from culture to culture. In general, Mesoamerican people saw their relationship with the gods as a reciprocal one that involved the exchange of vital energies. The gods expended energy by bringing rains, providing sunlight, or fertile soil for crops. Humans consumed this energy by eating, breathing, etc. Many Mesoamerican creation myths describe deities sacrificing themselves to create/sustain the mortal world. Because of this, humans were *indebted* to the gods, and had to return energy to them. There were a number of ways this could be done, such as burning incense, sacrificing animals, or spilling some of your own blood. But the ultimate way humans returned energy to the gods was by dying. When a human died, their energy returned to the earth. In a sense, we eat from the earth and the earth eats us. Among the Aztecs, people selected for sacrifice were ritually cleansed and adorned in garments and insignia of the deity for whom they were to be sacrificed. In this process, the sacrificial victim became an *ixiptla* - a deity impersonator. From their perspective, the sacrificial victim *became* the earthly incarnation of that deity as long as he fulfilled that role. After the ritual was complete, the skull of the victim was often removed and placed in a skull rack near the temple. The femurs (thighs) of the victim were taken to the home of the sponsor of the sacrifice (typically the person who captured him) where they were hung on the wall during a feast that honored the victim. The flesh of the thighbones was usually eaten by the captor at this feast. (Cannibalism tends to freak people out, but they didn't see this as insulting - quite the contrary it was a means by which the captor could partake of the sacrifice's 'gift.')**Sacrifice in different cultures**We have less historical sources on sacrifice outside of the Aztecs, but archaeological and iconographic evidence paints a similar picture. Burials of human sacrifices among many Mesoamerican cultures are found with disarticulated skulls and femurs, which suggests that the Aztec practice of removing these parts of the body has a long tradition in Mesoamerica. Other forms of sacrifice appear to have been more popular in the Classsic Period, but fell out of popularity by the time of the Aztecs. Ritual decapitation is a good example of this - it appears among the Maya and at Teotihuacan, but was not that common in the Postclassic. Maya sacrifices appear to have occurred following a post battle parade that might be considered roughly analogous to a Roman 'triumph.' The hieroglyphic inscriptions describe a ritual known (to epigraphers) as *Na* (Schele 1984) that victims underwent prior to sacrifice. It's unclear what this is, exactly, but it might involve torture and/or bloodletting. There are some weird impact notches on the outer surface of the ribs of some sacrificial victims that may have been formed during this ritual. Like with the Aztecs, Maya sacrificial victims were 'honored,' but the main point is to elevate the prestige of the person capturing him. When sacrificial victims are depicted in stelae, they are shown bound, kneeling, and sometimes naked. Their 'submissive' depiction is set in strong contrast to depictions of their captors, who are standing, armed, and decorated in elaborate regalia. This artistic representation of captives is also echoed among the Zapotec culture of southern Mexico, where images of sacrificial victims were carved into stone slabs known today as *danzantes*. These carvings depict victims in a post-mortem grimace, often with graphic (though highly stylized) depictions of blood and organs. They are also naked, and some of the earliest *danzantes* are found face-up at temple entrances so you would literally have to walk over them to enter the temple. Combined, this seems to show that the purpose of such carvings was to reinforce the dominance of the victorious group, and the submissive nature of those who were defeated.Among the Tarascans, human sacrifice appears to largely follow the Aztec model. Disarticulated skulls and femurs found in archaeological contexts indicate that the ritual practices were similar to those of the Aztecs. The historical records *appear* to indicate (we don't know for sure) that early in the empire's history the Tarascans engaged in ritual warfare for the purposes of collecting sacrifices (similar to the Aztec 'flower wars'), although this seems to have largely ceased by the time the Spanish arrived. The largest difference between the Tarascans and the Aztecs on this practice is that the Tarascans appear to have used sacrifice as a punitive measure as well. Towns/cities that did not resist were spared, but if a city put up a particularly truculent defense the Tarascans would often sacrifice people in mass. The historical records (and again, not sure how much we can trust these here) indicate that when a hostile town/city fell, the wounded, infants, and elderly were sacrificed on the spot, and the remaining soldiers were taken back to the capital to be sacrificed later. This appears to have been a form of collective punishment aimed to encourage other towns to surrender without fighting.EDIT: Holy crap! I've never gotten reddit gold before!

The first would pit Chile against Argentina, while the second would add Brazil to the mix. The main driver of tension between Chile and Argentina were several border disputes, as well as the ownership of the disputed Beagle Channel. There was little tension between either Chile or Argentina and Brazil, but the Brazilian naval build-up threatened to overturn the balance of power.The first naval race was sparked, in 1887, by the Chilean ordering of a new ironclad battleship, the *Capitan Prat*. This was accompanied by orders for two new cruisers, two torpedo boats, and weapons for the expansion of the Chilean Army. This seriously threatened Argentina - with the new ships, the Chilean navy would be more experienced and have bigger ships, enough to counteract Argentina's advantage in numbers. The Argentinian navy responded by ordering two more battleships, and two new cruisers. In 1891, Chile underwent a civil war, which failed to loosen tensions. The Chilean Navy had been a major supporter of the winning side, and so its star was in the ascendance. This led to an increase in spending, most of which went on buying new cruisers. The Argentinians responded in kind, driving tensions higher. In 1898, the Argentinians ordered two Italian armoured cruisers, to which Chile did not have an answer. This seemed to the Chileans like a prelude to war, so they moved towards arbitration of several results, calling in the British. However, the arbitration took time, and the naval race continued. The Chileans ordered two new fast battleships in 1901, to which the Argentinians responded for by publishing tenders for a new battleship. This drove tensions further, endangering British trade interests in both countries. The British stepped in, and insisted on a negotiated solution to the crisis. Talks were held in Santiago, Chile's capital, which led to the signing of the 'Pacts of May' in May 1902. These assigned territories and spheres of influence between the two countries, arbitrated by the British. More importantly for the naval side, they included an arms limitation pact. The two Chilean battleships were sold to the Royal Navy, becoming the *Swiftsure* class, while the two Argentinian cruisers became the Japanese *Kasuga* class. Several older ships were disarmed, and a five year moratorium placed on new warship acquisitions. This pact lasted until 1906, when Brazil placed orders for new battleships. This was the result of a 1904 decision by the Brazilian Congress to acquire new warships, as a way of spending higher revenue from increased coffee and rubber demand, and as a way to boost Brazil's standing in the world. Following a year of indecision as to how the new fleet should be composed, two new dreadnoughts were ordered from British yards (with a third to come once they were delivered). The order was seen as suspicious by some, as this order would result in Brazil getting dreadnoughts before more established naval powers like France and Russia - rumours quickly spread that Brazil was acting as an agent for some third party. This plan was a direct threat to Argentina, with its building constrained by the Pacts of May. The response decided upon was to cancel the treaty, and procure new ships. However, there was fierce internal dispute about this, as many saw the Brazilian plan as unaffordable, while the hardliners worried about a pre-emptive strike. There were even suggestions that Argentina should attack Brazil before the ships could be delivered, should Brazil refuse to cancel them (though the Argentine population did not support such decisive action). In August 1908, an Armaments Procurement Act was passed, which called for the spending of $55 million on new warships. This led to intense competition for the contracts, with no fewer than 144 tenders being submitted by firms from five countries. In 1910, orders were placed with the American Fore River Company for two new 30,000 tonne battleships. This was a first for American shipbuilding, which had traditionally lagged behind its European competitors. It was also a win for the State Department, which saw it as a way to encourage solidarity between nations in the Americas. The Chileans were late arrivers to the race. While the resumption of building in Argentina was a threat to Chile, the Chilean economy was not initially able to support new naval building. The nitrate market (one of Chile's main exports) had crashed in 1907, and then in 1908 an earthquake had devastated much of the country. However, a brief war scare with Peru helped push Chile towards buying new ships. Thanks to close ties to the RN, the Chilean Navy placed orders for two new battleships with the British company of Armstrong Whitworth. However, shortly after the Chilean orders, the naval race began to slow down. The two Brazilian battleships had been delivered in January and July 1910, but in November of that year, the Brazilian Navy experienced a severe mutiny. Nicknamed 'the Revolt of the Lash', sailors seized several ships, including the two battleships in protest against poor treatment and conditions, including excessive use of corporal punishment. To bring their point home, they bombarded Rio de Janeiro, while military action by loyalist ships was hamstrung by the Brazilian Admiralty's unwillingness to fire upon their most expensive and prestigious ships. Negotiations with the mutineers were ultimately successful, leading to the end of corporal punishment and an amnesty for all involved. The mutiny led to a lack of confidence in the navy, and many ships, including the two dreadnoughts, were effectively disarmed to prevent any re-occurrence. Additionally, Brazil's economic situation was beginning to turn, as British rubber plantations opened in the Far East and a European depression caused loans to dry up. While a third (excessively-armed) battleship had been ordered, she was sold to the Ottoman Empire in 1913. This reduced tensions, allowing Argentina and Chile, which had also been suffering monetary troubles, to consider selling their ships. There was considerable popular demand for the money so raised to be spent on internal improvements - welfare programs and nationalised services - rather than on the fleet, feelings echoed in Brazil. The Brazilians did place tenders with Armstrong Whitworth and Vickers for new battleship designs in 1914. However, the beginning of WWI would effectively draw a close on the South American dreadnought race. The two Chilean battleships building in the UK were requisitioned by the RN, with one becoming the battleship *Canada*, and the other being converted into the carrier *Eagle* (while the Brazilian battleship sold to the Ottomans became the British *Agincourt*). The shipbuilders of the belligerent nations closed their doors to foreign customers - and as none of the South American countries had sufficient industry to build such ships themselves, they were dependent on the foreign yards that were no longer available. The dreadnought race never brought the three countries close to war, unlike the earlier race between Argentina and Chile, mainly because of internal calls for domestic spending which were less prominent in the earlier race.

The policies agreed upon were; >  * To maintain an economic blockade of the Axis by sea, land, air, and by commodity control through diplomatic and financial means. >  * To conduct a sustained air offensive to destroy Axis military power. >  * To effect \"early elimination\" of Italy as an Axis partner. >  * To conduct raids and minor offensives. >  * To support neutrals and underground groups in resisting the Axis. >  * To build up the necessary forces for the eventual offensive against Germany. >  * To capture positions from which to launch that offensive.In writing their long-term strategy (\u201cVictory Plan\u201d) for the defeat of Germany and Japan in the World War, U.S. War Department planners led by Alfred C. Wedemeyer assumed several things in mid-1941, which turned out to not be reflected by the realities of the course of the war by 1943. As the Soviet Union was in a precarious position by the fall of 1941, a potential German victory was on the table. The Eastern Front was exceedingly brutal for both sides, and it was estimated that Germany would need at least a year after the victory over the Soviet Union to catch its breath, utilize the natural and economic resources of a defeated enemy, and prepare itself for an offensive against the other major Allied power in Europe, Great Britain. After Great Britain was driven out of North Africa and the Mediterranean, an invasion of the main islands (noted also, by implication at the time, to be impaired by a lack of *Kriegsmarine* ships or coherent strategy) would be undertaken or a negotiated peace would be sought. **If Britain was defeated, the United States would need to secure the Western Hemisphere until the earliest date at which they could conduct offensive operations against Germany**, rallying allies to their side all the while.U.S. planners were not optimistic about Great Britain\u2019s situation in 1941; >  G-2 analyses could not confidently predict victory of the United Kingdom, even with full American collaboration. British reverses in the Middle East, or a Russian collapse on that front, would enable the Germans to concentrate an overwhelming military force against England. For the British, the situation hinged on three issues: the German ability to win quickly in Russia without suffering excessive losses; the German ability to reconstitute military forces quickly after that victory; and the German ability to control...and exploit their resources with the use of minimal forces. Having outlined such grim prospects, Smith concluded that \"from a long range viewpoint, the situation is not hopeless for Great Britain, assuming **the continuation of Russian resistance and/or full U.S. participation in the war**.\" >  The crucial factor was the state of the Soviet Union. **If fortune smiles on Russian arms, Germany might yet be prevented from achieving the early and decisive victory essential to the realization of her military and economic objectives**.\u2026. >  Due to the heavy German losses in the fighting in Russia, Smith was optimistic about Germany's inability to reconstitute her military forces for an invasion of England any time in the near future. For the same reasons, Germany could definitely not undertake any major offensive operations in the western hemisphere for at least a year [pessimistically, the spring of 1942, and optimistically, the spring of 1943], and then \"only if she acquires large numbers of British ships, both commercial and war vessels.\"Japan, simultaneously, would presumably attempt to take advantage of a distracted United States and Great Britain, tying down China while going for the resource-rich islands of the southwest Pacific. >  Japan will not take aggressive military steps until favorable conditions for success have been created, when swift blows, timed with Axis operations in the European theater, will be struck\u2026The United States considered Italy an \"increasingly uncomfortable and precarious\" ally (almost, it seems, hoping for a defection), and Vichy France was \u201cdisregarded almost entirely.\u201d The Victory Plan thus assumed **a worst-case scenario of the United States taking on Nazi Germany alone**, and lacking any bases of operation near Europe. **In the best-case scenario (codenamed \u201cRainbow 5\u201d), the United States would be allied with Great Britain and France, and would be able to conduct operations against Germany in Europe and Africa**. The Victory Plan also laid out that the United States, in organizing its military forces, **would not attempt to match Germany man-for-man, but would use their strengths and overwhelming industrial and man power against Germany\u2019s weaknesses**. \u201cRainbow 5\u201d laid out 3 basic war aims for the United States, and along with the \u201c[Plan Dog](_URL_0_)\u201d memo, assumed a strategy of \u201cEurope first,\u201d containing Japan in east Asia until violently dealing with Germany had been completed;* Enforce the [Monroe doctrine](_URL_1_) by defending the western hemisphere from foreign attack.* Protect U.S. possessions in the Pacific and maintain a sufficient force to deter war in the western Pacific.* Create task forces capable of fighting in the Americas, the Caribbean, and...with Great Britain, in Africa, the Mediterranean and Europe.The \u201cPlan Dog\u201d memo took a pessimistic tone, saying that Great Britain would be defeated by Germany without American assistance, and that they were \u201cover-optimistic as to their chances for current success.\u201d The defeat of Germany was advocated by \u201cbombing and economic starvation through the agency of the blockade.\u201d If the eastern Mediterranean (i.e. Egypt and the Suez Canal) was lost to Germany and/or Italy, an advance on Turkey and threat to the Soviet Union's oil supplies in the Caucasus was predicted. The memo also commented on the situation of Japan; they would be stretched thin if they attempted to attack into the southwest Pacific in front of the Soviet Union, China, and the United States. The United States \"would be set back upon [their] haunches, [their] war effort, instead of being widespread, would then have to be confined to the Western Hemisphere.\"Wedemeyer assumed that the Axis (Germany and her allies) could muster a total of 11 to 12 million soldiers in 350-500 divisions by the middle of 1943. In response, the Allies would need to field 700-900 divisions to ensure decisive numerical superiority. As U.S. ground forces were still relatively weak, but increasing in strength, it was estimated that they would not be able to enter the war in any appreciable numbers before mid-1943, and that >  the only effective ally in the European Theater of Operations would be Great Britain, which would have reinforced its armed forces by drawing on the Dominions and India for manpower. Russia would be effectively out of the war, although far eastern Siberia would continue to resist. France would continue...collaboration with Germany. On the positive side, he expected Japan to be...engaged in China and Axis military strength to be...weakened through the economic blockade...air and sea operations, and losses...in the Russian campaign.A consideration as America and Great Britain prepared for war was industrial and agricultural capacity, especially that of the United States, which would limit the amount of men that could be brought under arms. 14 million men of fighting age were available in the United States in mid-1941, but it was estimated that only 12 million could be utilized before disruption of the war economy began to occur; a 25 million-man army would be needed to ensure a 2:1 advantage, and Great Britain could only raise one million more troops discounting the forces needed to protect the Empire, and would need to rely upon her colonial possessions and allies, such as India, Canada, Australia, and South Africa, for any additional manpower.Wedemeyer combined several factors of warfare when laying out a potential troop basis for the United States; firepower, mobility, and air power; namely, flexible, hard-hitting triangular infantry divisions, large numbers of armored forces, and a long-range, heavy-fisted air arm. The Victory Plan also had its faults; the war did not unfold how the United States expected it to, and fundamental changes continuously had to be made in organization and doctrine. The 215-division Army Wedemeyer envisioned only ended up being 90.Type Division|1941 Estimate|Actual:--|:--|:--Armored|61|16Mechanized [motorized infantry]|61|0Infantry|54|66Mountain|10|1Cavalry|4|2Airborne|7|5 >  The dramatic differences between the Victory Plan troop basis and the final shape of the Army in May of 1945 cannot properly be ascribed to errors of judgment, however. The most important changes in divisional organization, division slice factor aside, came about because of logistical and tactical lessons that were unavailable to Wedemeyer in 1941.**Sources:**[\u201cPlan Dog\u201d memo](_URL_0_)Kirkpatrick, Charles E. *An Unknown Future and a Doubtful Present: Writing the Victory Plan of 1941*.

It got a rave review in the then prominent *Sounds* magazine in England: 'the single of this and every other week'. That independent band doing '(I'm) Stranded' wasn't a group from either London or New York, though: they were a group called the Saints, from Brisbane, Australia. And well, Brisbane in 1976 was not the most cosmopolitan place in the world, but Ed Kuepper of the band was apparently crestfallen in mid-1976 when he heard the Ramones' debut album: he thought people would think they were Ramones copyists. What this tells us, crucially, is that New York punk was easy enough to access in faraway Australia; Andrew Stafford in *Pig City* claims that 'the length of time it took for punk to take off in Brisbane [is] approximate to that of a sea-mail subscription of the *NME* to reach the country'. Which is to say that the London and New York punk scenes did not exist in isolation from each other.The New York punk scene based around CBGBs got onto record a little earlier than The Saints. Patti Smith's album *Horses* came out in mid-1975. ['Little Johnny Jewel' by Television](_URL_10_) was released on Ork Records in August 1975, while [the first Ramones single, 'Blitzkrieg Bop',](_URL_3_) was February 1976. [Blondie's 'X Offender'](_URL_9_), in June 1976, beat The Saints by a couple of months. [Talking Heads' 'Love - >  Building On Fire'](_URL_4_) was February 1977.In contrast, the first British punk single is generally agreed to be [The Damned's 'New Rose'](_URL_5_), released in October 1976, a month after '(I'm) Stranded'. The Sex Pistols, who had played their first gig in November 1975, released [their debut single 'Anarchy In The UK'](_URL_0_) in November 1976, while [the Clash's debut single 'White Riot'](_URL_2_) was released in March 1977. Instead of being copyists, The Saints were ...stranded in the wrong place (Brisbane, not London) at the right time.So basically, the New York scene predated the London scene somewhat. And there were connections between the scenes; there was deep interest in American rock in London, and in British rock in New York. Malcolm McLaren, who would later manage the Sex Pistols, spent some time in New York in early 1975 informally managing the group the New York Dolls, who were a bit more rock'n'roll than punk, and who were a bit too big for CBGBs (their first album had been produced by Todd Rundgren, who also produced Meat Loaf's *Bat Out Of Hell* amongst other things). But the New York Dolls were punk adjacent; when Richard Hell left the band Television after 'Little Johnny Jewel', he started a band with former New York Dolls members called The Heartbreakers (NB. Tom Petty wasn't involved in these Heartbreakers). Richard Hell's fashion sense is often credited as the source of the punk style; Malcolm McLaren was very much taken with him, and tried to lure him to England to be the lead singer for the band that would become the Sex Pistols, before they discovered a green haired lout with bad dental hygiene called John Lydon wearing a homemade 'I Hate Pink Floyd' t-shirt and immediately decided he would be the perfect lead singer (Richard Hell famously wore a t-shirt with a target on it and the slogan 'Please Kill Me').However, despite this influence, there were some important differences between London punk and New York punk. The easiest way to explain this is to look at the track lengths of some of the biggest New York punk tracks of the era (excluding the Ramones): Patti Smith's 'Gloria' is about six minutes long. The title track of Television's *Marquee Moon* album [is close to eleven glorious minutes long, full of guitar solos](_URL_1_). Talking Heads' 'Psycho Killer' is more like four and a half minutes long, but was prone to stretching out live. And broadly speaking, New York punk sounds *tense* - it sounds like coiled energy - think, say, 'Psycho Killer', where London punk is energy unleashed.In many ways, New York punk saw the mid-to-late 1960s New York group The Velvet Underground as their benchmark. The Velvet Underground who were (literally) art rock, given that Lou Reed's lyrics often revolved around life at Andy Warhol's Factory, and groups that were in some way in the Velvet Underground's image - The Modern Lovers, the group of Velvets megafan Jonathan Richman, or The Stooges, whose first album was produced by Velvets member John Cale. This is true of the Ramones and Blondie, too, who had a very 'pop art' approach (which is less clear today, in the wake of what came afterwards) - trying to find art in the mundane parts of pop, the 3-minute singles and the rush of excitement of pop; Blondie had originally been a sort of art-pop girl group, while the Ramones emulated the simple pleasures of the 1960s 'garage rock' on the *Nuggets* compilations compiled by Lenny Kaye (Patti Smith's guitarist) - for example, stuff like ['Lies' by the Knickerbockers](_URL_7_).In contrast, the influences on London punk were more immediate and less arty (though ...they weren't un-arty). For a start, those influences included the sound and stance of New York punk, which - as the example of Malcolm McLaren going over to manage the New York Dolls suggests - was probably more interesting to British music magazines than it was to the American public in general. But London punk was also inevitably a reaction to the downfall of glam rock; John Lydon in his autobiography *Rotten* discusses how he liked Bowie a bit, but not that much, but that Sid Vicious was deeply into Bowie's music. Similarly, in the mid-1970s, there was a burgeoning scene in London centered around Canvey Island that got dubbed 'pub rock', in that it tended to be performed in pubs (what the British call bars) rather than concert halls. The most prominent pub rock band, in terms of the influence on punk, is probably Dr. Feelgood (see ['She Does It Right'](_URL_8_), which is more than a little punky for something released in 1975); as a bit of trivia, Dr. Feelgood's guitarist went onto play Ilyn Payne in *Game Of Thrones*. But several prominent London punks - Ian Dury, Joe Strummer, Elvis Costello - played in pub rock bands before making the switch to punk, and The Damned's 'New Rose' - often credited as the first punk single, was produced by Nick Lowe, who'd previously been in a very prominent pub rock band, Brinsley Schwarz.There are also somewhat different socio-political ethoses in New York and London punk, when all is said and done; thanks to Malcolm McLaren, the Sex Pistols were being directed (if not always successfully) by someone with a background in French situationism, as Greil Marcus describes in detail in the book by *Lipstick Traces*; the Sex Pistols' nihilism is in some ways straight from situationism. In contrast, in The Clash, you see somewhat more conventional leftists (who called an album *Sandinista!*, which featured a track called 'Washington Bullets' with lyrics like 'Those Washington bullets want Castro dead/For Castro is the color...That will earn you a spray of lead'). In contrast, New York punk was generally not as self-consciously political; their statements were more social, with more of a focus on gender, decadence, and art. [Early Roxy Music - something like 'Virginia Plain'](_URL_11_) - would have fit in just fine in the New York punk scene, for example.That said, London and New York in the 1970s both felt *miserable*, and this is obviously reflected in the music. In John Lydon's autobiography he claims that  > '...we'd come together out of desperation. There was no hope as far as any of us were concerned. That was the common bond. There was no point in looking for a normal job because that would be just too awful. There was no way out. We had no inspiration, musical or nonmusical, until the band started.' and that > Before the Sex Pistols music was so bloody serious, all run by university graduates...how on earth were we supposed to relate to that music when we lived in council flats? We had no money, no job, no nothing. So the Pistols projected that anger, that rock-bottom working-class hate. I don't think that had ever been dealt with in music outside of a 'show bizzy' way.Not everyone in the punk scene was working class of course. Lydon speaks his frustration about the way the fashionista socialites bought in by Malcolm McLaren and his partner Vivienne Westwood would crowd out the band's more working class fans at early gigs in London. And, of course, the father of Joe Strummer (The Clash) was a diplomat. But politics and class was much closer to the surface of London punk than it was in New York punk.In contrast, the story of New York punk is essentially the story of arty types moving into low-rent areas of the East Side, and writing about their experience; in 1977, the critic Vivien Goldman argued that the likes of the New York punk scene - who were largely white, it should be said - were slowly gentrifying the neighbourhood until there would come a point where the immigrant community could no longer afford to live there.References: * Bryan Waterman (2011) *Marquee Moon* (a book in the 33 1/3 series)* Greil Marcus (1992) *Lipstick Traces** Andrew Stafford (2004) *Pig City** John Lydon with Keith and Kent Zimmerman (1994) *Rotten: No Irish, No Blacks, No Dogs** Legs McNeil and Gillian McCain (1996) *Please Kill Me: The Uncensored Oral History Of Punk*", "label": 0}, {"content": "Punk was a style of music that also incorporates a socio-political ethos, and it emerged on both sides of the Atlantic around the same time; were both groups responding to the same things in the larger culture?

Even today most \"blind\" people are not 100% blind but just have eyesight that can't be corrected into a functional state.So, there are a few important aspects here. One is that modern lifestyles increase the prevalence of poor eyesight. Living indoors and looking at books or screens increases myopia. Not focusing on far away objects outside has an impact on eyesight, so historically people who spent so much time outside would have had lower incidences of myopia.Additionally, there are degrees of poor eyesight. Typical poor eyesight is in the \"things are a bit fuzzier than they should be\" range, not \"can't see at all without glasses\" range. While that would be a quality of life issue, it may not be functionally super important for day to day life in pre-modern times. Reading especially puts a very high burden on eyesight. And driving adds an even greater burden, because it adds the requirement to be able to read signs from far away (due to the speeds involved). Those are unusual requirements, which historically wouldn't have been as relevant.More so, eyesight tends to degrade over time as people get older, and the activities that would be most demanding of good eyesight might typically be done by younger individuals (say, 20s vs. 30s, 40s, or older). Such as fighting in war or hunting.A lot of tasks in pre-literate societies wouldn't have a high requirement for good eyesight. And for those that did, folks who didn't have good eyesight would simply be barred from doing them. Keep in mind that prior to the industrial age the vast majority of the population would have been involved with food production, either farming or herding, neither of which have a particularly hard requirement on good vision.Sadly though, there still would have been some folks who had eyesight that was so poor that it would have rendered them effectively blind though with modern glasses they might have been able to be functional members of society. Those folks would have had a very poor time, and possibly relegated to being taken care of by their communities. Or, in urban environments, becoming beggars. There's a reason why the \"blind beggar\" is such a well-worn trope in fiction and literature, because historically there wasn't much that could be done to help someone with very poor eyesight, and they'd have a hard time making a living.", "label": 0}, {"content": "People with poor eyesight had to wear a patch over their eyes.

Medieval food historian Johanna van Winter, however, has traced the evolution of the word back to the 14th century in Burgundian sources. In 1337 and 1369, at least, a \"banquet\" wasn't a separate meal at all! It was merely an extra last course tacked onto dinner at fancy, multi-day noble/royal feasts. According to Winter, the typical \"dessert\" banquet consisted of a boar's head.By the mid-fifteenth century, however, the meaning of *banquet* had shifted. Banquet had become its own meal! While it had once appended the last big meal of the day, it was now its own big meal, to finish off a night of politicking and drinking and dancing. Furthermore, as the wedding menus Winter studied indicated, it took on a quite different nature from the earlier multi-multi-multi course proper feasts. During the daytime meals, servants would circulate with each course in proper hierarchical order by exquisitely arranged table, codes of manners fully in effect. The nighttime *banquet* was different. All of its food was laid out on tables for guests to select from as they wanted. In some cases, the tables wouldn't even be in the formal dining room at all--perhaps they would be outside under some kind of awning or pavilion-type roof, if the temperature permitted.The food listed in the menus seems like typical feast fare: >  A first dish...a \u2018cretonn\u00e9e de lart\u2019 (veal or kid baked in lard with mashed peas or beans, egg yolks and spices),a stew with cinnamon, and venison with cloves. The second dishmentions peacocks, swans, herons, rabbits with a spiced sauce,and partridges with sugar. The third dish contained stu\ufb00ed caponswith cream, pigeon pie, and kid. For the fourth, we have eagles,pears in spiced sweet wine, gilded slices of sweetmeat, jelly, andcress. The fifth and final dish was cream, almonds, nuts, pears, and sweets.From 1571, a Dutch banquet for a chivalric order's gathering involved: >  the banquet should consist of four dishes with meat in aspic, four dishes with hazelnuts, four disheswith pancakes and wafers, four with baked apples, four with asalad of lettuce or red cabbage, five dishes with sweets, three withthick rice porridge, four with cookies with a hole, and four withchestnuts.As for alcohol? Burgundian Duke Philip the Good hosted a 1454 feast whose banquet starred a perpetual wine fountain.These late medieval and early modern *banquets*, moreover, seem to have developed a reputation for particular gluttony and raucousness. There is a famous allegorical play written around 1480 but not printed until the 16th century called, and needing no translation, *La condemnacion de banquet.* Personified Dinner, Supper, and Banquet are called to account in court for the harm they do to people's lives. The play is partially, maybe mostly, a laundry list of all the horrible maladies caused by gluttony.The verdict? Dinner and Supper are allowed to stay.

Iran even went as far as training Shiite guerilla fighters and sent them across the border into Iraq. For this and other reasons, Saddam invaded Iran. At first he did have difficulty getting his army, which was 80% Shiite, to fight hard. But after 1982 when Iran invaded Iraq the Iraqi army began fighting much harder. This happened for a couple of reasons. First, at this point in the war Saddam recognized that he needed to shore up support if he was going to survive this war, so he reconfigured the government and allowed several Shiites into positions of power. Second, he reformed the army and began paying his troops better. These two things, combined with the fact that they were now defending their own land, motivated the Iraqi Shiites to fight harder.Also, even before the war Saddam recognized that he had to improve his position in southern Iraq, so he spent considerable amounts of the countries income in modernizing that part of the country.In short, before and during the war Saddam was aware of the threat of a revolution in the south, and he took measures to more or less buy off the Shiite community there.

The conscience of political and cultural unity could not realistically anticipate the experience of political unity: how could men who were set apart by geographical borders, by tolls still claimed in a few regions for the surviving local customs inherited by some nobleman, men who rarely communicated with those of the nearby village, families who met only to exercise their skills with the knife... The picture of Italy that appeared to the eyes of a member of the Italian establishment was rather dire. One could wonder if a Neapolitan shop owner would feel anything in common with a Neapolitan land worker - if a Roman citizen would share any common sentiment with one of the day laborers carted over the *Appennini* from the neighboring regions to spend months in the malaria ridden lands, out in the open, until the cart came back to return them to their families. Italy is still full of regional slurs - that share the same take on poverty, misery, ignorance; the same disdain of men uncouth, filthy, despicable - *burini*, *terroni*, *fitusi*. They are all more or less a worse version of redneck; and they show that Italy was divided but also that a Sicilian land owner might have felt more in common with a Venetian one, than he did with the dirty poor people who inhabited his lands.And yet, such a dire picture was not cause of despair. Our Massimo D'Azeglio was a curious example of Italian - son of a Marquis, Cesare, from an old family of the Piedmontese military aristocracy. His father had been a ministry for the King of Piedmont during the years of the French revolution, serving in the ranks of the public administration (with its dialect of course - even Victor Emmanuel III in the 1940s still spoke privately in dialect; a familiar thing). A loyalist, he had escaped with his familiy during the occupation, wandered through Florence and Rome, served as an ambassador to the Pope. Then Massimo had begun his military career in the cavalry cadets, together with the veterans of the Napoleonic campaigns - but more inclined towards the arts he had then moved to Rome, to study painting *dal vivo* (that is learing how to paint scenaries from live observation) and often wandered the countriside, taking residence with local families. He had then moved to Milan, under the Austrian rule, after a parenthesis back in Piedmont where the new King Carlo Felice had begun an absolute restoration. There D'Azeglio wrote a well received national-popular historical novel - *Ettore Fieramosca* on the matter of the \"Challenge of Barletta\" - in Italian of course; and returned then to Rome to try and settle an affair he had there. Disappointed and a bit disillusioned he had then wandered again the country north and south of Rome, gaining somewhat of a reputation for a moderate patriot and a trustworthy man. For this reason ad his frequent travels he had been \"recruited\" for a mission in the Papal States, to contact local notable to support the cause of a \"moderate\" Italian unification, and possibly make use of his contacts with the Piedmontese court. Which resulted in a further season of traveling the country, meeting people and talking to them.That is - for the purpose of this ong digression - that Italians spoke to each other just fine, when they had to. It's just that a lot of them didn't have to. When you consider that still at the beginning of XIX Century, the roads crossing the Basilicata region in the south were so bad that it was convenient for a land owner from Puglia to sell their wheat to Venice - by land first, then sea - rather than carrying it across the region to Naples, and that Naples in turn would import grains from Sicily and North Africa, you have an idea of how limited contacts could be for the people living outside of the major cities. As for them, we do not really know how they felt - if they understood Italy, or Sicily or Palermo, or even thought of a power beyond their local \"baron\". The others; those who could move around, experience more of the world, sooner or later showcased lasting social changes.It's not a coincidence that the most advanced centers of \"political\" activity were the ports of Genoa and Livorno - two major hubs that enjoyed constant traffic from French and British ships - the City of Milan which experienced a central economical role and the cultural inflix of both Paris and Vienna. When Sicily had been subject to the British occupation during the Napoleonic Wars, the chart granted by the military commander Lord Bentinck remained the symbol of a Sicilian autonomy from the mainland - but also for many a moment of formation of a Sicilian identity; that might not have been italian  but was larger than the piece of land they had been tied to since their birth. And if optimism for many of those men was not really warranted - and plenty of disillusionment would follow the unification - it would also be wrong to deny that they did share in fact some common values and ideals. The \"national education\" purpose of the Italian establishment after the unification did not help bring to light those sentiments; if indeed they did exist. And the matter of how the Italian national identity came to be, and came to be negotiated between competing forces immediately after the unification is of absolute complexity and probably the work of one full academic career. But I tried to spotlight the issue that I think was behind your question.In 1849 the people of Rome, in their riots against the Papal Government, still chanted *Viva il Papa! Viva l'Italia!* - we don't know how much of those abstract ideals they understood; perhaps D'Azeglio was right in thinking that the populace had shared little of the grand national inspiration of the political leaders, that they were either too simple (after all the idea that the people might be a subject of political thought did come with the idea that it could be a subject of political authority) or too spoiled from years of corrupt governments... but something of those ideas existed in them; at least for the purpose of expressing their own thoughts. There really could be much more to say on the issue - I'll gladly expand, if I can, and if you have further questions.Sources:Candeloro, G. - Storia dell'Italia modernaDegl'Innocenti, M. - Identit\u00e0 nazionale e poteri locali in Italia tra '800 e '900Degl'Innocenti, M. - La patria divisaRosati, M. - Il Patriottismo italiano", "label": 0}, {"content": "Before Italian unification in 1871, the Italian peninsula was divided into several regions, each with its own language.

In chapter four, Paul addresses the Thessalonians' concerns about \u201cthose who sleep in death\u201d \\(4.13\\). It appears \\(based on Paul's reply; we don't have the letter to which he is responding\\) that the Thessalonians had been given the impression that Christ's second coming was imminent; when members of the community died before Christ's return, the survivors worried that their fallen brothers and sisters would therefore be excluded from the new kingdom. Paul reassures them that > we who are still alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever \\(4.15\\-17\\).In other words, there are contingencies in place for those who succumb to death before the end of the world. There is a plan, Paul reassures them, for an extended wait.Paul also makes the timeline a little more vague. In the next chapter, he reminds the Thessalonians of a particular aspect of his earlier teaching, telling them that \u201cabout times and dates we do not need to write to you, for you know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night\u201d \\(5.1\\-2\\). That is, no one knows when the end will come, as like a thief it will come by surprise. This might strike you as somewhat surprising itself, as speculation about the end of the world typically includes all kinds of signs that indicate *when* the end is nigh \\(cf. 2 Thessalonians 2, where Paul offers a number of signs \\(one reason some scholars doubt its authenticity\\)\\). Why would Paul preach to the Thessalonians that the exact timing of the end of the world is impossible to predict? Well, if the world does not end when he says it will, he's going to have a lot of disappointed people. Better to be vague. This is sometimes referred to as \u201cdelayed eschatology:\u201d The end of the world is DEFINITELY coming, but it's coming at some ill\\-defined point in the future. That way, Christianity can have the end of the world as central to its beliefs without it dominating present considerations.There were many other strategies employed, but these \\( &  the realized eschatology of Luke\\) are the earliest  &  some of the most influential. > At what point was this no longer the predominant expectation of new converts?It's hard to say what the majority of early converts believed, as we simply don't have access to that sort of data. What evidence we do have \u2013\\- a handful of 1st century Christian texts \u2013\\- doesn't express too much interest in imminent eschatology. As 1 Thessalonians suggests, even the earliest converts were dissuaded from thinking of the end of the world as something that would occur soon. Similarly, in 1 Timothy there's lots of talk about establishing a church hierarchy, rearing children, planning for the future, etc. You wouldn't expect Christians to be doing those sorts of things if they thought the world was going to end next week.That said, there's never been a point in Christian history when someone wasn't preaching that the world was about to end. Indeed, this sort of message is especially effective at attracting converts. The problem is that imminent eschatology doesn\u2019t lend itself to the creation of the sort of enduring institutions that a religion needs to grow and prosper. There's an excellent modern example of this in Seventh\\-Day Adventism \\(see Lawson, \u201cThe Persistence of Apocalypticism Within a Denominationalizing Sect\u201d\\): Converts are drawn in with a promise of imminent destruction, but comparatively little is said about the end of the world among established members of the church. It's difficult to get people to plan and build and foster community if they think God is about to wipe everything away.Rather than think of imminent eschatology as a Christian belief that was superseded, then, it might be better to think of it as a persistent Christian belief that is specifically targeted at potential converts. Telling people that the world is about to end is a great way to scare the crap out of them and get them to join, but the messaging usually shifts once they're on the inside.

They centralised rule in Bangkok, a huge difference from the previous political system (which didn't really include a central state as we know it), and set down fixed borders which they then attempted to use against further expansion of French and British colonies. They also created a professional modern military and tried to homogenise the nation through the use of the Thai language etc. This made Siam able to interact with Europeans through the then-conventional methods of diplomacy.

Russia had been anxious for years that Britain or the United States would someday end up seizing Alaska without paying anything. The Russian government probed both governments, but serious attempts to sell Alaska were suspended during the Civil War. Secretary of State William Seward was almost as anxious to buy as Russia was to sell. In 1860, he said this in a speech in Minnesota- > \"I see the Russian, as he busily occupies himself in establishing seaports, and towns, and fortifications on the verge of this continent, as the outposts of St. Petersburg [then the Russian capital]; and I can say: \"Go on, and build up your outposts all along the coast, up even to the Arctic Ocean; they will yet become the outposts of my own country - monuments of the civilization of the United States!\"But a vast new territory north of the Missouri Compromise line was impossible before the Civil War. In 1867, with the war behind and Republican governments installed in the South, Seward's path was clear. Secretary Seward probed the Russian minister to the United States, Eduard de Stoeckl, who in turn forwarded the request to Russia's chancellor Alexander Gorchakov. They soon agreed on a sale. Neither side was extremely worried about price. The final sum was determined with almost ridiculous speed, in a single overnight session between Seward and Stoeckl. The price was never considered on a \"per acre\" basis, but as a gesture which had to seem fair for a territory of that size while still remaining an obvious gesture of friendship from Russia to the United States. Stoeckl suggested $10 million, and Seward countered with $5 million ($167 million and $83.5 million in current dollars, respectively.) Stoeckl came back with $7.5 million, and Seward offered $7 million. Stoeckl mentioned the Russian Fur Company still had vast interests throughout the territory, so Seward tacked on another $200,000 so the Russian government could liquidate the company and include its assets as part of the sale. The two men shook on the price of $7.2 million and that was that.Most of these details I took from *Seward at Washington as Senator and Secretary of State*, a book compiled by Seward's son Frederick W.

The problem is just how often the casualties numbers change. When World War 2 ended it was estimated that there were just over 3 million German soldiers dead. However, numerous studies after the war, the most notable being the \"Overmans study\", showed that the German high command's numbers were incorrect. The new number for German military dead was now over 5 million as estimated by Overman. This new number of 5 million is generally supported by historians. David Glantz in his book \"When Titans Clashed\" puts the total German casualties (including wounded) at over 11 million (6 million wounded, 5 million dead). 11 million was 75% of the entire German Army and 46% of the German male population in 1939. Now it gets even trickier. Do you factor POWs who would later die into the kill count? If you do than get ready for more issues. Some historians assert that as many as 1 million of the over 2 million German POWs taken by the Soviet Union died. Others assert that only around 500,000 of the German POWs. Not to mention the POWs who died in American and British captivity, (a very small number when compared to the amount that died in Soviet captivity, somewhere in the 10,000 range). But of course we aren't just talking about military dead. So lets add some more confusion into the mix. West German reports put the total amount of civilians killed by Strategic bombing at over 500,000. But Richard Overy, a respected historian who has wrote on the bombing of Germany, argues that the 500,000 number is based off inflated Nazi reports and that the real number of civilians killed by strategic bombing is just over 350,000. Now I won't touch on the subject of German expulsions since that happened after were World War 2 (though it started as early as 1944-1945) and that would just add to the mess of numbers as those numbers are more heavily disputed than the rest of them. Some say as many as 2 million Germans were killed others will go as low as around 300,000-500,000.So as you see pinning down exact numbers in a conflict like World War Two is next to impossible. But if we just count military deaths. We are looking at around 5.3 million Germans dead. With another 10 million held in POW camps most of whom wouldn't be released until the late 1940's in the case of the allies and as late as the early 1950's in the case of the Soviet Union. The 5.3 million includes those who never returned from captivity. That being said its difficult to calculate the amount of German soldiers who died in the battles in late 1945 because there was no way to report them. This is why most historians who write about casualties will paint with very broad strokes, most will say over \"4 million\" dead braver ones will say \"over 5 million\". The breakdown of communications and reporting in Germany in 1945 makes getting an accurate number near impossible. The population of Germany took a major hit. 46% of the 1939 male population was either dead or seriously wounded. The German population was now close to the number it had been at the turn if the century. The German population had been nearly 80 million in 1939 and it was about 65 million (both Germanys) in 1946, but this number could be heavily disputed. In 1950 the newly founded West Germany had about 51 million people. With 4 million more women than men. The GDR was trailing with about 18 million people.

Philip Zimbardo was the researcher who put together the famous (and ethically troublesome) Stanford Prison Experiment in 1971 ([which Maria Konnikova at the *New Yorker* explains well here](_URL_0_)). Let me reiterate - this had nothing to do with Kaczynski. However, what's fascinating about the Stanford Prison Experiment is that Zimbardo details in the book *The Lucifer Effect* the ethical hoops that he had to jump through for the experiment to take place:  >  The legal counsel of Stanford University was consulted, drew up a formal \u201cinformed consent\u201d statement, and told us of the work, safety, and insurance requirements we had to satisfy for them to approve the experiment. The \u201cinformed consent\u201d statement signed by every participant specified that during the experiment there would be an invasion of his privacy; prisoners would have only a minimally adequate diet, would lose some of their civil rights, and would experience harassment. All were expected to complete their two-week contract to the best of their ability. The Student Health Department was alerted to our study and prior arrangements were made for any medical care subjects might need. Approval was officially sought and received in writing from the agency sponsoring the research, the Group Effectiveness Branch of the Office of Naval Research (ONR), the Stanford Psychology Department, and Stanford\u2019s Institutional Review Board (IRB).Zimbardo is telling us this in *The Lucifer Effect* because he wants to come across as someone who had been trying to do the right thing in his research, rather than the manipulative unethical devil that some had portrayed him as for putting together the experiment. He is trying to argue that he went through the proper channels and that he wasn't a loose cannon doing crazy experiments that nobody knew about. Instead, he later says, his ethical lapse was in not realising the way that the combination of group identification and some sociopathic tendencies in some participants would be so explosive - the experiment had unintended consequences.Anyway, the mid-1970s marks the point when the current, quite stringent ethics boards system and the principles under which it works ('informed consent') became the done thing across universities in the West. Zimbardo's experiment happened at the absolute tail end of the 'wild west' era of psychology experiments, and I think became prominent because it was a recent example at this point, not because it was necessarily the worst ethical violation in university history.The year after Zimbardo's experiment was conducted saw the publication of the psychiatrist Jay Katz's book *Experimentation In Human Beings*, which exhaustively researched the ethical lapses of previous research, and which was influential in psych- circles. And then news broke in the popular press about the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, where - in what is now very widely seen as a horrific experiment, the US Public Health service basically left syphilis in black men untreated between 1932 *and 1972* to monitor the effects (penicillin had become available in the 1940s). This experiment only stopped in 1972 because it was exposed by a whistleblower.Faden  &  Beauchamp's 1986 book *A History And Theory Of Informed Consent* says that: > \"Informed consent\" first appeared as an issue in American medicine in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Prior to this period, we have not been able to locate a single substantial discussion in the medical literature of consent and patient authorization. For example, from 1930 to 1956 we were able to find only nine articles published on issues of consent in the American medical literature. Medical ethics and medical policy\u2014as reflected in codes, treatises, and actual practices\u2014were almost entirely developed within the profession of medicine, which was little distracted by canons of disclosure and consent.Which is to say that the ethical considerations that are implicit in the hoops that researchers have to jump through in order to do research on humans only really started to be thought about by medical researchers in the late 1950s and early 1960s.  However, it took until the 1970s and the publicising of the Tuskegee experiment for official national American policies to be drawn up. In 1974, the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research was instituted, and over the next four or five years, it created and published official policies that research needed to abide by. These revolved around 'informed consent' (e.g., that people had to consent to participate in experiments, and that this consent needed to be informed by a full knowledge of the possible harms that may result from the experiment - and so the Stanford Prison Experiment was unethical because the participants were not informed of the possible harms that resulted from the experiment, because Zimbardo himself didn't realise them).Psychologists, though, *aren't* medical researchers - psychiatrists are medical doctors who specialise in mental illness, but psychologists are scientists of the mind. The popular image of psychologists is as involved in the treatment of depression etc (which they are), but psychology is a broader field that also does - for example - social psychology research into how people behave in groups more generally (e.g., in the Stanford Prison Experiment) or on colour perception. As a result, the story of the ethical expectations that Henry Murray (the psychological researcher who experimented on Kaczynski) would have been expected to follow in 1960 is a bit different to the medical context. The American Psychological Association put together a taskforce in 1938 that reported on whether they should have an official ethics code in 1939: in summary, they \"did not feel that the time was ripe for the Association to adopt a formal code\".However, post-war, with a boom in the amount of psychologists, it was decided that an ethics code was needed after all (but which mainly dealt with the ethics of clinical psychology and treating people for depression, something which is a thorny ethical issue in many ways, but in different ways to research). A draft of this code, published in 1951, stated that:  > Only when the problem being investigated is significant and can be studied in no other way is the psychologist justified in withholding information from or temporarily giving misinformation to research subjects or in exposing them to emotional stress. He must seriously consider the possibility of harmful after-effects, take all necessary steps to remove the possibility of such effects when they may be anticipated,and deal with them if and when they arise. Where there exists a danger of serious after-effects, research should not be conducted unless the subjects are fully informed of this possibility and volunteer nevertheless.This was published in 1953 as: > 4.31-1 Only when a problem is significant and can be investigated in no other way is the psychologist justified in exposing research subjects to emotional stress. He must seriously consider the possibility of possible harmful after-effects and should be prepared to remove them as soon as permitted by the design of the experiment. When the danger of serious after-effects exists, research should be conducted only when the subjects or their responsible agents are fully informed of this possibility and volunteer nevertheless. > 4.31-2 The psychologist is justified in withholding information from or giving misinformation to research subjects only when in hisjudgment this is clearly required by his research problem, and when the provisions of the above principle regarding protection of the subjectsare adhered to.However, this clearly did not stop a range of ethically problematic psychology research in the 1950s and 1960s - including Murray's, and including the Milgram Experiment - from occurring; these were ethical guidelines that were not very strictly enforced at all, rather than something that the APA was emphasising.In the early 1970s, the APA started to take this more seriously, and in 1973 they published the following principle: > Principle 5.111 > *It is unethical to involve a person in research without his prior knowledge and informed consent.* [Italics in original] > A. This principle may conflict with the methodological requirement of research whose importance has been judged by the investigator (Principle 1.12), with the advice of an ethics advisory group (Principle 1.2), to outweigh the costs to the subject of failing to obtain his informed consent. Conducting the proposed research in violation of this principle may be justified only when: >  1. it may be demonstrated that the research objectives cannot be realized without the concealment, >  2. there is sufficient reason for concealment so that when the subject is later informed, he can be expected to find the concealment reasonable and so suffer no serious loss of confidence in the integrity of the investigator or others involved in the situation, >  3. the subject is allowed to withdraw his data from the study if he so wishes when the concealment is revealed to him, >  4. the investigator takes full responsibility for detecting and removing stressful aftereffects (Principles 1.72 and 1.73) and for providing the subject with positive gain from the research experience (Principles 1.741, 1.742, and 1.743).So it's only in 1973 that psychological researchers were effectively mandated to get permission for their research from an ethics advisory group like an IRB.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Harvard experiment was conducted in the late 1950s, before the emergence of the American Psychological Association.

Generalmajor Mueller-Hillebrand reported in a post-war interrogation that 12545 tanks and SPGs were \"ready to use\" as of March 1945, plus over 800 vehicles deemed worthy only for security service and training, so that's a fairly realistic number. Presumably the Western Allies captured a good number of tanks as well, but I don't have those counts. Some adjustments must also be made for \"creative accounting\" (for instance, looking at the number of Tiger II tanks lost reveals that the losses reported by the Generalmajor are vastly incomplete), but a few thousand leftover vehicles would be realistic.The French also operated a battalion of 50 Panther tanks after the war, which would mean that these were 50 tanks deemed suitable for post-war service. Presumably a whole lot more were captured that were not suitable. The British also captured entire factories, with \"gently used\" and brand new Panthers sent back to Britain for testing, in addition to inspection of hulls in various stages of manufacture.Sources:Y.

The Compton's Cafeteria riot in 1966 San Francisco, and the raid and resulting protests at the famous Black Cat Cafe in Los Angeles, New Year's 1967, are probably the most well known today. So a consideration of \"why Stonewall\" has to be surprisingly fine-tuned! In scholarship, historians have tended to emphasize context more, and sociologists the qualities of the event itself, but they don't fundamentally disagree. So we'll take both views together, and place it all in light of the radicalization of social activism at the end of the 1960s.By the mid-1960s, there were \"homophile\" groups all across the U.S., many under the umbrella of the Mattachine Society or Daughters of Bilitis but all local in governance and activism. They held annual conferences of sorts, national or regional, like the Eastern Regional Conference of Homophile Organizations. Founded in the early 1950s, homophile groups sought legitimacy for gay men and lesbians in the eyes of society and in their own eyes. (n.b. Everything I've read suggests that trans women were generally lumped in with gay men insofar as being targeted by cops, and trans men are generally absent from prehistories/histories of Stonewall). The idea was to bring LGBT people together, provide basic education about things like homosexuality not being a mental illness, and develop and propagate an \"ethical homosexual culture\"--*homophile* using one Greek word for 'love' to get away from the idea of gay people obsessed with sex.And respectability was key--Harry Hay, the founder of the Mattachine Society, was essentially kicked out of the organization in 1953 when his CP-USA affiliation became a liability for Mattachine. The organization was to be for education, not activism.But in the early/mid 1960s, a handful of younger LGBT community members took inspiration from the nonviolent but militant African-American civil rights movement. And they found a few ways to start making their voices heard. Barbara Gittings (NYC) became the editor of the DOB's *The Ladder* in 1962; Frank Kameny (DC) wormed his way into an invitation to deliver a key public lecture to the NYC Mattachine Society; Julian Hodges put together a whole slate of militant activists to run for Mattachine-New York's board in 1965. The militants pushed hard for coverage in national, straight-dominated media. They also had one particular vision, historian David Carter stresses, that their predecessors had feared: public demonstrations.They were still cagey: the first demonstrations were against LGBT persecution in *Cuba* in 1965, held as picket lines in front of the White House and the U.N.--and then at a number of other sites in Washington. The pickets went fine as pickets, but they were probably more important emotionally for the activists involved. They decided to make them a recurring event.Called \"Annual Reminders,\" these were picket lines on and in where the U.S. was born--Philadelphia, July 4th. And keeping in line with the civil rights activism in the mid-1960s that got more positive press, the Annual Reminders stressed *respectability.* There was a strict dress code (coat and tie for men...yes, outdoors, in July), a ban on hand-holding, march single-file, no protest chants, and so forth. LGBT community members on the mid-1960s West Coast, on the other hand, got boisterous in their protests on police raids, including clubs frequented by (what were then seen as) men cross-dressed as women. But they had problems gaining traction nonetheless. First, there was less inter-city organization, both in terms of organizations and in terms of media. Newsletters went to local readers only. Second, the LA and SF communities faced police brutality on a level even the East Coasters didn't see--an East Coast militant remarked in 1969 that the \"LA gays have been foundering, stunned by the reign of terror which the LAPD has brought on them.\"  Sociologists Elizabeth Armstrong and Suzanna Crage argue that there was a background atmosphere of hopelessness in the West that hadn't fully developed in the East, despite the in-the-moment revolting of local communities in response to specific acts of violence.So then we come to summer 1969--on the other side of the rise of the Black Panthers, radical feminism, the 1968 riots. Other fields of activism saw militance winning out over conservative approaches. The LGBT community, as I mentioned earlier, was still torn between radical militants and those who believed quiet respectability was the key.Stonewall changed that.The first big reason is timing. The riots took place at the end of June--a week before the 1969 Annual Reminder. When the East Coast gay community arrived at Philadelphia for the staid, quiet picket line, there was a fire that had been repressed in earlier years: >  For half an hour Craig [Rodwell] marched in silence in the terrible heat, with no shade, clad in a suit and tie...Then he noticed that two young women right in front of him were simultaneously breaking two of the picket demonstration\u2019s rules: they were not marching single file and they were holding hands. Craig was just thinking, *Oh-h-h, isn\u2019t that wonderful!* when Frank Kameny, his face red as a beet, moved in between the two women and Craig and with a karate-chop blow broke their hands apart, saying, \u201cNone of that! None of that!\u201d >  Furious, Craig immediately convinced about ten couples he had brought from New York to march holding hands. Bill Weaver scratched out the bland slogan on his picket sign and scrawled: \u201cSMASH SEXUAL FASCISM!\u201d on it. >  *-from David Carter's \"Stonewall\"*That would be the last Annual Reminder in classic form--no more dress codes and bans on PDA. Just as important, it was the last one on July 4th. The organizers decided to move the event to late June to mark the Stonewall riots, which were on everyone's minds at the time.The second big reason is the media, and there are a couple factors in play here. One, the Stonewall riots themselves were mediagenic. The escalation midway through wasn't just making a bigger splash--it showed a *victory*, that the police couldn't contain the rioters like they were able to in the West Coast examples mentioned earlier. There was a clear narrative, an obvious bad guy versus the plucky underdogs, a stage at the heart of NYC LGBTQ life. This is also a factor in why the Annual Reminder was moved to commemorate Stonewall in the first place.Two, there was, if you will, media for them to be genic in. Mattachine-NYC and the DOB-NYC had connections with the NY Times, Harper's, and other national, mainstream media outlets in addition to community-specific publications with wider circulation. Craig Rodwell was apparently *all over* local journalists, pressuring them to print the story. Not that the coverage was at all flattering or just to the trans and LGB rioters, but at least it was coverage. The third major reason is organization. The East Coast umbrella meta-organization I mentioned earlier, ERCHO, had the authority over local groups to do things like move the Annual Reminder to June and to NYC+other cities (Chicago and LA at first, eventually San Francisco and smaller ones).The fourth major reason is legal. Over late 1969 and early 1970, the LGBT communities fought and fought court battles to gain legitimacy for their June commemorative parade/march/demonstration. These first Pride parades wouldn't be the conservative office attire no touching zones of the Annual Reminders, but the organizers were also determined that they would not be violent. They would be commemorations of the Stonewall riots, not more riots. So the parades had police *protection*--prohibiting backlash from the wider community, opening the first paths for collaboration between the LGBT community and the police, and leading to *positive* news coverage.Overall, thus far, there is a lot to be said that the Stonewall raid and riots just occurred at the right time in the right environment of activism and media connections. But folded into the context are critical points that: it was a specific event to anchor and focus future actions; it was seen as a victory rather than a defeat; the location at the heart of NYC's trans and LGB scene gave it an immediate emotional resonance and the actual presence of some of the most radical activists.A final point to consider is the (then) future of Stonewall commemoration. All wrapped up into the lead-in, the riots, and the aftermath was the creation of two crucial LGBT community institutions: the Gay Liberation Front, which poised LGBTQ activism towards *rights*, and *The Advocate*, a truly national LGBT advocacy and news publication. Historian Carter emphasizes the role of Stonewall in creating/reinforcing LGBTQ community leaders; sociologists Armstrong and Crage stress the attraction of *parades* as a vehicle for historical memory and community consolidation.And I think, in the end, there are two final takeaways as to \"why Stonewall\" in the LGBTQ emotional universe: first, the annual commemorations were expressed on and in LGBTQ terms, not according to the norms of an oppressive heterosexual majority. Second, they became, and remain, first and foremost a *celebration*.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Stonewall Riots are generally considered the beginning of the modern LGBT rights movement, but gay rights groups had existed long before 1969. What made the post-Stonewall revolution so impactful and what changed to make gay rights movements more cohesive and vocal?", "label": 1}, {"content": "In 1961, the medical journal *Lancet* formally christened Down's Syndrome with its now-standard name. Many options had been proposed to replace the previous standard of \"mongolism\" or \"mongoloid child,\" a movement that reflect both increasing discomfort with the racist tone of the previous name and the increasing medical research that flowed out of the birth of genetics. But the timing of the shift also reflected the growing presence of DS and other developmental disabilities (DD) in public conversation overall. Although this is most famously associated with John F. Kennedy's publicity and policy efforts, he acted not just out of family history but  of a growing zeitgeist that things could have gone differently.Stephen Gelb argues that World War II was a critical focal point in consolidating and validating earlier perspectives on DD. In the earlier 20th century, state and educational authorities had began to place a lot of emphasis on distinguishing \"trainable\" children from the severely disabled. Small-scale experiments of young adults \"paroled\" from asylums to live in group homes and work in the community had gone well during the 1920s, but the Great Depression and its high unemployment rates triggered their closure. World War II was the opposite. Residential schools found it *great* PR to publicize stories of their male students who ran away and joined the Army. Gelb points out that black teenagers on the cusp of recruitment age were *100 times less likely* to be declared \"mentally deficient\" than Southern black boys in late 1970s schools (a statistic which reflects the entrenched racism in special education. Black males were still more likely than white males to be excused from the WWII draft on grounds of mental deficiency.) Lowered standards for entering the Army came with efforts to raise even the rejected to a 'sufficient' level through remedial education. People previously considered unemployable also found significant--and publicized--success working in wartime factories and farms.Underlying these developments are an important fact. The scandalous history of early asylums and the eugenics movements has granted residential schools (and \"schools\") for disabled people primacy of place in the American historical consciousness. But those institutions *vastly* underserved the number of adults and children with disabilities. Waiting lists for entry could be staggering. In early 20th century England, at least, the government even found itself subsidizing community \"guardians\"--including parents--in raising children with DD. Children with DD, including DS, had always been present in private homes. The efforts of WW2-era soldiers and workers--and the visibility of those efforts, often in service of patriotism--contributed to a growing acceptance of the presence of people with DS in families and communities. As educational psychologist and advocate for people with DS Lloyd Yepsen noted in 1945, \"Many institutions display service flags with blue and gold stars upon them...*more importantly*, they hang in the windows of many homes across the nation.\"Resulting, the 1950s witnessed a glacial, but appreciable, increase in resources for parents of \"mongoloid\" children. It's true that in most cases, in most places, school districts found ways to exclude children with DD from their programming (often finding their loophole in attendance requirements). In 1959, there were only something like 9000 DS children known to attend public education classes of some sort.But things were beginning to shift. The two most important developments, for a parent of a DS child born in 1959, would have been the 1950s growth of university programs in special education (for future teachers) and the blossoming of parents' groups. The first reflected new perspectives on child psychology and development that emphasized the importance of *nurture* and intervention in shaping outcomes for children, including those with DD. Methodology was not where it is today, of course, but the programs and their graduates represent the beginnings of a paradigm shift and the slow growth of resources.At the level of the family, things were also shifting. Dale Evans and Roy Rogers famously chose to raise their daughter with DS, Robin, at home rather than follow the doctors' prescription of institutionalization. Of course, they were movie stars with ample help, and their daughter tragically died at age 2. But they were a widely publicized (and self-publicized) case that helped assert a positive: families could raise their DS children without being \"inevitably\" rent apart, as contemporary thought had it.Parenting groups for support and eventually activism picked up speed in the 1950s, after the initial founding in 1946 New Jersey. The various *ARC organizations which still represent people with DD today are the modern evolution of an association of regional and local parents' groups, mostly in New England, that came together in 1951.A lot of these early associations' importance lay in the sphere of sociability and *play*. Fathers' groups helped fund and build playgrounds at residential schools while mothers' groups organized transportation for weekly visits (and, importantly, *visitations*--many meeting minutes reflect the need to oversee conditions to make sure their children were sufficiently happy even when the families could not be present). Social events like dances, holiday parties, and summer vacation trips were crucial for families both internally and externally. On one hand, they offered parents and siblings as well as children with DD a release from some of the normal stresses of everyday life; on the other, they showed how families with DD children were really \"just like any other family.\"Education was a major point of activism and organization for the parents' groups. Laura Blossfield, who founded the initial group, sought to make regular school attendance the shining goal of DS/DD activism. Not only did they lobby governments, but they raised money to privately fund classrooms and school programs for their exceptional children! Parents' groups also sought to organize day-care settings for children with more severe disabilities.I don't want to paint too bright a picture. These parents' groups were very heavily white and middle class. They were typically limited to parents who had *time* and *money* for activism. A lot of their driving rhetoric draws on the criticisms of \"1950s domesticity\" that Friedman slaughtered in *The Feminine Mystique*, which unfortunately reified \"white middle class\" as the unspoken qualifiers of *woman*. Like the institutions they meant to support and supplant, parents' groups and residential programs for \"trainable\" children could only ever serve a sliver of the population in desperate need of services. The strain of raising a child with significant health challenges tore apart families then as it does now. Non-white and/or immigrant children stood a higher chance of being tagged as \"mentally deficient\" for purposes of social isolation, including in early state-run special education settings.Still, parents of 1959 choosing to raise their developmentally disabled child at home, if they were socially privileged and geographically lucky, for the first time might have had both community tools and the beginnings of a shift in social attitudes on their sides.", "label": 0}, {"content": "In 1959, the American Medical Association recommended that children with Down syndrome be institutionalized.

The Carolingian army wasn't a standing army by any means.  At its most basic the Carolingian war machine functioned via yearly levies of both aristocrats and their direct supporters on the one hand and of \"freemen\" on the other. Freemen would owe fines if they didn't show up, for instance, but again these are not professional soldiers but rather men who are expected to keep weapons as part of their (legal)status as free Franks.  A yearly muster is referenced many times in the *Royal Frankish Annals* where the army (or armies in many cases) would gather in the spring and then be dispatched.  It also wasn't professional in the sense of career soldiers, unless, I suppose, you want to broadly paint the aristocracy as such, but in that case there is little to distinguish them from later counterparts. On the whole armies were supported not by \"wages\" but by spoils, this is one reason why pitched battles seem fairly rare in the Carolingian annals and instead we see a focus on \"wasting\" and \"sacking\" enemies such as the Saxons, Avars etc.  Plunder would trickle down from Charlemagne to his highest aristocrats and so forth down the line.  That being said, there is also reference to payment meant to support the army, something like a living wage presumably.  Specific capitularies (legislative codes essentially) reference a \"fine\" (or a tax I suppose) being levied on various property levels that would be used to support the \"host.\"  In this was we can see that the efforts to centralize and actively legislate and maintain the realm lend it a more \"professional\" feeling than later armies might have.  Likewise, those holding land from the king/emperor would be expected as part of the arrangement to supply soldiers as well.  So, for instance, the so-called *Capitulary for the Missi on Mobilizing the Army* issued in 808 states that: > Every free man who has four *mansi* [a unit of land] of his own property, or has a benefice from anyone [land granted as gift or in return for service], shall equip himself and go to the army, either with his lord, if the lord goes, or with his count.  He who has three *mansi* of his own property shall be joined to a man who has one *mansus*, and shall aid him so that he may serve for both.We also have legislation (capitularies) that reference a system by which villages would be required to band together in order to support a specific number of soldiers without denuding themselves of able bodied men for the harvest (always a concern). So, for instance,   In these cases, for instance, 5 families would be required to arm and support a sixth person while to went off to fight.  The *Capitulary on a Variety of Subjects* (great name!) from 807 states that: > If it shall be necessary to furnish aid against the Saracens of Spain, or the Avars, then five of the Saxons [by this point part of the Empire] shall equip a sixth.So where the Frankish advantage comes from is a combination of a fairly (for the period) high level of centralized control with active legislation and organization, the sheer size/manpower, and technology (better weapons etc.).  It also had a driving *need* for pretty constant warfare to keep wealth coming in, to keep aristocrats busy (and thus not fighting with each other), and to affirm the place of the king as warrior and gift-giver.The definitive texts on Carolingian warfare are by Bernard Bachrach and they go into lots of detail, though he leans towards a layer of sophistication/organization that not everyone agrees with.  There is some debate, for instance, about how well enforced the various laws we see are or whether they were largely aspirational in nature.You can also gain easy access to a lot of great primary sources in translation if you want to encounter the Carolingians for yourself.*The Royal Frankish Annals,* *The Annals of Saint-Bertin,* and *The Annals of Fulda* are all available in translation.  There is also a great source book from Toronto Press called *Carolingian Civilization* that has lots of neat snippets of lots of types of texts.edit:  Made some edits for more details, clarity etc!

So here are some facts along with a little speculation.Replacing one's birth, or slave name, with an X was a tradition within the Nation of Islam.  The Nation of Islam was a religious sect headed by a man named Elijah Muhammad (born Elijah Poole) at the time Malcolm joined.  Though they followed the Koran and maintained many of the trappings of Islam, it was disavowed by most orthodox Muslims at the time Malcolm was a part of it.  Less widely known is that many Nation of Islam members also took the name \"Shabazz\".  Malcolm, for instance, married Betty Shabazz and also used the name Malik al-Shabazz at other times in his life.  This is all to say \"X\" names were common in the Nation of Islam as it was expected of anyone who truly believed Elijah Muhammad was Allah's final messenger.Without a doubt, it was Malcolm himself who popularized the \"X\".  His brief but hugely important time in the national media spotlight in the early 1960s diffused Nation of Islam teaching and ideology much further than it had ever gone before.  Most estimates put membership in the Nation of Islam in the early to mid-50s in the hundreds.  By the early 1960s there were tens of thousands of followers (estimates vary widely but a Malcolm biographer puts the number at 75,000 by this time).  Out of 22 million African-Americans in the country then that number is pretty small. Malcolm's many media appearances reached millions more...all over the world really.  He was routinely brought on television and radio to be the voice of militant black America - usually to debate non-violent civil rights activists.  This is a big part of Malcolm's media profile but he had many more dimensions to his personality and intellect than just anger and outrage.As for why this trend didn't catch on (this is the speculative part) the simplest theory is because the Nation of Islam never commanded a broad following in the African-American community...even at its height.  Its media profile far outstripped its actual following particularly when Malcolm was alive.  When Malcolm was assassinated the media spotlight that had shown on the Nation of Islam dimmed.  To make matters worse the murder was carried out by Nation of Islam members as Malcolm had, by 1964, split with the Nation of Islam and denounced Elijah Muhammad as a liar and hypocrite.  Undoubtedly, this further reduced the appeal of the Nation of Islam to the vast majority of African-Americans and with it naming conventions like the \"X\".  Most African-Americans were Christians.  They may have been intrigued by people like Malcolm X but that didn't mean they wanted to join the Nation of Islam (or take a name that made them look like they were members).Interestingly, the \"X\" has become something of a media phenomena - a symbol of Malcolm's ideas and personality more than the simple religious tradition it started off as.As for sources, I have spent several months researching Malcolm for my work.  I've watched hours and hours of his media appearances and read quite a lot.  Here are a few options for further reading from which most of this answer was drawn:[Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention - Manning Marable](_URL_0_)[The Autobiography of Malcolm X: As Told to Alex Haley](_URL_1_)[By Any Means Necessary - Malcolm X: Real, Not Reinvented](_URL_2_)I am not a professional historian so I welcome an actual scholar's opinion on this subject.

Everett argues that the song goes back at least to the mid-19th century. The song is certainly mentioned several times in literature before it gets the chance to be recorded. The first mention of the song might be in [an 1882 novel by Louise Clarke Pyrnelle](_URL_0_), which was inspired by her pre-Civil War plantation childhood in Alabama (she was born in 1850, and white). At one point in the novel she relays the lyrics that the slaves sing while one slave called 'Old Sambo' plays fiddle: >  Cotton-eyed Joe, Cotton-eyed Joe >  What did make you sarve me so >  Fur ter take my gal erway fum me >  An' cyar he plum ter Tennessee? >  Ef it hadn't ben fur Cotton-eyed Joe >  I'd er been married long ergo >  HIs eyes wuz crossed, an' his nose wuz flat, >  An' his teef wuz out, but wat uv dat? >  Fur he wuz tall, an' he wuz slim >  An so my gal she follered him >  Ef it hadn't ben fur Cotton-eyed Joe >  I'd er ben married long ergo.Dorothy Scarborough, a white Texan, relays a similar version in her 1925 book *On The Trail Of Negro Folk Songs*. Scarborough's published version is an amalgam of different versions from Texas, Louisiana and one sent to her by someone with a pen name; one suspects it's not impossible that Pyrnelle's published version influenced her. Nonetheless, Scarborough said of the song that: > A less comely person of a different sex is celebrated or anathematized in another song [i.e., Cotton Eyed Joe], which seems to be fairly well known in the South, as parts of it have been sent in by various persons. According to the testimony of several people who remember events before the [Civil] war, this is an authentic slavery-time song. The air and some of the words were given to me by my sister, Mrs. George Scarborough, as learned from the Negroes on a plantation in Texas, and other parts by an old man in Louisiana, who sang it to the same tune. He said he had known it from his earliest childhood and had heard the slaves sing it on plantations. A version was also sent by a writer whose pen name is Virginia Stait.According to Scarborough, Cotton-Eye Joe is a hoodoo man who travels with a travelling medicine show: >  Dat gal, she sho' had all my love,  >  An' swore fum me she'd never move,  >  But Joe hoodooed her, don't you see,  >  An' she run off wid him to Tennessee.  >  I'd 'a' been married forty year ago  >  Ef it had n't a-been for Cotton-eyed Joe!A 1922 book by an African-American chemistry professor named Thomas Talley, called *Negro Folk Rhymes*, tried to collect the lyrics of his Shelbyville, Tennessee childhood, and his version of 'Cotton Eyed Joe' is a little different to Pyrnelle's and Scarborough's, but identifiably the same song - notably, the Tennessean Talley doesn't mention the line about Cotton Eyed Joe moving to Tennessee:  >  Oh, it makes dem ladies love me so, >  W'en I comes 'roun' pickin' ole Cotton Eyed Joe. >  Yes, I'd a been married some forty years ago,  >  If I hadn' stay's home wid Cotton Eyed Joe.The first extant recordings of the song were recorded very soon after record companies realised that rural folk music could make money (and after it became possible to record relatively quiet music using electrical recording). The [Dykes Magic City Trio appear to have been the first to record it in 1927](_URL_4_), while there were 5 other recordings of the song in the next couple of years - suggesting that at this point it was a very popular song amongst rural folk musicians.Everett identifies there being three variant versions of the song. Remember, of course, that before the advent of recording, and before anybody had any interest whatsoever in commercially marketing folk tunes, that folk songs circulated when one person taught it or even just played it to another; often the folk musicians doing this were illiterate. As a result, folk tunes often have variant versions which have diverged from each other in important ways, and the places where those variant versions are found, and the degrees of variation can give some clues as to the ways that the songs have been altered to suit different situations and purposes, and perhaps the origins of the songs. Everett argues that there are southeastern, southwestern and Acadian versions of Cotton Eyed Joe. The Southeastern versions of the song, such as that by the Dykes Magic City Trio, are the first to be recorded. However, the more famous versions are Southwestern versions, such as the [1940s version by Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys](_URL_1_); it's the Southwestern version that the version by the 1990s Swedish dance act Rednex derives from. Finally, there's a Canadian variant of the song, [associated with Don Messner](_URL_3_), which is usually an instrumental fiddle tune in the Acadian style; this version seems to have spread to northern American states like North Dakota.Everett argues that the southeastern version is likely the original - it certainly feels less garbled than the southwestern version of Bob Wills, which is much more nonsensical - e.g., \"I fell down and stubbed my toe, send for the doctor, Cotton-Eyed Joe\". Anyway, Rednex's 1995 version is very clearly a sort of kitschy parody of country dance music set to modern electronic beats; the group have stereotypically Southern American clothing and indeed indeed stereotypical names like 'Mary Jo' and 'Billy Ray'. In a funny way, Rednex's kitsch *does* get across what was one of the main purposes of the song in the 19th century and early 20th century would have been: it was likely a common minstrel song (though I can't find specific primary evidence of this). Nonetheless, it's very likely indeed that, if an African-American folk song was spread throughout the South of the USA widely enough to basically be a rural standard amongst white people, that it was spread by minstrel shows - minstrel shows were a dominant form of entertainment in America (and Australia for that matter) for almost a century.Except that where Rednex is Swedish people making fun of the white American South based on what are probably offensive stereotypes, 'Cotton-Eyed Joe' as a minstrel song was the white American South making fun of the black American South based on what are definitely offensive stereotypes. Additionally, it may or may not be a coincidence that Pyrnelle's 'Old Sambo' also happens to be the name of a minstrelsy stereotype - I wouldn't be surprised if Pyrnelle knew the song through a more recent minstrel show rather than her childhood. There's perhaps some bitter irony there.So, 'Cotton Eye Joe' probably came from the South-East of the USA. He possibly may have, more specifically, come from and gone to Tennessee. Or maybe Tennessee is just a good place to rhyme the line 'don't you see' with? He might have had untreated eye conditions like cataracts that made his eyes appear whiter than usual (white being the colour of cotton, and eye conditions that are now reversible being endemic in poor rural areas). Or maybe he just had the kind of pale eyes that the ladies get lost in. He may have been someone who sold potions in a travelling show, or - I know it's not much - but given the times and the probably African-American identity of the guy, it's also very possible he was a slave. The Bob Wills version mentions how 'Daddy worked a man called Cotton-Eyed Joe'. The Thomas Talley book relates myths that Cotton-Eyed Joe was a famous slave musician who had to bury his own son, but I don't see any corroborating evidence for that.But all of this, of course, is if the origin of the song was based on a real life person - and of course, Everett's article points out that there's no one author of the tune here (whose intentions we have access to, anyway). By the time you get to Dorothy Scarborough or Bob Wills, if there was an original meaning to the song, it was long lost. Perhaps the original Cotton-Eyed Joe doesn't matter so much as the idea of Cotton-Eyed Joe.", "label": 0}, {"content": "Cotton Eye Joe is a fictional character from the American comic book series \"The Adventures of Superman\".

What happened in 1968 is that a \"boring\" traditionnal society was questionned by the students born during the baby-boom. That generation didn't know the war and wanted a more free society (think about Woodstock in 1969).The socialist ideas have always been strong in France so this willing of a more free society was accompanied with some left-wing revendications. A lot of left-wing militants tried to take advantage of this, but they were mostly split : the actual \"socialist\" (the French Communist Party, that was defending the USSR) tried to use the students rebellion for their purpose but a lot of students, even if they had a left-wing sentiment, were not really USSR lovers (Daniel Cohn-Bendit, a leading figure of the riot, was hated by the communist and vice-versa). The Communist Party achieved to made workers to participate at the rebellion in the end and that's why the Grenelle agreements, which grant a lot of new rights to the workers, have been signed at the end of the riot : _URL_0_. But these actual revendications were far from achieving a \"socialist revolution\". France was doing good in an economical point of view (almost everyone had a work, after the WW2 a lot of agreements granted a lot of rights to the workers etc.).Overall, the sentiment that leaded to this big riot was more a willing of change from the young parisian people, tired of this \"General de Gaulle\" which represented the \"old-school\" France. I would say to answer directly to your question that France was far from a socialist revolution around 1968. In June 1968, the legislative elections was won by the political party supporting de Gaulle, and in 1969, Georges Pompidou, who you could consider as the sucessor of de Gaulle (although Pompidou is more controversial and sometime described as an politician opportunist) was elected.Workers had what they want with the Grenelle Agreements and young people, without giving up their will of a \"general dream\" (which is a pun from the \"general strike\" watchword because in french we say \"Gr\u00e8ve G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\" and \"R\u00eave G\u00e9n\u00e9ral\"), went back to the university slowly but surely...", "label": 0}, {"content": "The French Revolution of 1789 was a revolution that overthrew the monarchy and established a republic.

Rather it emerged naturally. George R. Stewart wrote about this in *Names on the Land*: > Who first may have happened to say United States of America can never be known. A hundred people may have done so independently, because the elements of the name were all in common use. Fittingly, however, the first recorded use was from the pen of Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence: \"WE, THEREFORE, The Representatives of the United States of America\u2026\"(although as eighthgear points out, Jefferson did not capitalize \"united\")Stewart says the name's origins can be traced back to before the Revolutionary War. At first, he says, people simply spoke of the \"united colonies\". This soon became the United Colonies of America or the United Colonies of North America. When war broke out commissions in the new army were at first given with one of these names. However, the problematic nature of the word \"colonies\" during a war for independence quickly became clear, and \"states\" was a natural and obvious alternative.However, no name was officially declared and there were variations. The treaty of alliance with France used the name United States of North America, but this longer form never gained popularity. The abbreviation U.S.A. was used from very early in the war, as was the short form \"United States\".At first this was an excellent name, but its flaws soon became apparent. Stewart again: > At the time [late 1770s] and for the immediate ends, the name United States of America was excellent. It represented the least possible break with tradition, and thus did not unduly frighten the conservative. It raised no question about subordinating the individual states. It was even an argument of the legitimacy of the Revolution... > As soon, however, as the emergency of the war had grown less, the inadequacy of the name became apparent. United States of America was greatly lacking in that it supplied no good adjective or term for the inhabitants of the country. It was unwieldy, inexact, and unoriginal. Although it rolled well from the tongue of an orator, not even the sincerest patriot could manage it in a poem or song.As far as alternative names, Columbia was \"the chief rival\". As for why: > Columbus had never risen as a hero during the colonial period. Great Britain had always, for political reasons, emphasized the Cabots' discovery of North America. By the time of the Revolution, however, there was no chance that Spain would extend a claim of sovereignty over New York or Philadelphia, and the Cabots were shadowy agents of a British king, unheroic in stature. The new nation began to look back toward Columbus as a kind of founding hero.Stewart goes on to argue how much better Columbia would have been: > Columbia was a happy coinage. Virginia and Georgia had already made such names familiar. It was almost everything that the United States of America was not\u2014short, precise, original, poetic, indivisible, and flexibly yielding good adjectives and nouns...And how the ideal time to make a change was at the Constitutional Convention of 1787, but that during the convention: > There seems also to be some kind of unimaginative quality in statesmen which makes them think that a name should describe, even at the expense of being awkward. Of the two chief men who might have argued for a better name, Franklin (that old maker of proverbs) was no longer vigorous, and Jefferson was in France...Even after 1787 there was \"some agitation for Columbia\", and other names such as Fredonia, proposed by Samuel Latham Mitchill shortly after 1800. After 1819 Columbia, or Colombia, became associated with the new country in South America and thus: \"was no longer available as a national name\".Around that time Washington Irving suggested Appalachia or Alleghania. Later, another proposal was to use the first letters of United States of North America to make the name \"Usona\".None of these alternatives ever gained enough traction to actually be seriously debated in Congress. Stewart makes his own opinion quite clear: > The makeshift establishment of the national name was the worst misfortune in our whole naming-history. Its too great length has consumed paper, ink, time, and energy. Its vagueness and inaccuracy have caused incalculable misunderstanding, and bad feeling.

First, let's mention that the definition of \"fiscal conservative\" has really changed in the United States during the 60 years since Eisenhower was president. During his tenure, Eisenhower was considered a moderate Republican because, [as the Miller Center puts it](_URL_1_):  > \"Eisenhower criticized the statist or big government programs of Truman's Fair Deal, yet he did not share the extreme views of some Republican conservatives. These 'Old Guard' Republicans talked about eliminating not just Fair Deal but also New Deal programs and rolling back government regulation of the economy. Eisenhower favored a more moderate course, one that he called Modern Republicanism, which preserved individual freedom and the market economy yet insured that government would provide necessary assistance to workers who had lost their jobs or to the ill or aged, who through no fault of their own, could not provide for themselves.\"In contemporary conversation, the popular notion of a fiscal conservative is someone quite a bit more reactionary than Eisenhower was, more in line with Taft, the man Eisenhower defeated for the 1952 Republican nomination. Eisenhower had a particular fetish for balanced budgets, but he didn't categorically deny increases in spending or systematically dismantle programs for their cost. He resisted increases in domestic spending and sought efficiencies/reductions, but he was willing to approve new programs and expand others. He created the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, for example, and supported federal backing for low-income housing. He also signed legislation expanding Social Security benefits. To compensate, he resisted calls to lower taxes, preferring to keep the federal budget in the black. He preferred pay-as-you-go programs; the expansion in Social Security was paid for with an increase in the payroll tax.Tremendously aiding Eisenhower's effort was one of the biggest economic booms in American history. With European and Asian economies still recovering from World War II, and the United States having rebounded from a brief postwar recession, Eisenhower inherited an economic situation that was roaring on all cylinders. While the federal budget grew during Eisenhower's tenure, it did so at a *much* slower pace than the economy as a whole. As a result, the federal budget fell from 20.4 percent of the Gross Domestic Product at the start of his eight-year term to 18.4 percent at the end of his tenure.Also consider that regardless of what *Eisenhower* believed, Congress was (and remains) the appropriating body under the U.S. Constitution. Eisenhower had a Republican Congress to aid him when he started his Presidential term, but Democrats took control of Congress during his tenure and held majorities through his second term.Now, let's turn to the second part of your question, that of the Interstate Highway System.Eisenhower led one of the U.S. Army's earliest transcontinental road voyages, which took place in 1919 and was a remarkably difficult experience. In his memoirs and other written material, Eisenhower repeatedly reflects on the difficulty of that journey, which took months. Partially as a result of that experience, Eisenhower was a particular devotee of an improved American road system. While he initially favored a system of two-lane paved highways, his experience in Germany gave him an appreciation for multi-lane, grade-separated superhighways.As the Federal Highway Administration's [own history states](_URL_0_), there was plenty of support in Congress for a national interstate highway system, but the perennial issue was how to pay for the program and what it should look like. A 1954 speech by Vice President Richard Nixon (Eisenhower's sister had died, preventing him from giving the speech) to an assembly of state governors largely broke the legislative logjam and gave the idea presidential backing.Given Eisenhower's desire for balanced budgets, he initially believed that a network of toll highways was the appropriate way to go about the program. Instead, he was swayed to the idea that bonds \u2500 funded by gasoline taxes \u2500 would be the best way to get shovels moving. Thus, just as he did with expanded Social Security benefits, Eisenhower was willing to pay for a program that cost more \u2500 if Congress agreed to find a way to pay for it.In short, it's important to note that the notion of \"fiscal conservatism\" has changed markedly in the past 60 years. Eisenhower was willing to authorize new programs and spending \u2500 but only if taxes could be found to pay for them. Thirty years after he left office, George Bush attempted to do the same thing, but with much less success. After going back on his pledge, \"Read my lips: No new taxes,\" Bush was defeated in his bid for re-election, allowing Bill Clinton to win the presidency.I'll add that *Eisenhower Versus 'The Spenders': The Eisenhower Administration, the Democrats and the Budget, 1953-6* by Iwan Morgan is a deep dive into this topic, and John Sloan's *Eisenhower and the Management of Prosperity* is another work to consider.", "label": 0}, {"content": "Dwight Eisenhower was a president who was a fiscal conservative but he also established numerous new federal taxes and embarked on the most ambitious infrastructure project in the nation's history.

A specific example is the French ship \"Pomone\" which was captured by the British Navy and promptly copied with the \"HMS Endymion\" in 1794. Such copying of the enemies designs was a deemed a necessity in order to maintain technological equality during the war. \"James' Naval History\" which is a collection of contemporary accounts of British naval battles from the Napoleonic period, repeatedly notes that strange sails were sighted and only upon bearing down upon the unknown ship were they able to determine its status as friend or foe. This would imply that the similarities between the sail designs were, for practical purposes, indiscernible when \"hull down\" i.e. only the sails are visible above the horizon. Even at closer ranges identification could range from difficult to impossible. While there is record of experienced sailors being able to notice differences in hull design between French and British warships these differences are not usually enough for proof positive identification. The British navy enacted a system of flag signals which required specific signal responses, in order to aid in identification. These signals rotated regularly to ensure that secrecy was maintained incase the signal books fell into the wrong hands, along with strict guidelines to ensure that the lead covered signal book was discarded if the ship was in danger of being captured. While accepted conventions of warfare prohibited the firing upon an enemy with out flying the national colors it was not unheard of for fake colors to be presented for the purposes of fooling the enemy for a time.As another example of the apparent similarity of British, French, and Spanish ship design, \"James' Naval History\" reports an incident (I lost my place in the book so I don't have the ship names presently, will update), in which the British Naval ship bears down on an unknown ship which when hull up still refuses to answer signals or throw out colors, this prompts the captain to close within gun range and fire a shot over the bow of the fleeing ship, thus beginning the battle. It was noted even when within gun range the British could not determine the nationality until the enemy ship flew her French colors at the commencement of the battle.In closing, while there is record of ships being identified by unique rig and design in the early 1700's by the Napoleonic Wars the science (or perhaps more precisely the art) of ship making had refined to the point of convergence in ship design and rigging, a claim further supported by the apparent difficulty in identifying uncooperative ships. I hope this answers your question with enough specificity, if you have any questions feel free to ask and I will help with what I can.Edit: I took the question to mean literally \"Ship rigged\" naval vessels. When examining smaller vessels used for scouting, patrol, and courier work there were absolutely different rigs and vessel designs because many of these smaller coastal oriented vessels were based on the regional fishing and trading vessels of the time. Thus British Cutters tended to wear a single mast with a large gaff rigged sail extended to the rear of a fore and aft rig with topsails, while many Spanish vessels in the Mediterranean used a Xebec rig with multiple masts and large \"Lateen Rigged\" sails.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The French and Spanish sail cuts were very different from the British sail cuts.

The First Officer also ordered the rudder hard to starboard, followed by ordering the propellers full astern. These commands don't typically work well together in shiphandling. Rudders require clean water washing over them to work well.

In 1920s, American companies saw Germany as a plum market by virtue of its large population and high degree of industrialization. This led to large-scale investment in German industries and subsidiaries opened up. Opel, for example, was established with the help of GM as a parent company in 1928. These international relationships continued after the advent of Hitler in 1933, but were often freighted with new political meaning. Hitler's drive for rearmament caused some alarm among German industrial circles. Although support for the Weimar Republic was very shallow among these types, they were seldom fans of the new order. Many German industrialists resented state interference in the running of the factory floor and while more than a few welcomed the Third Reich's anti-labor laws, they also became packaged together with NSDAP organs like the *Deutsche Arbeitsfront* which was a sinecure for NSDAP cronies. On the extreme end of opposition, Hugo Junkers, head of one of the most prominent aviation companies of the interwar period and a firm believer in the peaceful use of airpower, was put under house arrest and the state forced him to surrender his patents and shares in the Junkers firm. Most German industrial leaders sought a cooperative relationship with the Nazi state, but the example of Junkers was a chilling one for those that thought of resistance. It made a degree of business sense for managers to patronize the new order rather than resist it. Wilhelm von Opel, the chairman of Opel, spent lavish amounts on gifts to NSDAP elites and became the chief sponsor of the National Socialist Motor League. American-owned companies or their subsidiaries often had to deal with this new reality, but it was still an incredibly complex picture. The Third Reich encouraged the cartelization of the German economy, which already was one of the most centralized in Europe prior to 1933, and American multinationals had to operate in this environment. Opel, for example, had to comply with the 1936 Schell Program, which streamlined German automobile production making it more suitable for military use, but Ford's Cologne plant was exempt from these restrictions. Ford-Werke's managers managed to capitalize on their connections within the state to guarantee its position and provide soft commitments towards increasing production and standardization. There was considerable correspondence between Ford's leadership in the US and the Ford-Werke in Dearborn; the German managers of the subsidiary appraised their nominal US superiors of the desirability of securing state contracts and Dearborn eventually backed the sacking of Ford-Werke's general manager Erich Diestel because his Jewish background could threaten the Ford-Werke's claim to be an Aryanized German company. In contrast to Ford, IBM lost day-to-day control of its German Dehomag, but the New York company also  wanted to keep control of its near monopoly on tabulating machines, so it kept Dehomag  in operation to preserve the company's monopoly in Germany. IBM's case was paralleled in other major foreign-owned firms in Germany by the dawn of the war. While there were on paper owned by foreign concerns, they had been pretty much *de facto* German companies by 1939. The management had been Germanized and Jews thrown out of positions of authority. The laws of the Reich prevented profits from cycling out of the country, creating a headache for accountants. Reports on day to day operations grew more distant and only more so after the war broke out. But this did not mean that the German managers of these subsidiaries saw themselves as fully-independent from their parent companies. Many foreign firms were complicit in the larger process of Germanization, with more than a few gambling that playing with the state would lead to a more normalized business relationship when the political atmosphere was more relaxed. Other responses were predicated on the fear that if they resisted, then the Third Reich would engage in outright expropriation and control. This was what lay behind the convoluted case of tetraethyl lead gasoline. This was an old technology from the 1920s whose American-owned patents and manufacturing data were relatively open. Italy had already in 1935 overrode these patents on its own accord and allowed a state-owned company to produce it. There was alarm in American circles (the US patent was owned by the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation which in turn was under joint control of GM and Standard Oil) that Germany would follow the Italian precedent and seize control of the process and its production. Thus the Americans were more receptive to IG Farben's offer to form Ethyl GmbH with IG Farben, the German Standard Oil subsidiary, and Opel sharing ownership. The protection of a large German patron like IG Farben would allow the US firms to keep their trade secrets under some form of control, but the subsidiaries soon became passive partners as IG Farben assumed more control over Ethyl GmbH. Fears of losing control were also quite acute in the financial sector, both German and non-German owned, as they often operated under implicit threat that National Socialism saw such unproductive wealth as suspect and tainted by Judaism, which in turn made financial institutions more conducive towards freezing Jewish assets or other fiscal measures pushed by the state.  There was very little in terms of principled or ethics-based opposition among large businesses within the Third Reich. The example of Hugo Junkers may have been a warning shot to other industrial chiefs, but it was also an outlier in terms of behavior by industrial chiefs. Frictions with the dictatorship often had more to do with allocations of raw materials and quotas rather than Aryanization or the later use of slave labor. Nor was the Nazi dictatorship simply a case of firms cowering for fear of their very existence. In the case of Opel, the German managers often parlayed the regime's rhetoric of autarky and confiscation of non-German property to GM in the hopes that the parent company would sanction its seeking funding for more raw materials. A number of companies bucked state directives ordering them to focus on armaments-related projects; IG Farben for example did not invest too heavily in synthetic fiber production because it felt it was not viable for the long-term health of the country even though synthetic fibers would be valuable for a war effort should Germany find itself blockaded. Other firms were able to hoard liquid assets for postwar expansion even though this was contrary to the needs of the war economy. The regime could of course use strong-arm tactics to get its way, but there always was room for maneuver within the Third Reich. The polycratic nature of the state meant that business leaders could find a powerful patron to block initiatives by other corners of the chaotically-organized state. Patronage sometimes failed, but it was one of the mechanisms companies used to survive and even profit from the Third Reich. The idea that the Nazis were \"thugs for the rich\" is a charge that actually dates back to the 1930s and was a staple of both socialist and communist propaganda of this time and in the later case remained an orthodoxy through the Cold War. It has also been taken as a given by various anti-capitalist movements seeking to tar existing multinational concerns like Ford with the taint of the Third Reich. Such contentions generate more heat than light. Hitler may have held Henry Ford and Fordism in high esteem, but so to did many other world leaders at this time, including the USSR of Stalin which practically enshrined Fordist/Taylorist industrial management as state doctrine.  The reality was of course far more complicated and part of the problem of examining American multinationals and the Third Reich was that of the latter's twelve-year existence, Germany was at peace with the US for eight of these years. American firms, like their German counterparts, found themselves having to adjust to a state predicated both on military expansion and a subordination of industry to the needs of the state. Most industrial leaders accommodated these demands, and more than a few profited from them, but many were uneasy with them. Even in giant German conglomerates like Krupp or Rheinmetall-Borsig which grew tremendously under state military contracts, their management found that they were no longer quite masters of their own house. But very much like American multinationals, German industrialists tended to find they could operate under the Third Reich. The state may have leveled varying controls over exports, raw materials, and profits, but many businesses in Germany, both German- and foreign-owned, felt confident enough to work within this system. Many larger industrial firms tacked to a long-range vision in which compliance with the state's immediate demands were an acceptable risk if it meant preserving their investments for when things had settled down in Germany. Internal documentation from companies like Degussa AG or Ford's various European subsidiaries were less concerned with the morality or ethics of using slave labor then they were with preserving trade secrets or future economic viability. Other business leaders were also in a degree of ideological resonance with *some* aspects of the dictatorship.

The problem is that \"surnames\" did not become a thing until a couple of hundred years after the Norman Conquest. They caught on with the aristocratic families first as they became known by \"surnames\" connected to towns they owned back in Normandy. For example, the Percy family took their name from the town of Percy-en-Auge. It was different for the lower orders, however, as surnames were not adopted round the time of the Norman Conquest but over the next couple of hundred years as they were needed to identify people for taxation purposes. Consequently, people did not take their surnames from their lords but from things that would identify them in a small town setting that would differentiate you from other people who had the same first name as you. These are sometimes called \"eke-names\". For example, John Short might have been so named because he was short, while John Bytheway might have been called that because he lived next to the main road and John Moxon would have got his name because he was the son of a formidable woman named Margaret (Moxon being a contraction of \"Meg's son\"). If John Short, John Bytheway, and John Moxon all lived in Leicester and a new John arrived in town saying he was from Derby, pretty soon he would be known as John Derby. When John Short, John Bytheway, John Moxon, and John Derby died and passed their farms and small tenements onto their sons, William Short, James Bytheway, Robert Moxon, and Henry Derby would use their father's \"eke-names\" as surnames to establish their connection to their father's property. The poorer you were, the less property you had, the less need for a surname.So, what influence did the Normans have on surname practices? My own surname is actually an interesting example in this case. \"Emery\" derives from the Germanic first name Emaurri or Amaury, which was a popular first name for conquering Normans. You would think that would imply I am descended from a Norman. However, that's not necessarily true. Cecily Clarke has argued that Anglo-Saxons utilised Norman names for their sons as a way of integrating themselves with their new overlords in an attempt to climb the social ladder, while giving their daughters Anglo-Saxon names to preserve family memory. Around 1066, it is clear to see that all the Anglo-Saxon men had names like \u00c6thelwulf, Cynewulf, and \u00c6thelred. However, by 1100, England is full of Roberts, Richards, and Williams. Not all of these were of Norman descent. While some were of mixed Anglo-Saxon and Norman descent (the chronicler Orderic Vitalis is a good example of this), others were fully Anglo-Saxon. It just seems that many \u00c6thelwulfs had decided to name their sons Robert to allow them to climb the ranks more easily. This trend meant that by the fifteenth century, England was full of Williams, Matildas, Alices, and Roberts. The only Anglo-Saxon name that \"makes it\" through the medieval era is Edward, and that is only because the Anglo-Norman king Henry III (1207-1272) decided to name his eldest son after the Anglo-Saxon saint Edward the Confessor. The other Anglo-Saxon names that are perhaps more familiar to us as first names (eg. Edwin, Edith, Alfred) were almost entirely resurrected by the Victorians.So, let's see how the acquiring of a \"Norman\" surname by an Anglo-Saxon plays out. Let's say my hundred times great-grandfather was an Anglo-Saxon peasant called \u00c6thelred with a wife named Beorhtgifu. England is invaded and their local patch of land is taken over by a guy named Amaury, who quickly constructs the local castle. Wanting to be on Lord Amaury's good side, \u00c6thelred and Beorhtgifu decide to name their son Amaury after their new lord. Amaury grows up on Lord Amaury's estate, and due to interactions with the Normans soldiers brought over by Lord Amaury, Amaury picks up a bit of Anglo-Norman. Through this, he gets a job at Lord Amaury's castle. Lord Amaury dies, and his castle is inherited by his son Lord John. Lord John gets married to the daughter of a local Norman lord, Alice, who has employed an Anglo-Saxon servant called \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d. Amaury and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d fall in love, get married, and have two children, who they name John and Alice after their bosses. Lord John and Lady Alice are happy for their servants, and award them a small tract of land just outside of Leicester.Amaury and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d move to the farm with their children. When the taxman comes round, Amaury puts his name down as \"Amaury de Leicester\", as he is the only Amaury in the area. When Amaury dies, his farm is inherited by his son John. When the taxman comes round again, John has to distinguish himself from the other Johns who could also go by the name \"John de Leicester\" - John Short, John Bytheway, John Moxon, and John Derby - so decides to take his father's name and becomes John Amaury. John Amaury gets married to John Bytheway's sister Alice, who is of full Anglo-Saxon heritage but was also named after Lady Alice. As John and Alice Amaury have not lived at the castle for a long time, they don't speak Anglo-Norman to their sons William (who they named because they liked the name) and Amaury (who is named after John's father), and so the two boys don't learn the language. When John Amaury dies, his eldest son William inherits the family farm. As William can't speak Anglo-Norman, the name \"Amaury\" is tricky to pronounce, so he just becomes known as William Emery. His brother Amaury goes to work in town in Derby, but finds another Amaury from Leicester already living there. To distinguish himself from the other Amaury when the taxman comes round, Amaury decides to take a surname. He decides against Emery, because \"Amaury Emery\" is the silliest thing he's ever heard, but he thinks that \"Amaury Johnson\" after his father sounds good. Therefore, even though William Emery and Amaury Johnson are brothers, they have different surnames. William Emery's descendants will believe they are of Norman ancestry because of the Norman sounding \"Emery\", while Amaury's descendants will think they are Anglo-Saxon because  of the Germanic suffix \"-son\". In fact, both William and Amaury are patrilineally descended from an Anglo-Saxon great-grandfather named \u00c6thelwulf who was just trying to help his son climb the social ladder by giving him a Norman name.Interestingly, a [2013 study](_URL_0_) showed that (in the UK) if you were in possession of a \"Norman\" surname (such as the heavy-hitters like Darcy, Percy, Mandeville, or Montgomery) you are more likely to be higher up the socio-economic scale with a greater chance of having attended Oxbridge in comparison to people with \"Anglo-Saxon\" surnames. These \"Norman\" surnames highlighted were often aristocratic ones connected to towns in Normandy (like Percy) and not ambiguous ones like Emery. It perhaps shows that there *is* something in a \"Norman\" surname indicating you are of Norman descent (as a father could pass his wealth and privilege onto his son), but at the same time, some names that appear Norman might not indicate your ancestry at all.**Short Bibliography*** Cecily Clark, 'Women's Names in Post-Conquest England: Observations and Speculations', *Speculum* 53/2 (1978), 223-251.* Gregory Clark and Neil Cummins, 'Surnames and Social Mobility: England 1230-2012', *Economic History Working Papers* 181 (2013), 1-26.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Normans were a Germanic people who settled in England and Ireland in the 11th century.

They were simply mortals who had achieved something remarkable in life, and deserved lasting recognition in death. Like any Greek hero, Hercules pushed the bounds of human possibility, and was in that sense admirable. He was remembered, moreover, as (what we would call) a \"culture hero\" - someone who prepared the way for civilization by destroying monsters. Even myths that presented him in a positive light, however, never ignored the collateral damage Hercules tended to inflict on the communities he helped. He was usually described as more or less well-meaning, if a bit dim; but even when Hera wasn't driving him to atrocities like the murder of his children, he had a murderous temper that often led him to destroy some or all of those he had set out to help. Unlike, say, Theseus, he was very much a \"stab first and ask questions later\" sort of hero. But the Greeks admired his deeds, not his character. And since, uniquely among Greek heroes, Hercules became a god upon his death/apotheosis, he was revered as a patron of mortals, especially those with a special interest in health and physical strength. Shrines of Hercules could be found in every Gymnasium, and athletes sought his blessings before competitions. Hercules is a strikingly protean figure in Greek literature. Sometimes - as in Euripides' *Alcestis* \\- he appears more or less as he does in the myths: immensely strong, crude in manner, and none too bright. But as early as the fifth century BCE, he began to also be presented as a proto-philosopher - probably because (as a mortal who became divine) he was a natural metaphor for the perfectibility of mankind. This is the origin of the famous \"Choice of Hercules\" myth, first outlined by the sophist Prodicus: a young Hercules encounters two women - Vice and Virtue (or in other versions, Good Order and Tyranny); Vice offers him riches and fame, Virtue promises hardships in the service of the good - and Hercules wisely chooses the path of Virtue. In the end, as a mortal who became a god, Hercules was simply a familiar figure who could ethicized as needed to fit a given author's purposes.

To quote regarding one notable incident outside Leningrad, (from Beevor): > Altogether over 135,000 Leningraders, factory workers as well as professors, had volunteered, or been forced to volunteer. They had no training, no medical assistance, no uniforms, no transport and no supply system.

A similar defense was mounted at Stalingrad, where the workers of the Barrikady Ordnance Factory, the Red October Steel Works and the Dzerzhinsky Tractor Factory executed a desperate delaying action on August 25th. In that case, Stalingrad was practically undefended, and the Soviets needed to do *anything* they could to slow down the German advance, and gain time to bring more proper troops up.

The child does not want for nurses: all wish to have it, and the mother is no longer its mistress. In fact, this class of females are much more anxious to nurse their children than unmarried girls who become mothers, but are not prostitutes, and even than many others who move in respectable society. ....They despise and renounce those who take no care of their children, and attach a certain degree of glory and pride to the accomplishment of their maternal duties.* [pg. 70](_URL_0_)He goes on to say that many of these children die--which was not all that unusual for all children at this time. However, \"as to their education, some mothers are careful of their actions in presence of their children, bring them up well, and do all they can to rescue them from their own condition, and even keep them ignorant of it. I am happy to say that most of those who bring up their children, act in this manner.\" Parent-Duch\u00e2telet also noted that \"prostitutes are much more apt to conceive than is generally admitted: in order to this it requres the concurrence of the will and the laisser-aller [lack of restraint] of the girl, an intellectual and moral state, foreign to the habitual exercise of her vocation. And if these girls then miscarry, it is either from criminal measures [abortion], or from the exercise of their vocation.Some prostitutes are singularly prolific, having 7, 8, and even 10 children: but when this occurs, they are generally married or attached to one man; in these cases, their labors are fortunate, and their children are as lively as other children.\" (pg. 94)Mortality, though, was dangerously high.

Henry has already spent his youth aboard merchant ships, and decides to enlist with the Royal Navy as a junior officer where he sees real action for the first time. Most people have a romanticized idea of what a naval battle looked like (*Pirates of the Caribbean*), but the reality is that a direct hit by a round of grapeshot doesn't leave a pretty picture. After a battle, the deck of a ship would be coated in a layer of blood and the body parts of dead shipmates. Those wounded in battle were still expected to fulfill their duties aboard the ship, and rarely were compensated for their often crippling injuries.Outside of battle, it was common practice to be beaten and humiliated for minor infractions, as well as to be fed poor and rotten food. Clean water was such an issue on long voyages that sailors were issued a pint of rum each day - a substance they could be sure wouldn't spoil. The sailors would then return home empty handed, as the navy simply wouldn't pay their salaries for years at a time.In 1693, finally fed up with the navy, Avery hears about a few wealthy businessmen looking for sailors willing to voyage out to the Caribbean, where they will then trade with the Spanish and plunder French ships and plantations. Merchant ships more reliably paid salary and fed their sailors, and hearing that one month' pay would be advanced, Avery quickly applied for the position. He was hired as first mate aboard the *Charles II*, a 46-gun flagship. Every sailor was promised they would receive their salary every six months.Fast forward, they depart for Spain to collect the necessary papers. What should have taken two weeks bizarrely takes the *Charles II* five months. They reach Spain and find their privateering papers have yet to arrive. So they sit around for another month. Finding that their salary hasn't been paid at the semiannual interval, they send a petition the businessman running the show, who then orders many of the petitioners be slapped in chains and thrown in the brig. Already disgruntled, the sailors soon discover that they've been sold to the Spanish crown.May 6, 1694, Avery then gathers as many men as he can and mutinies. They steal the *Charles II* and rename it the *Fancy*. A democratic decisions amongst everyone on board, they sail for the Indian Ocean with the intent of piracy. Everyone was to receive equal share of their plunder, except for their newly elected Captain Avery, who would only receive 2x everyone else's share. For comparison, a captain typically received anywhere from 6x to 14x.June 1695, thirteen months after their mutiny, they've already captured nine ships and have made it to Madagascar. They hear about a massive fleet leaving the port of Mocha, and that treasure ships owned by the Grand Moghul of India would be sailing. Hooking up with other pirates in the area, they assault one ship and make off with \u00a350,000+. Deciding that wasn't enough, they boldly assault the 80-gun *Ganj-i-sawai*, only coming out victorious through an utter fluke. They pillage the ship, raping the woman and plundering what they can. This time, they make off with \u00a3150,000 worth of treasure. They then sail for the Caribbean in order to escape retribution. The *Fancy* shows up in Nassau on April 1st, 1696, where the crew divvies up the treasure, and everyone splits in their own direction. Two years after their mutiny, each pirate makes off with about \u00a31,000, roughly 20 years worth of pay.This is a paraphrasing of the first 25 pages of Colin Woodward's *The Republic of Pirates*.

I'll talk about three levels, and hopefully other redditors can jump in as well: (1) How widely did the 16C recognize the idea of a \"better\" world (2) Differences in 15C versus 16C life for \"commoners\" (3) What kinds of information would 16C \"commoners\" have had about the recent past. I put the word in quotes because I'm not sure quite what meaning that holds. This answer will use Germany/the Holy Roman Empire (HRE) as a proxy for \"central Europe\" and discuss primarily the rural peasantry.Medieval Latin Europeans dwelled in a \"world grown old,\" a world decaying towards the arrival of Antichrist and Armageddon. When 12C \"renaissance\" scholar John of Salisbury cited Bernard of Chartres as saying \"If I have seen so far, it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants,\" the point was that the age of the giants was over. While this is the elite of the elite, the apocalyptic climate in the 15th century ramping up to the Reformation was even more intense. A point that often gets lost in modern conception of \"reform\" as improvement for the future is that the Reformers acted out of a zealous belief that they faced an *imminent* Judgment Day. They worked to save souls in a world that would only get worse.But a shift occurs over the 16C. In postils--collections of sermons--the interpretation of natural disasters like plague and flood shifts away from APOCALYPSE SOON! Preachers continue to stress the need for repentance and prayer (now along proper Lutheran/Calvinist/Catholic lines), but they stress that prophecies of, for example, disastrous popes have *been fulfilled*, not loom as Antichrist in the near future. 16C sermons offer comfort and consolation in a more heightened, systematic, and, I say as a medievalist, successful manner than 15C ones. Postils, as David Frymire points out, are a key source for triangulating (if not recording) \"popular\" views. These books were widely printed and owned by even rural parish priests, and disparaging remarks by the Postille authors tell us that the sermons were preached verbatim at least sometimes (rather than being guides). The goal of providing *consolation* and appealing to the audience was baked into the sermons, and indeed, sermons were massively popular events in the 16C. People clearly responded on an emotional level to the messages they heard, which suggests that these texts offer at least a frosted window into a broader 16C mentality than just their writers'. You could even, I think, point to the demands of the 1524-25 Peasants' War (PW/GPW) armies as a recognition that the world could improve (or at least, could return to earlier status). Again and again, we see the call to *return* to \"God's law\" as the rightful determiner of water use rights, hunting rights, fishing rights. Peasants protested what they saw as unjust, *recent* developments. It's common to attribute the more \"optimistic\" mindset to the so-called Renaissance, whose scholars viewed themselves as illuminating the 'dark ages' with the light of classical antiquity. But this was a broader development on multiple levels of society, that happened to include the vaunted Renaissance.So if 16th century people had the basic concept that the world *could* improve, the questions follow: what was different, were the differences \"improvement\" (*cui bono*?), and who would have been aware that these things were different.The PW, indeed warfare in general, is a good introduction to the difficulties of talking about \"improvements\" in 15-16C HRE. The PW was massively destructive, to be sure. But was it the last of the great medieval anti-feudal revolts...or the first of the great anti-territorial-state-apparatus revolts? There is a certain tinge of \"meet the new boss\" in the historiography on the matter. On wars more broadly, the 16C certainly produced more name-recognition conflicts. The rise of confessional (religious) warfare did not spare the HRE, although the Peace of Augsburg helped either delay the worst until the next century or made the worst *even worse* when it finally happened. But the 15-early 16C witnessed the bloody, brutal process by which the errant \"robber knights\" and petty nobles were brought under the dominion of the territorial princes, the unofficial, constant warfare in which peasants were as always the victims.For the rural peasantry in western Germany, there were perhaps fewer developments than one might expect given the enormous cultural and martial upheavals of the early 16C. There was a general shift away from viticulture across the HRE, with cereal agriculture taking its place. Tom Scott observes that areas *suitable* for growing grapes continued to grow grapes, and suggests that this change reflects (1) the need to feed a growing population (2) better recognition of crop/soil/climate fit. One result of this change was that Germans drank less wine and more beer. So, good news for early modern Oktoberfest?One innovation was the formation of guild-type organizations for *rural* craftsmen in the orbit of German cities. But this is an ambivalent development. On one hand, it provided these artisans with a collective voice in the local economy, perhaps better access to urban markets. On the other, these were a reaction to stronger *urban* craft guilds that tried to limit rural artisanal competition. So definitely a give and take situation. As cities expanded in both size and fiscal power, city-country cooperation and competition grew increasingly important and increasingly contested. Apparently the situation sometimes grew dire enough/threatened the overall economic situation enough that territorial princes got involved where they could. (Not all HRE cities were subject to princely authority.)Another HRE-wide development was the increase in mining and mining-based towns. This is still going to represent a small fraction of society, and I'm not sure you can call it an improvement in terms of a miner peasant versus their earlier or contemporary farmer counterpart. On the other hand, as a result people would have had...saltier food? More metal implements? (Iron and tin-plating perk up tremendously in this era, especially around Nuremberg in Bavaria). The spread of the glass-making proto-industry meant better-off peasants might be able to acquire glass for their windows, too.But while the general fabric of rural society remained fairly constant in the western HRE, eastern peasants weren't quite so lucky. Eastern population growth and urbanization lagged behind the west. Eastern HRE economies oriented towards commercial agriculture serving export markets--in the western HRE, other European destinations, and even overseas. The drivers and beneficiaries of this organization-reorientation were not peasants or burgers but the landed nobility. There was a gradual erosion of earlier peasant status as *producers* with the right to hold land and determine its use. Lords exercised the control. This shift was not a new creation of the 16C, to be clear, but it was accelerating in the east even as peasant status crept upwards or held its ground in the west.But would peasants have known about these changes? If so, which ones? We saw some signs in the Peasants' War that people had the *idea* things were different in the fairly recent past, although one could posit this was simply a rhetorical stance to achieve goals like better resource access. So how might rural peasants have learned about their counterparts in the recent past? Outside the cities, literacy rates remained rock-bottom low. However, oral tradition, preaching, and the occasional reader would have been sources for recent historical knowledge. (Separate from ideas about biblical times or ancient Greece). When William Chester Jordan looked at the future legacies of various 14C disasters, he found that the Black Death stuck in people's minds in a way the Great Famine did not. We know that plague and famine reoccurred in waves after that; plague being quite fearsome but never *as* disastrous. In fact, there is some evidence to suggest that either early modern people got better at combating plague through quarantine, or perhaps the virus evolved to be less catastrophically fast-killing. So would the 1350 Black Death stick out in 16th century minds as \"that horrible time in the past\"?In fact, what we see in 16th century postils is the opposite! A *universal* view that the world after 1550 or so is a degenerating mess of plague, famine, war, catastrophe after catastrophe, permeates the sermons. This is not pastorly melancholy. 1560-1630 was another 'little ice age' across central Europe, bringing with it shorter growing seasons and weather-induced bad harvests. In combination with a population on the rebound after 1470 (and not entirely devastated by the 1524-25 Peasants' War, to which this answer will return in a bit), the result was less food for more people. If people went to bed hungry each night, it must have been tough to feel that they were living in a \"better world\" than their 1450 ancestors.Further reading:* Peter Blickle, *The Revolution of 1525: German Peasants' War from a New Perspective** Tom Scott, *Society and Economy in Germany, 1300-1600** Thomas Brady, *German Histories in the Age of Reformations* (covers especially the cultural-political angle that was only barely the background of my answer)", "label": 0}, {"content": "The invention of the printing press in the mid 1500s allowed for the first time in history to have books printed in a large number of languages.

Shihan de Silva in \"African Identity in Asia: The Cultural Effects of Forced Migration\" has charted different rituals and folk traditions, linguistic markers, and dance and musical traditions to show Siddhi influence from Yemen to the Deccan Peninsula.  Portuguese and Dutch sources in the Indian Ocean often remarked on the military and seafaring prowess of Siddhis.  Indian kings and Shahs used Africans as cavalrymen, bodyguards, generals, and soldiers, citing their lack of familial ties as a true loyal bond.Some, like Malik Ambar, ended up being powerful enough to control kings and depose one that slighted him by not wanting to marry his daughter.  The states of Sachin and Janjira actually survived Mughal invasion somewhat intact, and lasted through British colonial control, and both of those states had descendants of the Siddhis.  Note, in different source text, you may also see the word \"Habshi\" or \"Habash\" instead of Siddhi.

First, Cuba didn't so much \"go with the Soviet Union\" as go their own way, which ended up involving trade deals and decent relations with the Soviet Union. Second, what constitutes a \"rich paradise\" is very subjective.Cuba had a long history of colonialism. In Spanish hands for some 400 years, it saw the destruction (though not complete eradication) of its native population, the mass import of slaves, the creation of a sugar plantation economy, the closing of ranks of the colonial elite with Spain after the example of Haiti's Revolution, and the eventual severing of Spanish rule only for Cuba to become a virtual economic colony of the United States. With massive foreign investment and ownership of most major industries, and proscriptions for U.S. control over Cuban foreign and economic policy, pre-Revolutionary Cuba saw the growth of an economic elite and the stagnation and poverty of the average peasant. There was a somewhat democratic government, until former President Fulgencio Batista installed himself as a military dictator after an electoral defeat. His regime remained close with the United States.Hatred for the Batista regime was so great, that after the triumph of the Cuban Revolution, popular demand compelled the revolutionaries to implement a plan for the prosecution of Batista's \"torture men\" and \"war criminals,\" modeled on the Nuremberg Trials. Che Guevara's duties of overseeing the execution of those sentenced to death earned him the name \"The Butcher of La Caba\u00f1a\" among pro-Batista Cuban expats, though enjoyed over 90% approval on the island.When the Cuban Revolution came, it had a broad coalition and a vague program, enjoying nearly unanimous support by the Cuban people. Fidel Castro was a nondescript socialist with nationalist tendencies, Che Guevara was a Marxist-Leninist, and Camilo Cienfuegos was an anarchist. In 1959, after three years of fighting, the Cuban Revolution triumphed at the beginning of the year. The United States took a hostile approach to the Cuban Revolution following the May 1959 agrarian reform program, crafted by Guevara, which restricted the size of private farms in Cuba to 3,333 acres. Cuba had not yet declared its revolution socialist or Marxist-Leninist, and the U.S. ambassador stated that Fidel Castro had no interest in international communism at the time. The United States, after consulting with large U.S. landholders, launched a covert war \"to bring about the replacement of the Castro regime,\" by bombing Cuba and its sugar plantations. After the bombings, Cuba nationalized U.S. landholdings and corporations, and the U.S. responded with the famously botched Bay of Pigs invasion. After this, the 26th of July Movement (the revolutionary organization) merged with the Popular Socialist Party, eventually declaring a Marxist-Leninist program and becoming the Communist Party of Cuba.Initially, the Soviet Union was not impressed with Fidel Castro, considering him a bourgeois nationalist, and worried about what relationship he would have with the United States. However, after the hostilities with the U.S., relations warmed and a temporary sugar trade agreement was reached, which would be revised and continued for the rest of the USSR's existence. Cuba entered the Cold War with the Missile Crisis, following the failed U.S. invasion attempt, but its resolution disillusioned Castro and Guevara with the Soviet Union, which they saw as having used Cuba as a pawn. Relations continued, as did trade, but Cuba was never under the sway of the USSR like the Eastern Bloc countries. Indeed, during the Cold War, Fidel Castro spent several years as the chair of the Non-Aligned Movement.In place of the Cold War, Cuba was involved in its own struggle, against the United States, against colonial regimes, against multinational corporations, and against the Latin American right. Historian Tanya Harmer referred to this as the \"Inter-American Cold War,\" though I'd call it something like \"the Great Southern War,\" or really anything without \"Cold War\" in the name, to distance it from the geopolitical conflict between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.While the Soviet Union basically conceded Latin America as being firmly in the sphere of influence of the United States, and moved on to what it considered more fertile territory, Cuba was the main force in opposition to the U.S. in the Western Hemisphere, training and arming and supporting the revolutionary left, after Latin American leftists became largely disillusioned with parliamentary democracy following the 1973 Chilean coup d'\u00e9tat (against Cuban ally Salvador Allende), the latest in a line of U.S.-backed military coups against leftist democracies.Public views of Cuba tend to relegate it to satellite status in the Cold War. Not only was it officially non-aligned, its own international struggles outpaced the Soviet Union's in a number of ways. During the Cold War, Cuba had the second largest global military presence, behind the United States and *ahead* of the Soviet Union, despite having only around 3% of its population. As of around 2006, the tally was some 400,000 troops internationally deployed since the triumph of the 26th of July Movement. In addition to its Latin American activities, Cuba was very involved with supporting African revolutionaries, perhaps most notably in the Congo and Angola, though there was activity across the continent. Cuba also built the largest civilian (humanitarian and medical) aid program in the world, outpacing even the United Nations and the World Health Organizations, sending tens of thousands of doctors around the world. Even in recent years, Cuba has kept this up, with medical aid agreements with Venezuela (and one currently being negotiated with Brazil), and acting as a first responder to the Haitian Earthquake. Cuba was also the first country to send aid, in the form of 1,586 doctors and 26 tons of medicine, in the aftermath of Hurricane, but they were turned away by the United States government, which also rejected one million barrels of oil, two mobile hospitals, and $5 million from Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's Venezuela (which later managed to donate $2 million anyway through other channels).Ultimately, we cannot know how Cuban history would have been different had Che Guevara's influence not brought about that first land reform program. There have been a lot of successes for the Cuban people, including a universal medical care program, the highest literacy rate in the world, decent standards of living, a higher life expectancy than the United States, and at least more popular input in government than under Batista. There have been a lot of contradictions and failures, too, though, including the long period of repression of LGBT Cubans (which Fidel Castro publicly apologized and took the blame for in 2010) and a significant amount of criticisms of political repression (see [an attack on](_URL_1_) and [a defense of](_URL_0_) Cuba). Other things, like its tenacious resistance to U.S. influence and its general equality of citizens might be classed as positive or negative depending upon your views. It is important to note that many of the Cuban government's actions have been responses to the U.S. embargo, meant to strangle the Cuban people into desperation, in order to compel them to overthrow the government. The shortages in most every area caused by this embargo has necessitated a very planned economy, to stretch everything enough to provide for all citizens, and that has led to political repressions in order to preserve the system.Passing judgement on the Cuban Revolution, or thinking of it in simple terms, is not to be recommended. For lack of a better way to sum up a cursory review of the course of the system born of the 26th of July Movement, I'll end by quoting the Conclusion of Aviva Chomsky's *A History of the Cuban Revolution* (Wiley-Blackwell, 2011). > *I do not wish to sum up the Cuban revolutionary experience or cast an overarching judgement on it. The Revolution has been wildly audacious, experimental, and diverse. It has evolved under often averse circumstances. It created unprecedented socioeconomic equality, and showed the world that it is indeed possible for a poor, Third World country to feed, educate, and provide health care for its population. It fostered astonishing artistic and intellectual creativity, while also creating stifling bureaucracies and limits on freedoms that many in the United States take for granted. It also showed just how extraordinarily difficult it is to overcome economic underdevelopment.* > *The history of the Cuban Revolution is still unfolding, and the most educated predictions have proven wrong again and again. I left Cuba in August, 2008 both optimistic and pessimistic, and mostly, curious, about what would happen in the coming years.* > *One of the best things about studying the past, or a different country or culture, is how it can enable you to see things about your own reality in a different light. Usually we take our own historical context for granted. Until we are brought face to face with other possibilities, it's hard for us to even imagine that they exist. If we want to imagine a better world for all of us, I can think of no better place to start than by studying the Cuban Revolution.*^1^1 pp. 194-195", "label": 0}, {"content": "Cuba was a poor country that was unable to compete with the United States.

The British 47th Division (1/2 London), for example, used a series of playing card insignia in various colors. Chappell's 1986 *British Battle Insignia: 1914-1918* mentions this, as does his *The British Army in World War I: The Western Front 1916-18*.One of the better-known uses, however, comes from the French tank corps during the war. The French formed their tank corps from the artillery service, and the first tankers were known as Artillerie Speciale. Until September 1917, they had no official branch badge, and so they tended to invent their own. One of the most popular was a play on the initials AS \u2500 which is also the French word for *ace*. These badges would include AS and a playing card symbol representing a different battery: spade for the first, heart for the second, diamond for the third, and club for the fourth. *The French Army 1914-18* by Osprey Publishing goes into this, as does Zaloga's *French Tanks of World War I*. You can also see the French symbols on display aboard destroyed tanks [in this video](_URL_0_).American units picked up the habit as well. The 5th Infantry Division, for example, was formed in 1917 and was known as the Red Diamond, after its shoulder insignia. Soldiers took up the symbol, [decorating their equipment with playing cards featuring it](_URL_3_), a habit that would last into the next war.Playing cards were ubiquitous in the trenches; they were easily portable, durable, and could be used in a variety of games. Mass manufacturing made large numbers available, and standardization of the suits and numbers ensured that the same symbols showed up again and again. In WWII, for example, the 101st Airborne used [painted playing card symbols on the sides of helmets](_URL_1_) to distinguish soldiers belonging to different units (thanks to /u/loserlame for the link, and see Mark Bando's *101st Airborne* for exhaustive detail on equipment).Playing cards show up in decoration on personal gear, on nose art for aircraft and tanks in every war from World War I to the present day. In Vietnam, they started assuming a newer, grimmer role.James McManus' *Cowboys Full: The Story of Poker* covers the Vietnam aspect concisely and clearly in one portion of its history of poker. In April 1965, President Johnson \u2500 through National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy \u2500 ordered \"intensified and expanded psychological activities in the Vietnamese conflict.\" A 22-person psychological warfare unit arrived in the country by September that year and began a leaflet campaign. It isn't clear who came up with the idea, but in late 1965 or early 1966, soldiers came up with the idea of placing a playing card on Vietnamese dead as a way to taunt the opposition.The U.S. Air Force came up with its own technique. It sprinkled playing cards in its leaflet campaign, but when it was about to carpet bomb an area, the drop included only the ace of spades. Writing in the *Village Voice* at the time, Ian Urbina reported: \"Before long, the Pavlovian technique took hold, and just the dropping of aces was sufficient to clear an entire area.\"In early 1966, soldiers wrote the U.S. Playing Card Company, asking for decks containing nothing but the ace of spades. The company responded and used the event to its advantage, promoting it in a PR campaign. The company soon received thousands of requests from the families of servicemen interested in sending similar decks to their sons. The reports showed up in *Life*, *Look*, *Newsweek*, and the *Huntley-Brinkley Report*, to name just a few.The ace of spades was commonly believed to be the \"death card\" and had a psychological impact on the Vietnamese. Whether that's true [isn't exactly clear](_URL_2_), but it showed up on American propaganda leaflets throughout the war anyway. Even if it wasn't an effective *negative* psychological warfare tool, it was strongly *positive* for the Americans who saw it. As James Ebert's *A Life in A Year: The American Infantryman in Vietnam* explains, the card, tucked into a helmet band (it secured the cloth helmet cover to the helmet), became a form of sanctioned expression. Because the card was part of a psychological warfare campaign, it wasn't necessarily out of regulation to have one on your helmet. Some soldiers took the card even farther, writing messages on it.As Ebert writes, \"Men penciled in 'God is my pointman' or expressed the wish that President Johnson himself was serving in that capacity.\"The idea of the card was so ingrained into the psyche of the U.S. military that the symbols reappeared in Gulf War I leaflets dropped on Iraqi soldiers and still appear from time to time on Americans' gear today.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The cards are a symbol of the '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' ''", "label": 1}, {"content": "In terms of how much respect Japan got in the eyes of the world powers, the war acted as a major shift in how westerners saw Japan. For Great Britain, it verified that Japan was a strong ally, able to help protect British interests in the Pacific, while France saw Japan as further complicating their own imperial ambitions in Asia. The most drastic shift, however, is how the U.S. saw Japan, since the victory over the Russians demonstrated that Japan could now be considered a threat to America's new colonies in the Philippines and Hawaii. Before the war, American's thought of Japan as a puppet nation that would support American trade in Asia. After the war proved that Japan could beat a technological great power one-on-one, the U.S. feared that Japan could no longer be easily controlled, and their relations chilled from a partnership to a rival relationship. On top of this, Japan's victory over the Russians threw into question notions on white supremacy in the imperialist context. Japan proved that technological and military supremacy were not necessarily linked with race. This caused a crisis in the west, since imperialist motivations were based on the idea that non-whites couldn't run a modern country. This caused groups that had previously supported Japanese modernity in the late 19th century to now viewed the Japanese with suspicion after the Russo-Japanese war. The war represents a turning point, where Japan was given a lot more respect by the west but also became far more feared, leading to a chilled relationship between the west and Japan.

Let's look at the castle of Lussan in Gard, in the South of France, near Uzes.The town of Lussan has 480 inhabitants today.  Probably about the same number back in Medieval times.  It is a slightly larger village than the average village in the Uzege, but not as large as the larger towns.Every one of these little villages (circa 30 villages within the same radius (20km) from Uzes as Lussan) has a castle, mostly built in the 12th century.  (The castle of Lussan was first built in the 12th century, though it was modified over the years, and its current appearance is more or less as it was in the 15th century.)Here are some pictures of Lussan, a satellite view, with the position of the castle marked.  Two pictures of the castle, and a picture of the walled hilltop town of Lussan (the castle guards the entry of the road up into the town)._URL_0_If you look at these pictures, you can see that the castle footprint and height indicate that the castle is about the size of 8 of Lussan's normal houses.If we guess that it had some features that the normal houses didn't have (its own well, thicker walls, etc.)  Then, perhaps it cost as much as 10 or 12 normal houses.The town of Lussan has some 80 or so houses, so the castle cost about 15% of the total cost of all the buildings in Lussan.  Except, this did not include the town wall (which might well have cost more than the castle).Another way to look at it is that with a population of 480 people, Lussan probably had a workforce that could be assembled for castle building of circa 100 people for short periods of the year (after harvest, before planting).  With a few masons, carpenters and building specialists working full time on the castle, year round, and a work force of about 100 working for 6 weeks in the year each (40 days was a traditional service period in Medieval times).  The village might have spent about 870 man weeks a year building the castle.If it took two years to build the castle (that includes quarrying and shaping all the stone, felling and trimming all the lumber),  then that might be circa 1740 man weeks of labor.  Or about the same as 20 man years per year for two years.The labor would be the main cost to the village of building the castle.  They had the stone quarries on their land.  They had the trees in the local forest.  For a couple of years they had to devote their collective service and some of their stone and lumber resources to building a castle rather than building houses, or a mill, or barns, or maintaining the roads.The small castle of Lussan would have been the home of one knight (the local seigneur) and his family and servants.Of course, there were many larger and grander castles, royal castles and great fortresses, which cost much much more to build, but the average small castle might have cost the effort of all the service of a village for about two years.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The average castle would have cost between \u00a3500 and \u00a31,000 to build.

However, I hope that I can provide some sixth-century context for this unique edict.First all, it is important to note that the existing law was not repealed. Rather, this new edict opened a pathway for former actresses to marry imperial officials, as once they had abandoned their career, they could now petition the emperor for the right to a legitimate marriage. So yes, this was a law issued around 523 to allow Justinian to marry Theodora, but it was in fact far more specific than that, as it was only applicable to former actresses who had somehow managed to convince the emperor or the court that they have truly 'reformed'. As a result, this legislation cannot have affected too many people and was certainly not an attempt to rollback centuries of Roman tradition on this issue. By this stage, Theodora was an established person at court, had long abandoned her previous career, and had already been the mistress of an imperial official in Libya, so she was a very different person from an average actress and no doubt only one of a few who could actually take advantage of the new law. Historians have therefore suggested, quite rightly I think, that this was an edict that was specifically aimed at correcting Theodora's legal position, rather than a more general reform. We can, for instance, point also to an additional provision for daughters of former actresses - rather than children. As Theodora did have a daughter at this point, it would suggest that this edict was indeed meant to be a very narrow one. As some of the removed comments have suggested that this law was needed because an actress was equivalent to a prostitute, I need to add that whilst actresses were often painted as prostitutes in literary sources, late Roman law was careful to distinguish between the two, and the law for former prostitutes was definitely more restrictive, so it would suggest that what was problematic about Theodora's past was that she was once a actress, not that she was a prostitute. The most well-known source for Theodora's scandalous earlier career is Procopius' *Secret History*, the purpose of which was to defame Justinian and Theodora, so we have to be very careful about trusting its account of Theodora's life. It is true that the more favourable John of Ephesus also said that Theodora came from a *porneion*, which meant brothel in Classical Greek, but in a different context Justinian decreed that performers of comedies, tragedies and other theatrical performances from a *porneion* should march together in a procession - which suggests that in a sixth-century context a *porneion* also referred to a theatre. There is no doubt that Theodora's career was rather scandalous compared to most of the empresses whom we know about (though the previous empress, Euphemia, was actually an ex-slave), but we have to tread carefully when exploring the available sources. At the very least, we should not trust Procopius' deeply negative account, as he had no intention of writing about the empress favourably or, indeed, truthfully.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Byzantine Empire was a powerful empire that ruled over a large part of Europe.

That said, the Greeks and Romans certainly recognized a canon of \"old masters,\" of whom the most celebrated was probably Apelles. Pliny the Elder, at least, was a fan: \"Single-handed, he \\[Apelles\\] contributed more to painting than all the others together, and even went so far as to publish some treatises on the principles of the art. The great point of artistic merit with him was his singular charm of gracefulness, and this too, though the greatest of painters were his contemporaries.\"Apelles was the court painter of Alexander the Great (who made it illegal for any other painter to represent him), and was so favored that the king - or so were told - allowed the artist to marry his favorite concubine. Apelles, it was said, made this concubine his model for his famous painting of Aphrodite rising from the sea. Unfortunately, no painting of Apelles (or any other Greek master) survives. Many of his masterpieces were brought to Rome, where they were displayed in porticoes and temples. Even in antiquity, however, these had begun to decay. Pliny, for example, describes the fate of Apelles' painting of Aphrodite rising from the sea:\"The lower part of the picture having become damaged, no one could be found to repair it....Time, however, and damp at last effaced the painting, and Nero, in his reign, had it replaced by a copy, painted by the hand of Dorotheus \\[a contemporary artist\\]\"We do possess a few impressive examples of fourth-century Greek painting, above all the frescoes in the Tomb of Philip II at Vergina.

Since it isn't immediately obvious at birth, it isn't likely that autistic children were exposed for their disability.

A severely disabled child was probably not likely to survive and even if parents wanted to help, it's unlikely that they would have had the resources to do so.

So in order to perform fire correction effectively, the shooter must fire in bursts. As an aside on tracers: it is not recommended to use them in clear weather (you can't see them) or use only tracers (they wear out the barrel). In \"Firing on stationary or disappearing targets\", the manual says: > A singular, clearly visible target is fired upon in short or long bursts depending on the importance of the target, its size, and the range. The longer the range, the longer the burst. Fire until the target is destroyed or it disappears....A disappearing target must be destroyed with bursts, where one burst quickly follows another....A group target, consisting of several clearly visible figures, must be fired upon in bursts, moving fire from one figure to the next....When the enemy attacks at a range of 200 m or closer, fire in long bursts, spreading fire along the front line.The spreading of fire is achieved by shifting your assault rifle (machinegun) along the horizon. The speed of the shift is dictated by the range and required density of fire. In any case, the density of fire must be at least two bullets per each meter of the target.In \"Firing on moving targets\" > When firing using the method of waiting for the target (fire assault), the rifleman (machinegunner) aims at a point selected in front of the target, and as soon as the target is within 1.5-2 points in the table *[a table of offsets is attached to this page]* fires a long burst. If the target is not hit, he selects a new point in front of the target at the correct offset, etc.The same technique works when shooting at low flying aircraft and parachutists, except the table of offsets is different.I think you get the idea by now, so I'll summarize the rest. The tendency is to fire in short bursts when you have a good view of the target and a good idea of where it will be, long bursts when the target is poorly visible, moving, etc. The exception is that when you're running, you fire in short bursts, but you fire in long bursts when riding a truck.

Additionally, the scholarly writing on other canons of literature and literary production tend to be in the language that they are discussing and I am sadly mostly monolingual. That out of the way, let\u2019s take a look at this. > *The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, Of York, Mariner: Who lived Eight and Twenty Years, all alone in an un-inhabited Island on the Coast of America, near the Mouth of the Great River of Oroonoque; Having been cast on Shore by Shipwreck, wherein all the Men perished but himself. With An Account how he was at last as strangely deliver'd by Pyrates*Published in 1719, the first edition of *Robinson Crusoe* bore this excruciatingly long title, holding true to the tendencies of a book trade that had been developing and flourishing in England since William Caxton started up the first English printers in 1476. I use *Robinson Crusoe* here because it is arguably one of the first English \u201cnovels\u201d, but I could have chosen pretty much any book from before the late 18^th century. You can see that these old books did not merely have what we would consider titles. Rather, these were pretty much full-scale summaries of the work on display (though in the case of *Robinson Crusoe* it mentions events that don\u2019t actually occur in the book, namely the \u201cpyrates\u201d). So, what was the purpose of these ridiculously long titles, and what occurred to shorten them down to a title of just a few words, maybe involving a subtitle?The likely main purpose of these summary-as-titles was to sell the book. They were to give people a general idea of what the book was about so that they could better decide whether they wanted to purchase it, much the same as dust-jacket or back-cover blurbs function for us today. And according to Franco Moretti, this worked great until the point that book publishing really began to take off. When printing first came to England and up until around the beginning of the 18^th century there would only be a small handful of new books printed within a year. By the early 19^th century, we see over a hundred books printed every year (Moretti 139). This potentially created an environment where the amount of new material, on top of the existing old material, made it impractical enough for people to read a whole summary page for every single book that they might not bother at all. It became a bigger financial incentive to catch people\u2019s attention with a shorter, but evocative title due to the much higher turnover of stock. Additionally, Moretti points out the increase of literature about literature through production of magazine reviews and advertisements that could serve the purpose of providing summary, allowing authors and printers to craft shorter titles and leaving the job of summary to others. On the other hand, in her response to Moretti\u2019s article, Trumpener points out that these various reviews and everything would not have been seen or accessible to everyone, especially while they were in the shop trying to purchase something, so it is somewhat irresponsible to assign too much responsibility to them without a more in-depth study. Regardless, by the middle of the 19^th century around 30% of book titles were 1-5 words, with a similar percentage being 6-10 words. This is opposed to the roughly 5% of books in the 18^th century that had 3 or less words in the title.So what about the subtitles then? The argument can be made that the subtitles helped to serve the role of the summary-as-title from earlier, providing slightly more context to a work. The main title catches the reader\u2019s eye and the subtitle hooks them. Personally, I don\u2019t think that argument holds much water. For every *Frankenstein; or The Modern Prometheus* there is a *Wuthering Heights*, for every *Oliver Twist; or, the Parish Boy\u2019s Progress* there is a *Pride and Prejudice*, for every *Peter Pan; or the Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up* there is a *Great Expectations*. And on and on and on. We can see from the statistics given earlier, 1-5 word titles (5 words being really the minimum length to accommodate a subtitle, if Frankenstein is anything to go by) were about equal in prevalence to works with titles of 6-10 words (about the maximum size for a subtitle before you get back into the territory of summary-as-title in my eyes but feel free to disagree). Moretti\u2019s study is concerned solely with the length of the title though so does not provide much of any info on the actual prevalence of the use of subtitling. Sadly, I do not have access to Moretti\u2019s database and lack the time to do my own analysis (though honestly, it would probably be pretty fun) so I cannot say for sure beyond my own suppositions on how prevalent such subtitling really was. But assuming for a second that subtitling was in fact fairly prominent, and that Moretti\u2019s thoughts on the shortening of titles are accurate: printing continued to ramp up and it continued to become more and more paramount that titles be shortened, be punchy, be memorable. Superfluous extra details fleshing things out get left on the wayside.Now the interesting thing is actually cases like *Wuthering Heights*, because while I cite it as an example of lacking subtitle it actually does have a subtitle: \u201cA Novel.\u201d Which raises the question of subtitle as indicator of genre. Moretti has no interest in such subtitles, leaving almost all of them out of his analysis of title lengths. Now, whether you choose to count that as an actual subtitle or not is up to you but at least for the moment I will. This ups the average word count of book titles while also lending more credence to the idea that subtitles on novels/books were anymore prevalent than works without them. Anyways, many works had such genre labels appended on or the genre(s) was contained in part of the title to begin with. While way earlier than the time periods being discussed think *The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus*. While a fictional account, it is still marked as a \u201chistory\u201d in the title. All sorts of genres would be seen that way: tales, romance, novel, etc. However, there were also plenty of works that contained no indication of genre at all on their title page, and when genres were assigned they do not necessarily match how we would think of those genres nowadays. Publishers and writers of the time \u201cseem to have been making choices about labels based on what readers would want \u2013 that is, the changing trends in fiction.\u201d (Orr 77) So, a book\u2019s title, subtitle/listed genre would be created to best catch someone\u2019s attention (keep coming back to this, don\u2019t I?) and potentially, in the case of genre, mark the work as being linked thematically, or otherwise, to other popular works. And such a use isn\u2019t necessarily limited to the genre terms. It is entirely possible that a writer or publisher on a whim added a subtitle to their book, it got popular, and other books played follow the leader to capitalize on a trend. So when that particular style of book started to be less popular, the subtitles went away to differentiate the new works from the ailing genre. As for when it fell out of favor? Impossible to say. There are still a few writers, particularly in lit-fic, who will utilize it for stylistic reasons. Just look at Cormac McCarthy\u2019s *Blood Meridian or The Evening Redness in the West*. Intentionally trying to call back to a perceived older style of account. Then there are books like *Harry Potter and the X of Y* which call to mind the longer subtitled or summary-as-title books. Additionally, if you count the \u201cA Novel\u201d label as a subtitle, then that is still definitely going strong. *American Gods: A Novel*, *Making Money: A Discworld Novel*, *Independent People: An Epic*, etc. Really, the only one that has completely fallen out of favor is the page long summary-as-title. But for the most part, as you\u2019ve said subtitles have died away in the world of novels. Again, if you give credence to the arguments I\u2019ve discussed, it would seem to be a continuation of the oversaturation trend and the need for short, punchy titles to grab people\u2019s attention along with shifts in what writers/publishers think will best get people to buy the book. This is a convenient and logical enough explanation, but there isn\u2019t much really to directly support it outside of Moretti\u2019s analysis which is hobbled by only treating the internal influence of the English book trade and completely ignoring influences from outside that world, namely the trends of the book trades in nearby countries (just like this answer). But really, while I can discuss the developmental history up to about the Victorian age, there just isn\u2019t much out there (that I could find) that discusses the more modern developments and trends of novel titling so this is about the best that I can do without more recent and more in-depth studies being done. Hopefully that answered at least some of what you were wondering.**References**Moretti, Franco. \u201cStyle, Inc.

Some actually came to fruition thanks to dynastic and military manoeuvres. I name the Angevin Empire of the 12th-13th century as an example. So the one proposed by Guy Mollet, 94th Prime Minister of France, was not without precedence.**Context**It came about as France and the UK were colluding with each other during the Suez Crisis. Mollet, an argent anglophile, apparently suggested it in September 1956 to Sir Anthony Eden who was the Prime Minister of the UK at the time.There are some sources on-line which mention that a union was proposed because France was in the throws of economic difficult ([source](_URL_10_)) however this goes against historical fact.

The 4th Republic, established after the WWII was a parliamentary system of government but it was very unstable.  Political coalitions work elsewhere but in France, they don't appear to have ever worked. It was the same under the 3rd Republic (99 administrations from 1879-1940 ([source](_URL_5_) in French) and it \\[instability\\] was the same under the 4th Republic ([source](_URL_9_)). It had 24 administrations in 11 years ([source in French](_URL_8_))Because of this instability at home, it could not manage or define agreed and coherent policies for the sprawling [French Union/French Empire](_URL_6_). There was open revolt in French West Africa, French Indochina and Algeria - all of which wanted self-determination and decolonisation. The Algiers Crisis in 1958 compelled French politicians to call De Gaulle from retirement, takeover the government and advocate major constitutional reform to establish the current 5th Republic. [(This source gives an outline of its establishment)](_URL_3_)**Proposal**Eden rejected Mollet's initial scheme of union between the two states. Having studied Eden at length, one can imagine what he said first! However, Mollet returned with a suggestion of France joining the Commonwealth of Nations to which Eden was more receptive. A common citizenship was proposed and France would recognise the monarch of the UK as Head of the Commonwealth in accordance with the [London Declaration](_URL_4_). Alas, this was ultimately rejected too ([source](_URL_0_)).**Realistic?**We only know of this curious footnote in the history of Europe because a British civil servant minuted his conversation with Sir Norman Brooke, Cabinet Secretary and head of the British Civil Service. There are no real facts of what was behind Mollet's proposal: economic, political or otherwise. Perhaps he was conjecturing.There are merits in evaluating the British Westminster-system as a bastion of stability compared with the French 4th Republic: 4 Prime Minsters and effectively 2 governments between 1945-1963. The Conservatives from 1951 changed Prime Minister but there was few major policy shifts. While a monarchy is noted for providing stability: Elizabeth has been on the throne since 1952; Baudouin of the Belgians reigned for 42 years and Wilhelmina of the Netherlands for 58 years.One doubts that either France or the UK would have tolerated such a union. The citizens of Paris would have been on the streets and perhaps the 4th Republic would have collapsed 2 years before it did if Mollet's scheme became public.**Curiosity**It is curious to note that 2 years later in 1958, France signed the Treaty of Rome with 5 other nations to establish what became the EU. Was Mollet attempting to create a bolstered *Entente Cordiale* or a rival to Treaty of Rome economic free-trade area with a proposed Franco-British Union? If so, we would have entered into another period of European (economic) Alliance systems: Franco-Britain, EEC and Comecon (for the Soviet Union and their satellite states).**Edit: Academic Sources**1.

Whether it's the Lyre chronicle's cursory note \"People made processions\" or the involved, tragic tale of Alberic of Troisfontaines, there's plenty of evidence for a mass of people on the move from north to south for religious purposes. And to be clear, north to south means *hiking the Alps.* The questions for scholars today are whether the participants were or were exclusively children, whether it counts as a crusade, and whether it should be singular or plural.The middle question is a judgment call. Even Thomas Madden, who says \"The Children's Crusade was not an army of children, and it was not a crusade,\" accepts the chroniclers' story that a mass of people, starting somewhere around Cologne and growing larger as they moved south, had in mind to re-recapture Jerusalem from Muslims. Kelly DeVries notes that it wasn't a crusade in the typical sense because they weren't an *army*, but (although he doesn't say it) I think Madden has something different in mind.That is to say, the (so-called?) Children's Crusade was not a Crusade because it was neither started nor recognized by the Church. A crusade was defined by the vow taken by crusaders, but also by the declaration and indulgence offered by the papacy. The Children's Crusade lacked this official sanction. A reasonable comparison is the disastrous 1096 \"People's Crusade\" that stormed eastward across Europe while the official crusaders with Pope Urban II's approval were still packing their bags. We call it \"Crusade,\" but it doesn't get the fancy designation of \"First.\"The more troublesome issue is the moniker *Children's*. There are two basic roots for the crusade consisting of children. First, some chronicle accounts mention that a boy less than twelve/less than ten named Nicholas was the leader. Second, the Latin *pueri* is indeed frequently used to describe the participants, sometimes accompanied by the female counterpart *puellae*. It is in fact reasonable to translate these as \"boys and girls.\"The difficulties, Peter Raedts argued, are that they didn't *necessarily* mean boys and girls, and that contemporary witnesses include many more categories of people. Social historians and historians of childhood note that \"puer\" can refer to unmarried men, especially agricultural day labourers. This use would fit in well with other evidence from the sources--parents trying to prevent their offspring from leaving since they'd be needed for field work at the time, and the frequent companion of *pastores* or shepherds as fellow crusaders. And while there's even a reference to breastfeeding infants making the journey, obviously these are accompanied by their mothers (including explicitly in the source) and some accounts note older people going as well. I'm not sure \"pastores\" is as decisive as some scholars have treated it; I often read about children (including girls) working as shepherds or watching other livestock in hagiographies and court cases. And this leads into somewhat of a split in scholarship. The sources are clear on the participation of children as well as adults; the question is, did contemporaries understand the crusade as *especially* a movement of children, or *especially* a movement of peasants. While rejecting Norman Cohn's view of the Children's Crusade as an anti-poverty protest, Peter Raedts argues that the terms used to describe the crusaders indicate that the chroniclers thought this crusade stood out because of the low social status of the participants. The complete omission to the presence of clergy *despite* mentions that the crusaders had official material objects of the Church along with them according to some chroniclers seems to suggest that there were in fact priests along the way, but they were omitted from the record in order to shape a view of it as the hardscrabble peasants'. Gary Dickson, on the other hand, has done the most extensive study of the *legend* of the Children's Crusade, starting with contemporary sources. He notes that easily within 50 years of the events themselves, chroniclers focus on the age in unambiguous terms (\"parvuli\" or small ones). This suggests that the idea of children going along was what captured people's imaginations. (The later accounts are generally more extensive--people were *talking* about this. So we shouldn't see a sharp split between 1212 and 1300, but rather a repetition/surprisingly accurate game of Premodern Telephone.) I should, however, point out that Dickson argues against the 19th century romantic image of all small children participants. (The construction of the myth, which he calls the unpronounceable mythistory, is much of the focus of his book.)The third question is whether Children's Crusade should be singular or plural. There is definitely the movement from Cologne to Italy. But did a simultaneous event arise in France near Vendome, and was it connected, and was it aimed at going to Paris to inspire the *king* to crusade or were the participants vowed towards Jerusalem? A mass procession from Vendome towards Paris is generally accepted. Dickson argues *hard* for a connection (despite, as he notes, the lack of \"direct evidence\"). To Raedts, on the other hand, the contemporary evidence is focused on a political-religious pilgrimage of sorts to Paris; it's only later that sources develop the idea of the group as a \"crusade\" or start to mention Jerusalem. Again, both scholars admit points for and against their particular view. (I personally would like to see more analysis of the later sources in light of debates over spiritual poverty and the priest versus friar rivalry, but spitballing right now it would probably just result in more fuel for both sides.)The wider problem that both Raedts and Dickson are grappling with in trying to deduce a possible link between the German and French movements, and I would argue debating whether this should be the Children's Crusade or the Peasants' Crusade, is--surprise, surprise--historical context. 1212 is *right* on the cusp of 1215, when the Fourth Lateran Council will commit the Church to the instruction and pastoral care of lay people. This doesn't come out of nowhere--it's the result of Church officials recognizing that over the course of the twelfth century, the proletariat Got Religion and are going to exercise it with or without the Church. In addition to the proliferation of new monastic orders (indeed, the entire *concept* of different monastic orders) in the 12th century, which arose from the nobility and new urban aristocracy, there were more \"popular\" movements of people coming together to practice and preach Christianity. You'd think this would be awesome for the Church, but prelates tended to see these movements as a threat, since they initially operated outside clerical hierarchy. The Waldensians (who believed in lay preaching) were condemned as heretics; the Franciscans, who were started by a lay man preaching, quickly had their historiography overwritten as Francis being a deacon (this is why Francis is always preaching to animals in his iconography; he wasn't actually a cleric); the all-woman beguines steered a perilous course between acceptance and suppression. A frequent feature of these groups was a commitment to poverty as a spiritual ideal. They weren't calling for peasants seizing the means of production or the end of a nobility, but instead insisting that \"the poor\" had a spiritual role to play where rich people had failed, and an insistence on poverty as a way to imitate Christ. We should read the chroniclers' accounts through this lens of poverty as an ideal (not one they particular wished to claim for themselves, naturally), as well as the actual fact of poor and middle class people claiming an active and formative religious role for themselves.So something absolutely happened in 1212, something emblematic of the surge in religiosity sweeping over Western Europe at the time. Although many elements of the \"traditional\" (Victorian medievalist) view have been decisively overturned, whether it's accurate or badhistory to call it Children's or Crusade isn't an entirely settled question.Further Reading:* Peter Raedts, \"The Children's Crusade of 1212,\" *Journal of Medieval History 3, no. 4 (1977)* Gary Dickson, *The Children\u2019s Crusade: Medieval History, Modern Mythistory* (2008)* Kelly DeVries, \"Teenagers at War During the Middle Ages,\" in *The Premodern Teenager: Youth in Society, 1150-1650*, ed.

Least of all from fellow Democrats. According to Michael Beschloss, people wrote to the DNC in protest at a rate one hundred times what they mentioned in support. While we can count on the general principle of online reviews--upset people are the most motivated to leave comments--the scale of difference backs up information gleaned from interviews and letters with prominent government officials. Media reaction, too, was initially sharply against the appointment. After Jack floated the idea to a New York Times reporter well in advance of a formal arrangement being announced, the paper printed an editorial not quite as blistering as Johnson's version but nevertheless firm: >  It is simply not good enough to name a bright young political manager, no matter how bright or how young or how personally loyal, to a major post in government that by rights (if not by precedent) ought to be kept completely out of the political arena.There's something interesting about this sentiment, though. Nepotism doesn't even merit an explicit mention. The *Times* is first and foremost unhappy with Bobby's previous role as campaign manager and especially his inexperience: >  If Robert Kennedy was one of the outstanding lawyers of the country, a preeminent legal philosopher, a noted prosecutor or legal officer at the Federal or State level, **the situation would have been different.**The *Wall Street Journal* went on record with the same sentiment, suggesting such an inexperienced AG would be an \"unqualified disaster.\"Russell and Johnson above protested similarly--Bobby wasn't qualified to be AG based on his own (lack of) merits, quite independent of concerns whether he might not be the *best of* a set of qualified appointees just getting the job because Jack needed a [right hand man](_URL_0_).A more interesting question is whether the appointment was/was ever controversial with *Bobby*. The Kennedy brothers certainly stage-managed it that way in the public eye. Jack did try to place several others in the AG role first, but they turned it down for reasons like not wanting to be a Jewish AG under a Catholic president trying to force civil rights legislation on a region that included a strong anti-Catholic, anti-Semitic, KKK or KKK-sympathizing element. Notes taken by Jack's secretary, Evelyn Lincoln, right before the appointment was formally announced in December 1960 indicate a phone conversation between the brothers, in which Jack tried to get Bobby to accept a whole spectrum of government roles--electoral, Cabinet-level, White House staff--but the latter was having none of it. Any of it. (\"Would rather write a book,\" Lincoln noted; \"as an interim thing, maybe a college presidency,\" related William Douglas). There was even a rumor circulated by Jack's allies that Kennedy family patriarch Joseph had put his sons up to it. This rumor is especially noteworthy because it would likely *stoke* fears/charges of nepotism rather than calm them--inexperience, it seems, really was the biggest sticking point....But was it so for Bobby? In fact, his own record is somewhat ambivalent on the matter. Even as Lincoln was making notes of that phone conversation, Bobby wrote in a letter: >  I made up my mind today and Jack and I take the plunge tomorrow. For many reasons I believe it was the only thing I could do--I shall do my best and hope that it turns out well.He might also have been concerned about his lack of experience, and it seems from other comments he *was* worried that having to enforce civil rights laws would backfire on his brother's popularity if they were seen as too close. But in 1965, long after it should have been an issue of immediate importance, Bobby was back to asserting his initial reluctance. Truth? Or cagey political move with an eye towards an even greater government role?Ultimately, of course, the calculation that an initial public and press outcry would quickly die down proved correct.

My case study was Sri Lanka, but I'll give examples from other nations here as well, for a more 'universal' approach. There are three means of reconciliation of violence and Buddhism I will distinguish here. Incidentally, these are not unique to Buddhists. Other religions handle their formal rejection of violence in a similar manner. First, Buddhism, like other religions, is linked to cultural and national identity. Buddhists would fight in protection of their nationstate and what they perceive as the \"keepers of the tradition\". They apply a larger-than-life mentality to the warfare. That is to say, the importance of continuing the tradition outweighs the views on morality they hold. (Daniel Kent (2010), 'Onward Buddhist Soldiers, Preaching to the Sri Lankan Army' in: *Buddhist Warfare*)   >  Soldiers don\u2019t shoot the enemy out of personal anger. If they shoot they do so for the common good. This war is on behalf of the country, people, religion, region, and motherland. It would be negative karma to shoot one\u2019s neighbor over a land conflict, but the intention here is a good one.Second, there are attempts to de-humanize the opponents. This is very similar to Christian and Islamic justification of violence. Opponents are represented as possessed by demons, thereby transforming the violence from a mortal to a sanctified action. (in: Michael Jerryson (2010), 'Militarizing Buddhism, Violence in Souther Thailand' in: *Buddhist Warfare*) >  [B]ecause whoever destroys the nation, the religion, or the monarchy, such bestial types [man] are not complete persons. Thus we must intend not to kill people but to kill the Devi [Ma\u0304ra]; this is the duty of all Thai. Third, karmic sacrifice. This is a classic case of multiple interpretations of (somewhat) ambiguous theology. Some individuals are considered such sinful beings, that they will only commit more crimes the longer they live. Killing these individuals can be considered a heroic act, because the killer will sacrifice his own karma in order to prevent the victim from committing more crimes and going to hell. (in: Derek Maher (2008), *The Rhetoric of War in Tibet*) >  [K]illings [can be] undertaken in order to preserve sinful opponents of Buddhism from committing worse crimes that could be expected to earn them more severe karmic retribution than if they had not been killed.Lastly, on a more personal note (hope that's allowed) there are some understandable misconceptions about Buddhism. (these same misconceptions incited my initial question for the aforementioned paper). Buddhism has many forms. And the majority of those forms has aspects similar to other religions. Please don't believe that \"Buddhism is more a philosophy than a religion\". Many forms of buddhism have gods, demons, heaven, hell, prayer for help, and rituals with magic properties. Therefore, evil and violence toward perceived evil is not at all uncommon among buddhists.

This creates a market opportunity for the foreign sellers, as well as political incentives for foreign statesmen to block those sales (in order to maintain a military advantage over the locals) and local statesmen to circumvent those controls (thus creating the conditions for a black market and criminal trading).I am aware of one such case historically, and that is the arrival of matchlock firearms in Japan in the mid-16th Century. These were carried by Portuguese traders, who were quite happy to demonstrate their destructive power to the local Japanese, who in turn were smart enough to recognize that this was a game-changing military technology, and immediately began scheming to buy as much as they could.The Lord of Tanegashima paid an exorbitant sum for the first guns to pass into Japanese hands, in the 1540s, and he immediately turned them over to his own weaponsmiths to figure out how to make more. However, the key technology was not the barrel or the firing mechanism, as you might think, but the threading of the breech. Japanese metal workers had no experience with that. So... back to the Portuguese for more arms dealing. This time the purchase was lessons in the fine points of gunsmithy from a Portuguese smith, and the price, according to legend, included the Lord's own daughter, which he willingly paid.With that knowledge, the Lord of Tanegashima was able to produce something like 600 guns of his own, and turn around and start selling them in turn to others in Japan. With that, the Portuguese monopoly on matchlock gun technology waned, and within a generation Japan was fielding armies of gunners and winning battles with them. By the time flintlock weapons were developed in Europe in the early 17th Century, the Portuguese were restricted to trading through Nagasaki only. Flintlock weapons never took strong root in Japan, so for whatever reason, the black market incentives did not encourage much in the way of further arms dealing, despite the fact that flintlocks were a significant advance over matchlocks.*Arms and Armour of the Samurai,* I Bottomley and A P Hopson, Chapter 6: *The Arrival of the Southern Barbarians*", "label": 0}, {"content": "The arms dealing as private enterprise existed in the medieval (or pre-modern firearms) eras, more than just a smith producing swords for the king's army.

This is important because the modern affinity for enjoying different kinds of exotic cuisine in one city is well, modern. Before the 20th century started local cuisine was local, traditional local dishes with almost all ingredients sourced locally.  There were not many restaurants in America in the higher end category 200 years go, this started taking off more in the mid 19th century. New York already had established it's current reputation for steak and chop houses though, and oyster houses, and New Orleans for creole, the local variant on classic French cooking with menus tailored to local seafood and game. Boston, as now, was a seafood town with clams crabs and saltwater fish popular. This was generally tavern and inn food, local country cooking served in a very informal atmosphere by a home trained cook. The very first French chefs who opened restaurants in the Us started to emigrate right around the turn of the century, with American restaurants in the fine dining style starting to pick up in the 1820's-1840's. Most European capitals at that time had enough traffic passing through for diplomacy, trade, and internal governance to support restaurant traffic. Until the late 18th century this also would have been limited mainly to taverns and inns though. The modern concept of fine dining is really an unintended consequence of the French Revolution. So many aristocratic manors were closed with the families either dead or gone that an entire class of highly trained chefs suddenly found themselves out of work and on the street all at once. With tavern eating fairly fashionable they started applying the advanced skills they had once used to entertain the aristocracy to the open marketplace. At the same time the power of old cooking guilds was broken by the new system allowing chefs a tremendous amount of freedom to experiment and offer variety. This meant anyone with money could walk up to a building, be given a seat, be offered a meal for a fixed price and have a tremendous variety of meal options prepared by a world class chef for the first time. This is where the modern concept of fashionable and artistic cuisine in restaurants really emerged.  As far as the menu goes, 200 years ago is right after the French Revolution, we are actually very close to the 200 year anniversary of Napoleon's first exile. So the restaurants at this time are at their very earliest state of development in France, and elsewhere still more low brow. Also, like today different restaurants did things differently. Food options are dominated by the food sourcing of that era. Everything is local, food that was transported any distance would have likely been barreled and salted, or pickled. Also, everything is seasonal, no fresh fruit and vegetables year round.  One likely form for a \"menu\" would be something like the modern prix fixe menus, where the restaurant charges a flat fee to serve a multi course meal. The dishes would be the best the chef could put together using seasonally available ingredients that were available that day. Alternately (and more popular on the high end of the scale) the idea of having choice was a huge draw for early restaurant customers, and some restaurants specialized in this, with menus that to the modern sensibility were incredibly busy and crowded, with dozens of options in every single category (entrees, soups, desserts, etc.). These restaurants would have had large dining areas, music, and proper service loosely based on (formerly) aristocratic standards. As for the food itself, or specific recipes? Wild game would have been a more common sight, and the cuts of meat would have been more variegated, with items like sweetbreads, tongue, head/face/jowl being prized over the more modern lean cuts from the flanks and ribs. The cooking was mainly the mode of what we now consider \"classic\" French cuisine, the kinds of things you find in Julia Child's cookbook, which is full of recipes that go back hundreds of years. There are some interesting histories on restaurants, part of the emerging and fascinating scholarship going into food in general in the last 30-40 years. A History of Cooks and Cooking by Michael Symons covers this early era, as does the Oxford Companion to Food.  If you want a free online translation of a very early bit of writing on the subject here is a link to a translation of the 1825 The Physiology of Taste, by Brillat-Savarin.

Wagyu beef is intensely marbled with softer fat, has higher percentages of monounsaturated fats, omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids and is lower in cholesterol than commodity beef. The combinations of these fats deliver a distinctive rich and tender flavor compared to other beef.**What is Kobe beef**Kobe beef is recognised as one of the best types of beef in the world, so much so that it is trademarked and like Champagne or Cornish pasties is a regional trademark meaning you can only produce it in a certain region. You can take a cow and bull from that region, breed them in an identical location with exactly the same feed and the calf when it grows will produce the exact same quality meat etc but cannot be called Kobe beef.Kobe beef therefore comes from the Hy\u014dgo prefecture (of which Kobe is the capital) of Japan. The cattle are fed special diet of dried pasture forage and grasses such as rice straw with nutrition-rich feed supplements made by blending soybean, corn, barley, wheat bran, and various other ingredients. They are not fed pasture grass.All Japanese beef is Wagyu, but not all Wagyu is KobeNow, what you normally see as Wagyu is not actually from Japan, America (I'm assuming you're American here)  actually banned imports of beef from Japan between 2009 and 2012. However Wagyu was still very common in the US, how? Because whilst *Kobe* beef is regional, Wagyu is a style and breed of cattle. Therefore the majority of places serving this style of beef are actually importing it from Australia or using domestic American Wagyu. (or importing it from either country if you're not in the US) Actual Kobe beef is around $200 a steak and $50 a burger. It's unlikely you're seeing it commonly at any restaurant outside of Japan, they simply don't produce that much of it. Now, back to my original point. The question is leading because Wagyu beef is considered one of the world's best beefs but Japan is considered one of, but not the only great beef producing nations. _URL_2_There is even a world steak challenge_URL_0_In fact, this year Japan didn't even win a single  medal. Finland, Germany, Poland, Ireland, The United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand all did very well however. But let's just talk about the history now, rather than the culinary and current beefs of the world (other than Eminem and MGK) as this is ask historians, not ask chefs**History of Cattle in Japan**Cattle were estimated to have been introduced in Japan between 500BC and 300AD from the Asian continent as domestic animals. (McKay et al 2008), this has been narrowed down to the third century AD coinciding with the growth of rice cultivation by Mannen et al 2004 . Cattle were primarily used in forestry, transportation and rice farming whilst horses were fundamentally used by the military (Minezawa, 2003).However they weren't primarily used as food or for milking due to bans by Buddhist leaders on the eating of flesh particularly from 4 legged creatures. As such breeding was primarily based on physical prowess. This changed in 1867 when the ban was lifted during the Meij restoration and cattle bedchamber being imported from Kobe to Yokohoma after the port was opened there and the beef was sold as Kobe beef which became very popular with foreigners who had become more frequent by this timeA decision was made to increase body size and milk production by introducing improved breeds of cattle. Initially Shorthorn and Devon were imported in 1868. About 2,600 head from British and Continental breeds were introduced in a ten year period and crossed with the native cattle in the prefectures [Here](_URL_3_)(from Minezawa, 2003 and Namikawa, 1992):High prices were paid for the crossbreds at the turn of the century, but by 1910 they were considered to be inferior for work so all crossing ceased. There had been some improvement in size and milk yield, but productivity and meat quality had deteriorated.The core breeds which collectively became known as \"Wagyu\" had evolved. They are derived from native cattle that had been crossed with imported breeds to improve size.After mechanisation reduced the demands for draught after the 1950s, the focus on beef production changed. Until then selection had been for body size and growth rate. The correlation of height at withers with body size was established and this produced an increase in body size. Performance and progeny testing was started in 1968. Young bulls with good growth had their progeny performance tested. Subsequently it has been established that the marbling index improved 0.05 points each year in three prefectures in response to these practices. There had been no improvement during the previous period when breeding decisions were made on visual assessment alone (Sasaki et al., 2006).**From domesticity to one of the best known types of beef in the world**For a long time cattle in Japan were not farmed for milk nor meat, this meant that cattle had been treated better than those elsewhere. As there were only a few heads of cattle in each farm they were treated much like we treat horses, rather than the vast ranches of for example the USA. This meant their were individual  sheds which were well ventilated and properly maintained. Fresh water is always available and exercise was not encouraged. Cattle were carefully brushed to maintain good blood flow to maintain a healthy coat. The belief is that the fat is evenly distributed through brushing. Some producers brush with Sake (beer) to improve the appearance and softness of the coat. Massaging is another indication of the closeness the farmer has to their precious cattle and is carried out to relieve stress and muscle stiffness.This is not scientifically proven though, however it is believed that the lack of stress and constant handling helps in the quality of beef. _URL_1_The actual recognition of Japanese beef comes much much more recently. Japan only lifted a ban on imported beef in 1991, it was this liberalisation that caused farmers to focus on high quality beef rather than high quantity beef. As such Japan actually imports 60% of its domestic beef consumption. The Japanese government have been increasingly protective of their domestic exports and that includes beef. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\u00a0is responsible for the  agricultural export driveDespite this, Japan are experiencing a decline in the beef, with far fewer households raising far more cattle per household and an increasingly elderly population of farmers too with young people in Japan unwilling to live the lifestyle raising wagyu cattle requires which is full time living in the countryside. Other producers such as Australia, The USA, New Zealand and the UK are also growing their own domestic markets and all the countries mentioned have wagyu cattle in farms across the countries.", "label": 0}, {"content": "Japan has a long history of raising cattle, and the country has a long tradition of raising cattle in a way that is akin to the way people raise horses.

So, for context, Mike Love was (sort of) the main lead singer (and very occasional saxophonist) in the Californian rock'n'roll band/vocal group formed in the early 1960s called first the Pendletones and then the Beach Boys. Love was the cousin of the Wilson brothers Brian (who played bass), Dennis (drums), and Carl (guitar) (the group also had a second guitarist - initially Al Jardine, and then David Marks, and then Al Jardine again). All members of the Beach Boys sang, the group vocal harmonies being a prominent part of their sound. Mike Love's nasal, conversational vocal style contrasted with Brian Wilson's pure-sounding falsetto, with the two singers being sort of co-lead singers; the typical Beach Boys song would have Love sing the verse melody (e.g., \"if everybody had an ocean, across the USA...\" in 'Surfin' USA') and Wilson sing the chorus melody (e.g., \"Everybody's gone surfin', surfin' USA\").Within the Beach Boys, while Mike Love was sort of the outward face of the band - the extroverted lead singer who was probably the most natural entertainer in the band - Brian Wilson was the leader of the band musically; he initially co-wrote the songs with Mike, with Mike writing the lyrics, and Brian writing the music. By 1963 or so, a couple of years into the Beach Boys' recording career, Brian was also officially producing the music, meaning that he was directing the musicians and studio engineers in the creation of the recorded product (i.e., the role that George Martin had for the Beatles).  The Wilson brothers' overbearing father Murry regularly physically abused his children, and each was marked by this abuse in different ways. One thing likely influenced by this to some extent was that, over the early lifespan of the band, Brian Wilson suffered from mental health problems that would increasingly sit somewhere on a spectrum of mental illness that includes schizophrenia (edit: though not being Wilson's psychiatrist, I'm shouldn't assume a diagnosis), and which his increasing drug usage in the mid-1960s did not help. In 1964, Brian Wilson quit the Beach Boys' fairly incessant touring schedule for mental health reasons, instead focusing on the studio process. This led to an odd situation where he would work on songs in the studio with L.A. session musicians from what later became known as 'Wrecking Crew' such as Hal Blaine and Carole Kaye, and then the Beach Boys would fly in from being on tour to hear their next hit (with Love not being around, Wilson then sought co-writers in the likes of the radio DJ Roger Christian, the advertising writer Tony Asher and then the music scene socialite Van Dyke Parks).This situation worked, however; the Beach Boys' era of biggest success, commercially, is marked by this division of labour - the Wrecking Crew's versatility and professionalism meant that Brian could create sonic landscapes with emotional heft that the Beach Boys themselves would have struggled to create as quickly and painlessly.Mike Love, as well as being the lead singer in the Beach Boys, also was the oldest member of the band, being five years older than the youngest Wilson brother Carl Wilson; in 1963, Mike Love turned 22 and Carl Wilson turned 17 (Brian turned 21). Love was also the oldest member of the band in terms of life experience; he was already a married father by the time the band formed in 1961, where the Wilson brothers, with their upbringing, were a bit more sheltered. Love's political and aesthetic preferences are also, shall we say, quite conservative. He was profoundly distrustful of the evolution of pop music through the 1960s in California.In contrast, Brian Wilson was open to the evolution of pop music through the 1960s, and in fact as a producer of massively successful commercial music who fully intended to keep up with the Joneses/Beatles, he could not afford to ignore it. Thus, Brian Wilson (like the Beatles) played a role somewhere between following the Zeitgeist of the era musically, and expanding the Zeitgeist himself. So what we have here, in terms of the beginnings of the 'Brian vs Mike' thing in this era is two very different views of what pop music should be; Mike's belief in a formula, formed through observation of what worked with the audiences he played to every day, versus Brian's more progressive studio-based vision. Generally, so long as Brian's vision led to hits, Mike Love grumbled about the difficulties of replicating the sound live (something Brian didn't have to deal with), but didn't make a huge fuss. However, in 1966-1967 (as fairly well portrayed in the film *Love And Mercy*), Brian's lovable eccentricities and artistic vision became to look increasingly closer to the proper onset of diagnosable schizophrenia - not that the rest of the band really understood it in those terms at the time. Firstly, Brian had put much effort in the studio into 1966's *Pet Sounds*, but this effort - at the time - seemed to mark the point at which question marks started to be raised about Brian. Mike Love, shall we say, did not receive the album purely positively upon hearing it, convincing Brian to change the lyrics in the song 'Hang Onto Your Ego' sufficiently that the title was changed to 'I Know There's An Answer', concerned about the hip L.A. drug slang in the original lyrics. And despite that Brian was focused on the idea of a coherent concept album, in response to his understanding of The Beatles' *Rubber Soul*, the Beach Boys' record label Capitol did not quite understand the idea of The Beach Boys making a statement album in 1966; they did only the bare minimum to promote *Pet Sounds* in the US, releasing a greatest hits album only weeks later. Nonetheless, Brian then went about recording the group's next project *SMiLE*, working with the counterculture-aligned surrealist lyricist Van Dyke Parks. The record company - after The Beatles' *Revolver* and then knowing about what the Beatles were about to do with *Sgt Peppers* - hired Beatles publicity guy Derek Taylor to explain Brian Wilson's genius to the public, priming the public for an odd concept album from a group they might have still mostly associated with surfing and cars and girls. Derek Taylor's publicity for the band is at the heart of the idea that Brian walks upon water, and I gather that Mike Love strongly resented this PR angle as the band's frontman. Additionally, *SMiLE* marks the point where Brian Wilson's music becomes truly eccentric. *Pet Sounds* might not have been 'surf, cars and girls', but it was mostly 'girls', albeit from a more adult perspective mixed in with a bit of existentialism that fit right into 1966's general vibe (Brian's use of Tony Asher as lyricist demonstrates the commerciality of the project - Asher being a advertising copywriter). The *SMiLE* project began with 'Good Vibrations', which really was pop genius and one of the band's biggest hit. But as it went on, the project seemed increasingly...esoteric.Mike Love's criticism of *SMiLE*, when he returned home from the band's latest tour, seems to have been more strident than his criticism of *Pet Sounds*, and it ultimately seems to have been a tipping point that caused the *SMiLE* project to collapse; Van Dyke Parks, freaked out by Love's negative energy, quit the project after Love asked him what his lyrics mean (in 'Surf's Up', one prominent lyric is \"columnated ruins domino\"). In Brian Wilson's increasingly fragile mental state, this was enough to push him over the edge into a mental health episode of some sort (involving hearing voices, and some paranoid ideation, whatever the actual diagnosis should have been), bringing the *SMiLE* project to an end. The rest of the band would release a sort of stopgap re-recorded *SMiLE* in the album *Smiley Smile*, and with Brian increasingly out-of-it, the group's focus in the late 1960s become nostalgic songs like 'Do It Again'; Mike Love was increasingly calling the shots.", "label": 0}, {"content": "Wilson was a controversial figure in the Beach Boys because of his homosexuality.

That Wikipedia article is kind of wrong, the annexation was not so abrupt as it was anti-climatic, but there was a long build up which I will only skim the surface of. To begin with, the island of Cyprus was part of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, the last overseas territory of a dying (practically dead) empire. And it was vital. In Antiquity Cyprus acted as a link between Egypt, the Near East, and Greece, which was of both strategic and commercial importance. During the Ptolemaic period, Cyprus was an important source of revenue through trade and taxation, and was one of a few sites used for extensive coin minting. #The precedent for Cyprus as a separate entity from EgyptSince the 2nd Century BCE, Cyprus was a headquarters for rival claimants to the Ptolemaic throne, an alternate capital to threaten Alexandria from. Civil wars created a repeated precedent for the division of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, and this will become important later. Although the Ptolemids controlled regions stretching from some outlying Greek islands, to Coele-Syria in the Levant, to northern Nubia, it shrank rapidly. The Seleucid Empire gnawed at it, while insurrections and political instability ate it from the inside out. It was a necessity when Ptolemaic rulers began relying on the growing Roman Republic for support and aid. The Romans had their own antagonism with the Seleucids and their allies Macedonians, so the enemy of their enemy was their friend and ally. This relationship led to Roman politicians being asked to mediate succession crises and rival claims to the Ptolemaic throne. While various Ptolemaic dynasts found temporary allies in Judaea, Syria, and certain Greek cities and leagues, their most powerful ally was undoubtedly Rome.Flash forward to c. 163 BCE, Ptolemy VI Philometor ruled most of the kingdom, while his younger brother Ptolemy VIII Physkos ruled Cyrene (Libya). This partition of power had been created with the aid and advice of the Roman Senate. The unhappy Ptolemy VIII began preparing to seize more territory by force, prompting Philometor to ask the Roman Senate to intervene. The senators decided that it would be wise to forgo violence, and for the younger brother to rule Cyprus, while the other remained in Egypt. The Greek historian Polybius later stated in hindsight that the Roman Senate was deliberately helping to fragment the sizeable empire into smaller, less threatening chunks. Whether this was actually the intentions of the Roman Senate or not, it was the result.#The legal precedent for Roman annexation of CyprusWe can gloss over a few decades of very complicated violence and shifting alliances in the Hellenistic east, down to the reign of Ptolemy Soter II and Ptolemy X Alexander, after the death of Ptolemy VIII. Both had been elevated by two previous co-rulers, Cleopatra II and Cleopatra III, who were essentially vying against each other by appointing their favourite of the two brothers.When the two brothers inevitably fought each other, Ptolemy X Alexander found himself forced out of the Ptolemaic Kingdom and desperate for help. Ptolemy Alexander gathered an army with money borrowed from Roman creditors, and as surety he made a will that ceded his claimed kingdom to Rome in the event that he perished in the upcoming conflict. It was not unprecedented for a king to leave his kingdom to the Roman Republic, as it ensured that his kingdom would be safe. Beyond this, similar deals had been made by Ptolemaic dynasts in the past, it just so happened that *they* lived.Ptolemy X Alexander did not live. But after he fell in battle his will was ignored and Ptolemy Soter II continued to rule his kingdom comfortably. In 88 BCE, Mithridates of Pontus conquered the island of Kos, and captured the Ptolemaic princes living there. If this seems like a huge deal, it was. One prince known as Ptolemy XI Alexander II was able to escape and became the ward of the Roman dictator Sulla. After Ptolemy Soter II died, Sulla was keen to place his malleable companion on the throne, and arranged Ptolemy XI Alexander II\u2019s marriage to the Queen of Egypt, Cleopatra Berenike. Ptolemy XI Alexander II messed this up by killing his popular wife, which resulted in his own murder by an angry mob. This would have been a fantastic opportunity for the Romans to annex all of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, but the Roman Republic was also divided and plagued by in-fighting. The Roman Senate had a powerful reason to oppose the annexation of the Ptolemaic Kingdom. It was believed that any general who had the opportunity to seize the wealth, glory, and prestige that such a war would have guaranteed would be far too powerful. Therefore it was simply left on the side, a tense prospect for all parties.The Egyptians were nervous at the possibility of Roman conquest, and knew they had to quickly place *someone* on the throne. It was quickly decided that two sons of Ptolemy IX would be called home from the Kingdom of Pontus where they were living as wards. These two princes were apparently bastards, although it is uncertain whether they were actually illegitimate or not. One was made King of Egypt and is known to history as Ptolemy XII \u201cthe flute player\u201d, and the other is simply referred to by historians as Ptolemy of Cyprus. By 80 BCE, the Ptolemaic Kingdom was therefore split in two, as had happened in the past, with a ruler in Egypt and another in Cyprus. This time however, it was more official and probably a deliberate attempt to ease Roman nerves by dividing the kingdom into smaller pieces.#Why it was Cyprus and not EgyptFor obvious reasons the existence of a Roman legal claim to the Ptolemaic Kingdom and two reigning Ptolemaic kings was a problem, and one which Ptolemy XII was eager to deal with. Roman accounts state that he paid an exorbitant, a truly enormous, sum of money to have himself formally recognised as the legitimate ruler of Egypt by the Roman Senate. Ptolemy XII\u2019s willingness to supplicate and bribe Roman allies earned him plenty of contempt from his people and caused him to run up fantastic debts.Marcus Licinius Crassus proposed an annexation of Egypt in 65 BCE, but this was slapped down by his colleague Quintus Lutatius Catulus, probably for fear of the impact this would have on Roman politics. The historian Suetonius even claimed that Julius Caesar proposed a conquest of Egypt and after being denied this he turned his sights on Gaul which would end up being his greatest conquest.This is the point when Roman interest in the Ptolemaic Kingdom really picks up. A tribune named P. Sevilius Rullis proposed a bill which would distribute provincial land to Rome\u2019s citizens, but which carried implicit plans for the conquest of grain-rich land under the legal cover of Ptolemy X Alexander\u2019s will. Cicero delivered two speeches attacking this bill, and (among other things) pointed out that the conquest of Egypt and Cyprus would give the general responsible a power-base outside of Rome, which would result in the destruction of the republic. That might have been very dramatic, but Cicero obviously did resonate with Roman politicians because the bill was never passed.Ptolemy XII\u2019s bribery paid off in 59 BCE, when he was officially recognised as the rightful King of Egypt by the Senate and was designated as a Roman ally. Brilliant, but Cyprus was not included in this deal and the devil is in the details.While all this was unfolding, Ptolemy of Cyprus had some rather unpleasant dealings with Roman politicians. A young politician named Clodius Pulcher was kidnapped by pirates who asked Ptolemy of Cyprus for ransom. Clodius was dismayed and humiliated when the Cypriot king sent a ridiculously small sum, and the pirates thought this was so amusing that they released him anyway. Clodius remembered this incident, and carried a grudge for the King of Cyprus long after. Unfortunately for Ptolemy, this Clodius Pulcher ended up having a rather meteoric career, and came back to haunt him years later.#The actual annexationThe wealth of Cyprus made it an almost irresistible target for an ambitious Roman general, and it might be important to note that money, not Roman glory, was the driving force behind many of the conquests of the Late Republic. Now a tribune and part of Caesar\u2019s political circle, Clodius Pulcher accused Ptolemy of Cyprus of working with pirates from Cilicia, and used this as pretext for the legal annexation of Cyprus in 58 BCE. Cato, a conservative politician and ally of Cicero, was sent to carry out the actual conquest of Cyprus. This was a brilliant opportunity to remove Cato from Rome, while actually earning his favour in the process. The choice of Cato was agreeable to the Senate, and was probably instrumental to the actual approval of this annexation. So Roman accounts give us two reasons for Clodius Pulcher\u2019s plan to conquer Cyprus, revenge and ambition. The wealth obtained by seizing the treasury of Cyprus was immense, but the conquest itself was not so ambitious as to raise alarms back in Rome.Ptolemy XII did not lift a finger to aid his brother, who was left alone to face a Roman invasion (Ptolemy XII ended up paying dearly for this bad decision). When Cato arrived in Rhodes he sent envoys asking for Ptolemy of Cyprus to peacefully abdicate the throne. Ptolemy of Cyprus was given the offer to go into exile and become a priest at the Temple of Aphrodite in Paphos, however he turned this down in favour of suicide. This meant that Cato had no resistance, and Cyprus was added to the province of Cilicia.**Edit:**Only 10 years later, Julius Caesar gave Cyprus back to the Ptolemids for Arsinoe IV and Ptolemy XIV to rule jointly.

It is a copy of a European work, but it is still one of the oldest surviving maps of the Americas, dating back to 1513, and we can therefore say that the Ottomans were aware of the Americas no later than this date, so within 20-odd years of its \"discovery\".The Ottoman Empire did establish diplomatic relations with several countries in the Americas, including the United States, which saw several different ambassadors posted to Washington, perhaps most famously Alexander Mavroyeni, an Ottoman Greek. There were consulates in South America as well, not surprisingly as Brazil and other countries experienced large-scale migration from the Ottoman Empire in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.Which brings us around to other early Ottoman sources on the Americas. I recall reading about an Ottoman Chaldean Christian who wrote first-hand about time spent in South America with the Spanish or Portuguese but I'm unable to dig up a reference at the moment; ~~assuming I have those details right - and I'm going to keep looking - the work would have been written in Arabic rather than Ottoman Turkish.~~ His name was Ilyas Al-Musuli and spent twelve years in Spanish America (1668-1680) and his writings are collected in this book: *An Arab\u2019s Journey to Colonial Spanish America: The Travels of Elias al-M\u00fbsili in the Seventeenth Century* (although note that he may have *written* in Arabic but he was not an Arab).More on point, there was also the *Tarih-i Hind-i Garbi* (literally, *A History of India of the West*), an Ottoman Turkish manuscript from 1580 that was the primary source of information about the Americas in the Ottoman Empire (and the fourth book printed by \u0130brahim Muteferrika, the first Ottoman printer). Whether *Tarih-i Hind-i Garbi* qualifies as \"a comprehensive understanding of the New World\" is debatable as it was second-hand information and it contains some fantastical descriptions, such as the capture of mermen. There's a short article by Thomas Goodrich, \"Tarih-i Hind-i Garbi: An Ottoman Book on the New World\" about it, as well as other scholarship, which I've not read.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Ottoman Empire lasted from 1299 to 1923.

Two of the biggest tribes in America, the Ojibwe and the Navajo, were relatively recent settlers in the areas they currently primarily occupy. Many of these migration patterns can be determined by linguistic comparisons.The migration of the Navajo was enormous,  spanning the entire vertical spectrum of North America. The Na-Dene language family spans the continent from Alaska to the Four Corners region. Unlike Pueblo residents of this area, who have occupied it for over 10,000 years according to some archeologic records, the Navajo (Dine is really preferable) have only been in the area for an estimated 500-700 years.  The Ojibwe migration from the east coast to the great lakes area is also predicted to have only happened within the 600-800 year time period. The Ojibwe and Cree languages spoken by tribal members in Minnesota, Manitoba, even Saskatchewan bears incredible similarity to other Algonquian languages spoken on the east coast, meaning that movement happened recently and relatively swiftly.  So here you have two of the largest tribal groups in America, who had both just walked across great spans of the continent. They would have encountered other tribal groups, trade networks and waypoints. Cowrie shells, copper, tobacco and other products all show the trade routes other people mention.   I don't think we will ever know exactly what these tribal groups knew about far-flung cultures, but we know that some of the groups WERE far-flung cultures that had relocated and had vast amounts of knowledge about other, far-away parts of North America.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The Native Americans of the East Coast had no idea that the Native Americans of the West Coast existed.

Unfortunately, I could not find anything that discusses ancient Maya typos. What I can tell you, though, is how much labor may have gone into carving hieroglyphs into stone.Elliot Abrams is an archaeologist who really pioneered the study of architectural energetics. Architectural energetics is the study of labor through an analysis of a building. You measure a building, find the volume of materials needed to construct the building, and use rates of work taken from replicative experiments to estimate the amount of time it took to procure construction material, transport the material, and ultimately construct a building. This is what my thesis is on, but I will stick to Abrams' case study.In Abrams' career he has examined numerous buildings at the site of Copan, Honduras. In his 1994 book *How the Maya Built Their World*, Abrams examined residential structures that ranged from a palace for Copan's 13th king to small platforms used by commoners to construct perishable buildings. For Abrams' analysis of the palace, labeled Structure 10L-22, Abrams had to estimate the amount of labor it would take to create the decorative sculpture found at the palace. The sculpture found at the palace ranged from simple decorative elements like bars and dots to more complex designs like glyphs and faces. To create a rate of work, Abrams employed a part-time sculptor from the town of Copan. Using stone tools and locally quarried tuff, a light, porous rock formed by consolidation of volcanic ash that hardens when exposed to air, used in the construction of Copan's buildings, Abrams found that the sculptor was able to replicate complex designs like glyphs and faces at a rate of 89 cm^2 an hour. So, if you had a wall that was 2.5 m high by 5 m wide (125,000 cm^2) and a sculptor worked eight hours a day, it would take a sculptor 175.56 days to carve. This assumes the sculptor made no mistakes and knew what he wanted to write beforehand. This rate of work would change depending on the material and skill of the sculptor.I know this is only a partial answer and may be less than satisfactory, but perhaps it provides a sense of scale and time needed to create such things like hieroglyphs on a wall.---* Abrams, Elliot M.

The Black Hand assisted the Young Bosnians. It's a common misconception, according to sources I've read, to attribute the assassination to the Black Hand. Young Bosnians were an offshoot of The Black Hand at best.Moving along! The main reason for the assassination has to do (as most conflicts do) with international tensions and radical ideology.Bosnia  &  Herzegovina (B & H) had been occupied by Austria-Hungary at the Congress of Berlin in 1878. Prior, it had been ruled by the Ottoman Empire. Now, there was a pretty weird uncertainty in all this. The area was occupied, but not annexed (at first), and the people there considered multiple routes. They could attempt to rejoin the Ottoman Empire, join Austria-Hungary, join a federal Yugoslavia, or join a new Greater Serbia.In 1908, that choice was made for them. The Austro-Hungarian authorities fully annexed the region, partially to prevent Ottoman control being returned, and partially to ward off a possible Serbian invasion (these are likely reasons, I don't pretend to know exactly everything!).Serbians responded with counter-literature, through the Narodna Odbrana (National Defense) organization. They, with over 5,000 members over a few months, were augmented by other groups that wanted to create a Greater Serbia. They spread counter-hegemonic literature, essentially saying that joining the Austro-Hungarians was bad.One of the main groups augmenting National Defense was the Black Hand, an offshoot of the Serbian army. But they weren't the end of it. The increased radicalization of people, including young men who took on a more revolutionary attitude, led to the creation of Young Bosnia, the movement which Gavrilo Princip belonged to. They essentially focused on \"Slavization over Germanization, fighting against attitudes of servility, and removal of alien influences\". They created a sense of national identity and fervor for separation from Austria-Hungary that allowed them to effectively mobilize members in support of their cause. They were attempting assassinations before Princip, too.In June of 1910, a member attempted to assassinate the new governor of the Sarajevo area, General Varesanin. This failed, and Zerajic (the assassin) missed 5 times before killing himself. His body was found. This \"martyr\" status and sense of sacrifice only invigorated the Young Bosnians. It's important to note that not only Bosnians or Serbs were feeling these radicalized ideas. Croatia faced demonstrations at a university in 1912, especially against the rule of Count Cuvaj. The Young Bosnians tried (and failed) to assassinate him as well. The person responsible for the attempt did manage to kill a policeman, and the Chief of the Croatian Department of Information before being caught, however.The Austro-Hungarians, in light of this, were quick to crack down on student protests. Soon, there became an even larger disconnect between the youth and those in power, which made it even more dangerous. Trouble was brewing, by this point.Archduke Ferdinand decided to visit Sarajevo in 1914 to demonstrate the Austro-Hungarian power/interest in the area, to inspect the area (as was his job) at the governor's request. It didn't seem like a big deal to anyone involved, just a formality and indication of care. Now, Gavrilo Princip's cell of the Young Bosnians, so to speak, was led by Danilo Ilic. Princip came up with the idea, upon hearing of the impending visit by the Archduke, to attempt to kill him. Princip ran it by a friend (Nedeljko Cabrinovic), and then recruited another: Trifko Grabez (a schoolmate as well). Now, keep in mind, Princip was still in high school at this time. Young Bosnians is really *Young* Bosnians. Princip approached an old friend/soldier, Ciganovic, but here the story gets vague and murky. We rely on 14-years-later accounts from a co-conspirator, basically.It seems Princip and co. stumbled upon a society of sorts called Death or Life, which Ciganovic and friends founded. They had plenty of enmity towards the Austro-Hungarians, and even met on the site of an assassination in 1868 of a Serbian prince (supposedly, this happened thanks to the Austrians helping the assassins). There, it's recalled that Princip and the others were proposed as the future assassins, and asked to join the society.They were trained, given guns and weapons, and in the meantime, Ilic (the leader of the \"cell\" of Young Bosnians) had recruited more people for Princip to get help.The rest, as they say, is history. The assassination attempt (though initially failed), ended up working by mere luck on the part of Princip, who saw the Archduke's car after the bomb attempt failed (the bomb was thrown and missed the car) and fired multiple bullets (two or more) at the Archduke and his wife. Both were killed. The intent was to make a statement; martyr oneself for the cause of a greater Serbia and freedom from the Austro-Hungarians, who were viewed as oppressors and aggressors unwanted in Bosnia. The message was sent, without a doubt, but it's doubtful the Black Hand or Young Bosnians knew exactly how it would end up, regardless. At best, they likely hoped for revolts, rebellion, and the ceding of Bosnia to the Serbians. The idea that this would lead to the conflagration it did is definitely missing from their writings, unsurprisingly!Jackson, P.

As such, there is no singular answer here, as different states did things differently, but we can at least talk about a few trends, focusing on the South as it is the region I am most familiar with, and with the caveat that I would *not* firmly state this applies equally to northern states, where the process might have been quite different.To start with, as you seem to suspect, voting didn't always require registration as we think of it today. In the early days of the Republic, voting was a very public, very community oriented act. White men would go to the polls where their eligibility would be decided by the election officials - often the elite and the 'up-and-comers' of the region - their identity affirmed by the community around them. The ballot they would then cast was public. A very basic form of registration did exist in most jurisdictions but it was often the most perfunctory of processes, simply a county official writing up a list of names, and most likely if you *weren't* on that list you would still be able to vote as long as you were recognized by the community. Some states did maintain certain property requirements for certain elections, in in such cases there would be need to demonstrate eligibility, but on the whole it remained a very simple process. In any case, these lists were not overly important to the election process, the most common use simply being to have a number of eligible voters to compare the election returns to at the end of the day to determine turnout (or in rare cases, fraud). The process could feel somewhat hostile, and in all fairness, it kind of was intended to be. This being the days before the Australian (Secret) Ballot, ones vote was known to the community, and was cast under the watchful eyes of ones betters. In the rural south, often the polling place itself would be the plantation home of a local planter. Christopher Olsen describes the electoral process, and the implicit pressures that voters faced, wonderfully in the following passage, which I believe also helps shed light on the idea of identity at the polls too: > Naturally, the board [of police] chose Squire [William] Vick and fellow planters Christopher Field and Dr. Jon J. Ross as election-day inspectors. Neighbors since [Bolivar] county's early days, all three men lived along the river near Bolivar's Landing. This triumvirate sat in judgement on prospective voters, allowing or challenging their rights to democratic privileges. No matter how often the inspectors exercised their authority, the symbolic effect of the setting must have been impressive. As they walked through the gate and approached Vick's front veranda, some voters surely understood the realities of wealth and power displayed there. Casting ballots under the nose, even the watchful eyes, of the county's greatest patrons, young farmers and new residents like A.H. Brice, who had recently arrived from Louisiana with his wife and little else, quickly learned who matters in the neighborhood. [...]  > Once authorized to vote, each man handed his ballot to William E. Starke Jr., the returning officer. Then only 22, Starke already owned thousands of dollars worth of cotton land and over 30 slaves. He was also Peter Starke's nephew. The elder Starke [was a state senator and close friend of Vick]. Moving down the line, each voter gave his name to one of the clerks seated nearby: Robert E. Starke, Peter's son, or Dr. Ross's son John Jr. The implications of such an arrangement could scarcely have escaped most voters, or those seated as inspectors and clerks. For a man unfamiliar with the local power structure, casting his ballot on Vick's porch with the next generation of leadership on hand to learn the routine effectively showed him his place.This slice of life, from election day in 1855, shows several things, I hope. First, how eligibility was enforced within the community. They first had to face the three inspectors, the most powerful men in the area, who had the right to challenge their eligibility in the first place, and from there, they then had to openly cast their ballot in view of the young scions of the county. Variations of this system could be found in other southern states to one degree or other, and allowed the easy perpetuation of the local oligarchies that controlled much of the region. Although generally seen as less corrupt, similar systems were not unusual in the North either, where voting too was a hyper-local community ritual (I won't digress, but [here](_URL_0_) I discuss absentee balloting during the Civil War, and the reluctance to allow any form of voting that was not done in person). Various, basic forms of registration may have existed, but the core part of voter identification was simply being there in person, and known by those around you.But then that whole Civil War thing happened, and that kinda changed things. The herrenvolk democracy became threatened by the end of slavery and enfranchisement of the freedmen, who often could form powerful voting blocs in some areas where they well outnumbered their former enslavers, and resulting, for a brief time, African-American elected officials at every level of government in the South, right up to the US Senate. But of course, this was short lived and the end of Reconstruction signaled the death knell. It is in the post-Emancipation, post-Reconstruction period, and especially the rise of the Jim Crow regime, that we begin to see stricter requirements for voter registration. This was something that was, in fact, anticipated in the drafting of the 15th Amendment, but those who supported more expansive protections failed to win out. Whereas the Amendment as ratified read: > The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.Earlier proposed wording included: > No State shall make or enforce any law which shall deny or abridge to any male citizen of the United States of the age of twenty-one years or over, and who is of sound mind, an equal vote at all elections in the State in which he shall have his actual residence, such right to vote to be under such regulations as shall be prescribed by law, except to such as have engaged, or may hereafter engage, in insurrection or rebellion against the United States, and to such as shall be duly convicted of infamous crime.or alternatively: > No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge or deny to any male citizen of the United States of sound mind and twenty-one years of age or upward the equal exercise, subject to such registration laws as the State may establish, of the elective franchise at all elections in the State wherein he shall have actually resided for a period of one year next preceding such election, except such of said citizens as shall engage in rebellion or insurrection, or who may have been, or shall be, duly convicted of treason or other infamous crime.Including stronger, more specific language, however, was supported by a small, radical group of Republicans, and without compromises within the party, attaining the necessary 2/3 support would have been impossible. In the end this forced the radicals to back the moderates preferred language, which aside from race, left requirements for suffrage to the states, including registration and criminal history. Tragically, these inclusions would not only have provided a framework for preventing the sorts of onerous registration or eligibility requirements that came after the end of Reconstruction, but also prevented disenfranchisement for most felons, another form of voter suppression that was used primarily against African-Americans convicted, rightly or wrongly, of petty crimes. Protecting race, but allowing nominally race-neutral prohibitions might have been closer to the victory moderates wished for *if* Reconstruction had succeeded, but in reality it was a hollow victory at best. The resulting final draft was an \"*ambiguous commitment to the black franchise*\", and its failures would soon be happily exploited to the joy of the white elites of the South, and the detriment to the black, and poor white, populations there for nearly a century. The result, you can probably already guess, but in any case was quite predictable. With the end of Reconstruction and the triumph of 'Redeemer' governments, just about any possible barrier to the voting by African-Americans was implemented. Most famous, perhaps, being literacy tests, but plenty of other mechanisms, including more expansive registration requirements that could be a bureaucratic quagmire for even a quite literate person to navigate, such as requiring documentation of voting history, and subjective tests that could be failed at the whim of the man conducting them. Even though they were clearly targeted primarily at the black population, being *as written* race neutral (the laws, after all, did impact many poor whites, a not-unwelcome byproduct for the white elites), the laws didn't violate the 15th Amendment as passed, although whether courts would have been forceful in upholding the Constitution with the draft language we can only speculate, given that even the ratified language was hardly well enforced (See Giles v. Harris or US v. Cruishank, among others), and registration requirements were waived or ignored in many cases for white persons, such as small-time felons, or with blanket \"Grandfather Laws\" which ensured that they needed to meet *none* of the requirements, essentially.", "label": 0}, {"content": "In the United States we have to register to exercise our right to vote, but we dont have to register to exercise our right to buy guns or to exercise any other right.

They had adopted a foreign policy to not have a foreign policy.  The \"best foreign policy Spain can have is to have none.\"  So no powers were obliged to come to their aid.  To come to their aid it would have taken a major world power.  Spain had About 30 million people in 1898 with 10 million in its colonies mostly the Philippines and Cuba and these were both in near revolt.  The US had 75 million people.  Spain was producing about 2.7 million tons of coal per year.  The US was producing 270 million tons.  Spain was producing 166,000 tons of steel the US was producing 30 million tons.  Some military scholars of the time suggested Spain's superior military tradition would allow them to defeat the Americans.  However, the vast majority saw the US as one of the worlds greatest industrial powers with ships guns and supplies far superior to the Spanish.  Spain had only a single battleship (a battleship that had to refuel to make a voyage from Spain to Cuba) compared to the US navy's seven all of which could easily sail across the Atlantic and immediately begin operations.The US had been experiencing a gradual warming of relations with Great Britain when the Spanish American War began.  Dewey's fleet was cheered by British sailors as it sailed from Hong Kong harbor.  Not to mention the coal which Britain sold to support the US fleet.  Compare this with the Spanish.  Their relief fleet to the Philippines was delayed in Egypt because they were unable to buy coal.  Communications sent by telegraph were officially neutral it was agreed that communications sent by land would be passed uninterrupted but that communications from ships to land would not be passed on without approval.  The British who controlled most of the cables regularly broke this rule providing communication to US forces but not Spanish.The US fleet in the Philippines was actually shadowed by a German fleet.  The German fleet broke the US blockade and provided supplies to the Spanish in Manila.  They only ceased provoking the Americans when Dewey threatened to fire on the more powerful German fleet.  The Germans had hoped that a prolonged conflict in the Philippines would allow Germany to acquire the Philippines as a colony.Similarly Russia also hoped to take possession of Spanish held Pacific Islands to use for refueling bases.From the outset of the war it was clear to most nations that the US would likely emerge the victor.  This meant that Spain not the US would require an ally.  The allies who could have made a difference were Germany, Britain, France, Italy, Austria-Hungary, Russia and little known at the time but also Japan.Germany was interested in trying to scoop up territories and may have sided with Spain for this goal if the conflict had continued long enough.  Britain was pro-US and unlikely to support Spain.  France required US coal and steel and was courting favor with Britain against Germany.  They had no interest in chasing a conflict around the globe that would weaken their interests at home.  Italy was still defining itself as a nation and could little afford a major conflict.  Austria-Hungary didn't have the naval force to intervene in a conflict so far away.  Russia was unconcerned except for their desire to acquire some refueling bases in the Pacific they saw the most likely path to this through neutrality and then bargaining with the victor.  Japan also required US steel and coal and the US acquiring more routes to ship through would have helped this goal.Basically the Nations of Europe were too afraid of each other to begin a war against the United States.  They were also afraid that intervening for the US could lead to war against another European power.

It is loosely implied that they are in a field camp company area of A company, 2/47th, 9th Infantry Division at an unspecified date. The scene resembles like a big beach party with The Four Tops' *I Can't Help Myself* blaring in the background. In the background, dozens of UH-1 'Huey' helicopters pass through. We, as a viewer, know we're in South Vietnam. The choppers, the 60s music, the casual soldiers - but it's still *glaringly* different from anything we have to come to expect from a depiction of South Vietnam. What gives?The scene continues. We get our first interaction between Gump and Lt. Dan. Upon saluting, Lt. Dan tells Gump and Bubba to not salute him because \"there are goddamn snipers all around this area who would love to grease an officer.\" He then welcomes them to \"Fort Platoon\" (a fictional name). Immediately, we know they're close the field and in the presence of the enemy - yet the behavior of all the soldiers around them are the opposite of what you would expect. Yet, the scenes that follow which shows Gump and his fellow soldiers out on patrol all stick to a somewhat realistic depiction. Once more, what gives?The first thing we need to keep in mind, as we always should when dealing with film, is that it is *fiction*. Therefore, the choices that have been made are not necessarily drawn upon realism in as much as a fictionalized realism, a construction of what the Vietnam War was. Historians dealing with film and fiction today does not focus as much on what films get wrong but rather *why* they get it wrong. What's the purpose of the choices they've made in their depiction? Clearly, in the case of *Forrest Gump*, it is establishing that we're in the fictional land of pop culture Vietnam War drawn from previous movies like *Apocalypse Now* (the Huey's in the background clearly drawing from it), *Full Metal Jacket* (the entire introduction of Gump to military life is drawing from it) and *Platoon* (which we can attribute the later scenes in the bush). I could for example point out that the 2/47th was a mechanized battalion and that Gump would [have been patrolling on an M-113](_URL_0_) in real life -- but that's not going to help us understand the *purpose* of this scene.Instead, I'd point out to the quote that I started this answer with. To Forrest Gump, South Vietnam was very different from the United States. In this, he was not alone. American soldiers had very mixed reactions upon encountering South Vietnam for the first time. The heat, the strange customs, behavior, and language of the South Vietnamese people as well as the smell are all things American soldiers felt were strange to them. But even familiar military life put in contrast to the danger of being in South Vietnam could be strange. Take this account as an example: >  We flew into Cam Ranh Bay and as we were coming in I\u2019m looking out my window and as we are coming close to the ground I can see village huts. I saw some destroyed vehicles such as tanks or some kind of destroyed vehicles and I thought, \u201cOh, man. We\u2019re landing right in the middle, landing right in a hot zone.\u201d I\u2019m looking around and I said, \u201cMan, they should be passing out weapons anytime now. We\u2019re going into a war zone.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to expect and I kept waiting. \u201cWhere\u2019s our weapons? Where\u2019s our weapons?\u201d The plane lands and as we taxi around now I\u2019m looking out of the other side of the window and what do I see? I see a beautiful bay. I see white silver sands. You know, it\u2019s a military installation but there is people walking around with their shirts off, they\u2019ve got a nice tan. I said, \u201cMan, this is Vietnam? This looks like Hawaii or some place.\u201d Now I wasn\u2019t as scared as I was when we first landed. When we got off the plane then it hit you, the heat and the humidity.The soldier in question, Arthur Wiknik of the 101st Abn.

It is a telling account similar to what we're seeing depicted in the movie, but Wiknik is going from a presumed dangerous warlike situation to a mellow, administrative setting in the rear. I'd like to argue that Gump's experience is the reverse -- without him knowing or recognizing it as such. It can therefore be suggested that the *purpose* of the scene is not to show the reality of camp life in the Vietnam War but rather to show how Gump is reacting to his new reality in a foreign country, yet we do know that Gump thinks and conceptualizes things very different from us. Therefore, it is only fitting that a beach party in a war zone is shown to us to put us there with Gump: Yeah, this is very different. For Gump, it was everything except for the beer cans and the barbecue. For us, it *is* the beer cans and barbecue that is different from previous depictions of the Vietnam War on film.", "label": 0}, {"content": "The scene was depicting the soldiers getting ready to go to war.
